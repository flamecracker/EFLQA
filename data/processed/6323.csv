"The concept of chivalry originates from the French word ""cheval,"" meaning horse. A knight was a young man from a noble family allowed to bear arms. In tales like ""How the Child of the Sea was made Knight"" and ""The Adventures of Sir Gareth,"" we witness the journey of boys growing up at King Arthur's court. Becoming a knight was no easy task; boys were taken at a young age to serve a king or knight. They began as pages, learning skills like carving, hunting, and riding. By fourteen, they became squires, mastering horseback riding with armor and tilting with a spear. To become a knight, a boy underwent a solemn ceremony involving fasting, prayer, confession, and receiving a blessing. The knight's main duty was to fight for those in need, showcasing their skills in tournaments and jousts, the primary public entertainment of the time. Chivalry embodied virtues like truthfulness, loyalty, and helping the weak, shaping the character of English people."|"['1. What is the origin of the concept of chivalry?\nA.

Long ago in Britain, a king named Uther Pendragon sought the love of Igraine of Cornwall. When she rejected him, Uther fell ill. The powerful magician Merlin offered to help Uther in exchange for his unborn son. Uther agreed, and Merlin transformed Uther to resemble someone Igraine loved.

Horn arrived late at Rimenhild's wedding feast and needed to be cautious to save her. He left his men on the ship and landed alone. On his way to the palace, he encountered a pilgrim and decided to swap clothes with him to blend in at the feast. When he reached the gates, a porter tried to stop him, but Horn pushed through and entered the hall. He sat among the beggars and noticed Rimenhild weeping. Horn disguised himself as a fisherman and asked for wine, not ale. Rimenhild, puzzled, gave him wine. Horn then revealed his true identity by dropping a ring into the cup.

After reuniting with the princess, Horn shared news of his men on the ship. Athulf was summoned, and together they informed the ship's crew, who swiftly joined them at the palace.

In a dream, Horn saw Rimenhild shipwrecked, calling for help but hindered by Fikenhild.

Ogier, growing more handsome and amiable each day, excelled in form, strength, and address among his noble peers. Attending all tourneys and eager to imitate elder knights, he was a remarkable young man. However, his life took a turn when his mother passed away, and the king remarried, having a son named Guyon. The new queen, fearing Ogier's favor over Guyon, delayed his homage to Charlemagne. This angered the emperor, who tightened Ogier's captivity until a response from the King of Denmark was received. Despite the tension, Charlemagne spared Ogier's life, making him swear fidelity and stay at court. When the Saracens threatened Rome, Charlemagne led an army, with Ogier proving his valor by saving the emperor in battle. Ogier's heroism shone through as he led the charge against the Infidels, turning the tide of the battle.|"['1.

As Archbishop Turpin conducted a solemn ceremony, Ogier, bloodied and dusty, approached Emperor Charlemagne to present the Oriflamme. The emperor warmly embraced him, mistaking Ogier for Alory. Young Orlando, unable to bear the confusion, rushed to help Ogier, followed by his peers. Charlemagne, deeply moved, knighted Ogier and his companions with his legendary sword, Joyeuse. The emperor's joy turned to concern when he discovered a mysterious message on Ogier's sword, Cortana. Charlemagne, realizing Ogier's destiny was protected by a higher power, vowed to love him as a father. Meanwhile, a challenge from King Carahue of Mauritania led to a confrontation, with Charlot, the emperor's son, fueling the tension.

At daybreak, Sadon and Carahue, accompanied by two pages carrying their spears, headed to the designated meadow. Simultaneously, Charlot and Ogier also made their way there using different routes. Ogier approached calmly, greeted the Saracen knights courteously, and participated in negotiating the terms of combat. Meanwhile, Charlot, the traitor, stayed back and signaled his men to attack. His cowardly band emerged from the woods and surrounded the three knights. Despite the surprise attack, they banded together to fend off the assailants. Carahue's sword broke, and his horse fell, leaving him defenseless. Ogier rushed to his aid, shielding him and providing a fallen foe's sword. In a fit of rage, Charlot attempted to harm Ogier, but Sadon intervened. With the treachery exposed, Carahue and Sadon demanded Ogier's release.

Roland advised the king not to trust Marsilius, reminding him of past treachery. He urged the king to gather the army to besiege Zaragoz and conquer the last pagan stronghold in Spain to end the long war. However, Ganelon disagreed, suggesting that Marsilius had offered everything and there was no glory in fighting a defeated foe. Duke Naymes supported Ganelon's idea of making peace to end the war. When Roland volunteered to go on a peaceful mission, Count Oliver doubted his ability to handle negotiations. Ganelon, fearing for his safety, threatened Roland for openly displaying animosity.

Ganelon, a knight, approached King Charles to request permission to go to Zaragoz, a perilous journey no messenger had returned from. He asked the king to care for his son Baldwin if he didn't return, as Baldwin was the son of the king's sister whom Ganelon had married. Despite Ganelon expressing concerns about Roland and his companions, King Charles encouraged him to take on the mission. Ganelon, known for his sharp words, received the king's blessing but dropped the glove given to him, causing concern among the Franks. King Charles reassured them, and Ganelon set off on his journey.

Charles and his companion rode swiftly until they reached the mountain peak overlooking the Valley of Roncesvalles. They sounded their trumpets, but the valley remained silent, with only echoes bouncing off the mountain walls. As they descended through mist, they witnessed the aftermath of a fierce battle: Roland, Oliver, the archbishop, and many valiant warriors lay dead. Charles, who had raised Roland from infancy to become a brave knight, was heartbroken. He longed to have Roland back, willing to trade all his conquests. The Franks caught up with the pagans near the river Ebro, leading to a devastating defeat for the pagans, except for Marsilius who sought aid from Baligant. Charles returned to Roncesvalles to honor the fallen heroes, preserving their bodies in marble coffins. Eventually, Charles avenged Roland by conquering Spain. However, upon returning to France, his victory felt hollow without Roland. The people welcomed him, but Hilda, who loved Roland, sought him in vain.|['1.

Charles was deeply troubled and tearful. He told his sister that he couldn't bring the dead back to life. His nephew Roland, a dear friend and captain, was no more. Charles urged his sister to mourn and heal, promising to give her his son Louis in place of Roland. Seeking justice, Charles summoned men from various lands to investigate if Ganelon had betrayed him. Ganelon, accused of treason, manipulated the trial by bribing judges, including Pinabel, a cunning and intimidating man. Despite Ganelon's defense, Thierry, a brave young lad, accused Ganelon of treachery and challenged anyone to defend him. Thierry offered his glove as a pledge to fight for justice.|['1.

Pinabel, a large figure in the crowd, challenged Thierry to a deadly battle before King Charles. The Franks doubted Thierry's ability, hoping for a more experienced champion. However, the king trusted in God's judgment. The battle took place near Aachen, starting with a joust and then continuing on foot. Thierry was agile but struggled against Pinabel's strength. Pinabel offered Thierry a deal to end the fight, but Thierry refused, relying on God's will. In the intense battle, Thierry seemed doomed until he struck a fatal blow, defeating Pinabel. The people cheered, and King Charles embraced Thierry. Meanwhile, Charlemagne faced challenges due to his son's cruel actions, leading to conflicts with Rinaldo and his brothers.

Once upon a time, Rinaldo faced a challenging situation. He sent a messenger to offer his castle in exchange for his and his brothers' lives to the king. Impatient for news, Rinaldo rode out to meet the messenger. However, he fell asleep in the woods while waiting, and his horse, Bayard, wandered off. Some locals found Bayard and decided to take him to King Charles for a reward. When Rinaldo woke and realized his horse was missing, he despaired. An old man approached him, offering words of comfort. Rinaldo, feeling helpless, gave the old man his spurs and later his mantle, hoping for divine help to save his brothers and himself.

Once a pilgrim, now revealed as Malagigi, met Rinaldo on the road. Malagigi disguised them as poor pilgrims to approach the court where Bayard, Rinaldo's horse, would be shown. They overheard that Bayard was now with Charlot, and the king planned to hang Rinaldo's brothers. The monks shared this news. Malagigi, now in armor, asked for alms, receiving a golden cup. On the feast-day, Malagigi returned Rinaldo's spurs, hinting at their use. At the court, the king noticed the cup and sent Charlot to inquire.

The king was impressed by Malagigi and Rinaldo, considering them holy men. Malagigi revealed that the cup he owned was purchased with money saved from years of begging. The king was intrigued and asked for a sip from the cup to cleanse his sins. However, when Malagigi requested forgiveness for all who had wronged the king, he refused, especially against Rinaldo and Malagigi. The king then noticed a deaf, dumb, and blind man beside Malagigi, seeking a cure through Bayard the horse. The king agreed to let the man ride Bayard for healing. As Rinaldo mounted Bayard, he miraculously regained his senses. The king, amazed, decided to celebrate the miracle with a grand procession. Later, Rinaldo, feeling unwatched, rode off on Bayard, leaving everyone behind in awe.|"['1.

Malagigi didn't go far, but he changed his appearance and went back to where the king was. He used his best skills to free Rinaldo's brothers from prison. He succeeded, and all three made it safely to Montalban. Rinaldo was overjoyed at the rescue of his brothers and the recovery of Bayard. King Falangiez ruled in Great Britain and passed away without heirs. His brother Lisuarte, a noble and wise man, married Brisena, the fairest lady in the islands. After the king's death, the people asked Lisuarte to be their king. Lisuarte, along with his wife Brisena and their daughter Oriana, sailed with a fleet to assume the throne. Oriana, a young girl of exceptional beauty, was left in the care of King Languines in Scotland. The Child of the Sea, a young man serving the queen, desired knighthood to earn the respect of his beloved Oriana. When the king learned of this, he promised to make him a knight.

When Vellido Dolfos heard that Donya Urraca was willing to grant any request to the one who could relieve Zamora and end the siege, he saw an opportunity. Vellido went to King Don Sancho's camp and deceived the king, making him believe that he could help conquer Zamora. The traitor convinced the king that he knew a secret entrance to the town. However, the noble knight, the Cid, suspected Vellido's treachery and tried to stop him. The Cid almost caught Vellido but was unable to prevent him from entering Zamora. Vellido then committed a heinous act by fatally stabbing King Don Sancho. Despite the Cid's efforts, he couldn't stop the traitor from escaping.

In the past, Vellido Dolfos sought refuge with Infanta Donya Urraca in Zamora, fearing retribution. Don Arias Gonzalo urged the Infanta to hand over Vellido to the Castillians to avoid dishonor for Zamora. The Infanta agreed to spare Vellido's life. Meanwhile, the Castillians found their wounded king, who revealed that Vellido had betrayed him. The king sought forgiveness for his sins before passing. The Castillians decided to impeach Zamora for the king's death. Don Diego Ordonez accused Zamora of harboring Vellido, challenging them to combat.

After a truce was declared, twelve alcades were chosen on each side to determine the rules for combat for those who challenged a council.

Each combat would be followed by fresh arms, a horse, three bread sops, and a drink. The other twenty-two alcades agreed. Lists were marked near the river, with a bar in the center. Combatants had nine days to prepare. Don Arias Gonzalo sought the truth about King Don Sancho's death.

Once upon a time, the king laughed heartily as the townsfolk hurried away in a rush. He then called them back and revealed that he had been in the forest where he had forgiven Robin Hood. The people were ecstatic to learn that the tall outlaw was actually their king. They celebrated with dancing and feasting. King Edward restored Sir Richard Lee's lands, praising his loyalty. Robin Hood, now at court, soon realized he had spent all his money on knights and squires. Left with only two loyal companions, he longed for the greenwood. Overwhelmed with sorrow, he sought the king's permission to return to Barnsdale. When he arrived, the forest's beauty lifted his spirits, and he resumed his archery skills, calling his band of outlaws back together.|"['1.

When the local butchers opened their shops, Robin decided to open his own, even though he had never sold anything before. Surprisingly, Robin's meat sold quickly and he had more customers than the other butchers. The reason was simple - Robin offered more meat for less money. This made the other butchers curious about Robin, thinking he must be a wasteful person squandering his money. The sheriff, noticing Robin's success, believed he had a lot of cattle and land to sell. The sheriff approached Robin, who confirmed he had hundreds of horned beasts and acres of land to offer. The sheriff, eager for a good deal, rode with Robin to the forest of Sherwood. Robin then surprised the sheriff by giving him all the gold from his portmanteau and sending him back home on his own horse.|"['1.

They agreed to send a knight with a hundred bowmen to capture Robin Hood. The knight went with letters from the king, but Robin Hood refused to surrender. A fierce battle ensued, lasting until both sides were exhausted. Many were injured, and the knight was killed. Robin Hood's strength waned, and he knew his end was near. He asked to be buried in the forest he loved. The story of Don Quixote, a man who wanted to be a chivalrous knight, is also told.

Enthusiastically, he delved into reading books, often spending entire days and nights absorbed in tales of enchantments, battles, and impossible adventures. His brain, weary from little sleep and excessive reading, led him to believe in the truth of romantic stories over historical facts. This conviction drove him to become a knight-errant, seeking adventures and righting wrongs. He meticulously prepared himself, transforming old rusty armor, naming his horse Rozinante, and adopting the title Don Quixote of the Mancha. Desiring a lady to whom he could dedicate his feats, he chose Aldonca Lorenso, renaming her Dulcinea of Toboso. Fully armed and armored, he set out on his quest for justice, unaware that he lacked the proper knighthood to engage in combat, a realization that momentarily shook his resolve.|"[""1.

He traveled all day until he and his horse were exhausted and hungry. Searching for a castle to spend the night, he spotted an inn by the highway. As he rode towards it, he imagined the inn as a grand castle with turrets and a moat. Approaching the inn, he saw two peasant women and mistook them for noble ladies. Hearing a horn, he thought it was a dwarf announcing his arrival. The women laughed at his knightly manners, but he assured them of his chivalry. The innkeeper, a plump man, welcomed him and helped him dismount. The women tried to remove his armor, but the helmet was stuck. Despite hunger, he refused to remove the helmet. The innkeeper fed him poorly cooked haddock and bread while the women assisted him in eating. To drink, the innkeeper poured wine down a cane into his mouth.|['1.

As Don Quixote sat down for supper, he believed he was in a grand castle where the stale food seemed exquisite, and the innkeeper appeared as the castle constable. Eager to be dubbed a knight, Don Quixote knelt before the innkeeper, requesting the honor. The innkeeper, amused by Don Quixote's antics, agreed to knight him the next morning. Don Quixote then took his armor to the stable, declaring he would spend the night guarding it in the chapel. The innkeeper, playing along, directed him to watch his armor in the yard due to the chapel's renovation. As Don Quixote patrolled with his lance, the innkeeper shared the story with other guests. Later, carriers attempted to move the armor, leading to a comical scuffle where Don Quixote defended his gear with fervor. The innkeeper, realizing the situation was escalating, decided to knight Don Quixote immediately to avoid further chaos.|"['1.

Don Quixote was eager to obey the innkeeper and become a knight. The innkeeper, fearing Don Quixote's threats, hurriedly conducted the knighting ceremony. Don Quixote was dubbed a knight through a comical and absurd ceremony. Two women staying at the inn assisted in the ceremony, becoming known as Lady Tolosa and Lady Molinera at Don Quixote's request. After the ceremony, Don Quixote quickly mounted his horse, Rozinante, ready to seek adventures. He convinced his neighbor, Sancho Panza, to become his squire with promises of future glory. As they journeyed, Don Quixote shared his belief in winning an island and making Sancho its governor. Sancho, though skeptical, agreed to accompany Don Quixote on his adventures.

Don Quixote, a valiant knight, mounted on his trusty steed, Rozinante, charged towards what he believed were giants but turned out to be windmills. Ignoring his loyal squire Sancho Panza's warnings, Don Quixote bravely faced the windmills, mistaking them for his enemies. As the windmill's sails began to turn in the breeze, Don Quixote boldly declared his intent to conquer them. Despite his courageous efforts, the windmill's blades shattered his lance, sending him and Rozinante tumbling to the ground. Remaining undeterred, Don Quixote attributed this misfortune to the sorcery of an old foe, Freston. He believed Freston had transformed the giants into windmills to thwart his triumphs. Don Quixote instructed Sancho to refrain from intervening in battles against noble foes. Amidst this confusion, two friars and a coach carrying a Biscayan lady crossed paths with Don Quixote. Mistaking the friars for enchanters and the lady for a captive princess, Don Quixote charged at them, causing chaos and leading to a humorous encounter with Sancho. Despite the comical mishaps, Don Quixote remained steadfast in his chivalrous quest, offering his aid to the lady and demanding her gratitude be expressed to his beloved Lady Dulcinea of Toboso.|"['1.

In a fierce battle, Don Quixote faced the Biscayan, who struck him hard over his armor. Don Quixote, feeling the blow, called out for his lady, Dulcinea, and retaliated with a powerful strike that sent the Biscayan reeling. The Biscayan, bloodied and shaken, almost fell off his mule but managed to hold on. As the fight ended, Don Quixote, with great dignity, granted the Biscayan mercy under one condition. Meanwhile, Sancho, loyal squire to Don Quixote, expressed his desire for a reward. Don Quixote assured Sancho that greater adventures lay ahead. Riding on, Don Quixote asked Sancho if he had ever seen a braver knight, to which Sancho, unable to read or write, praised his master's courage.

Sancho got up, feeling sore, and quietly approached the innkeeper in the darkness. He requested rosemary, oil, wine, and salt to help the wounded knight-errant, Don Quixote, who was groaning in bed from injuries inflicted by a Moorish enchanter. The innkeeper, thinking Sancho was out of his mind, provided the items. Sancho took them to Don Quixote, who believed the concoction was a miraculous cure. Sancho, impressed by his master's recovery, asked for the remaining mixture but suffered severe pain and regretted it. Don Quixote, attributing Sancho's illness to not being a dubbed knight, suggested the balsam only worked for knights. Sancho's stomach couldn't handle it, and he groaned in agony for hours, regretting his role as squire. Despite this, Don Quixote, feeling better, prepared for new adventures, mounted his horse, and declared his gratitude to the innkeeper before leaving without paying. The mischievous inn guests then played a prank on Sancho, tossing him in a blanket in the yard, prompting Don Quixote to return and scold them for their mistreatment of his squire.|"['1.

Despite being scolded, they continued laughing and working, while Sancho flew with his complaints, mixing threats and prayers. They played until exhaustion, then stopped and left him alone. They brought his donkey, helped him mount, wrapped him in his coat, and Maritornes kindly gave him water from the well. Just as he was about to drink, his master warned against water, offering a healing balsam. Sancho, recalling past suffering, refused the balsam, asking for wine instead. After drinking, he rode out, feeling relieved to have paid nothing. Don Quixote believed the inn was enchanted, blaming phantoms for their mistreatment. Sancho suggested returning home to avoid further misadventures. Don Quixote, however, praised knighthood's thrill, promising future triumphs.

Don Quixote, a brave knight, mistook flocks of sheep for mighty armies in a vast plain. His mind was filled with thoughts of battles and adventures from knightly books. He believed the sheep were two armies led by Emperor Alifamfaron and King Pentapolin. Despite Sancho's warnings that they were just sheep, Don Quixote was determined to charge at them, thinking they were enemies. He described imaginary knights and battles to Sancho, who couldn't see them.

Don Quixote was undeterred by the shepherds' stones and continued to call out for the proud Alifamfaron. Despite being struck by a stone that severely wounded him, he sought his balsam for relief. Sancho, observing his master's reckless actions, was frustrated and cursed the day they had met. He believed an enchanter had transformed the enemy squadrons into sheep. Don Quixote, feeling ill from the balsam, explained to Sancho that the enchanter was manipulating their surroundings. Sancho, realizing he had left the cure in his wallet at the inn, contemplated leaving his master. Don Quixote, though suffering from his injuries, comforted Sancho, emphasizing the resilience of knights-errant.

Don Quixote explained to his faithful squire, Sancho, that he was inspired by the legendary knight-errant Amadis of Gaul. Don Quixote intended to imitate Amadis by performing a penance for his beloved lady, Dulcinea, who he believed to be the most precious lady in the world. They arrived at the foot of a tall mountain surrounded by a serene river and lush meadows, where Don Quixote decided to begin his penance. Sancho, always practical, suggested saddling Rozinante again for their journey. Don Quixote, committed to his chivalrous ideals, insisted on following the rules of knighthood, even if it meant enduring real hardships.

If Don Quixote inquired about delivering the letter to Dulcinea, Sancho was to claim he had, but she had sent word for his return. Eager to see Don Quixote resume his adventures, Sancho suggested going ahead, hoping the message from Dulcinea would suffice to lure him away from the mountains. As Sancho departed on the scorching August afternoon, a melodious voice captivated the two resting travelers. The singer's sorrowful song intrigued them, prompting a search.

While the curate and Cardenio were busy, the curate came up with a clever plan. He used scissors to cut off Cardenio's rugged beard and neatly trimmed his hair. Then, he draped his riding-cloak over Cardenio, transforming his appearance completely. When they joined Don Quixote and the others, the curate warmly welcomed Don Quixote as a champion of the distressed. As they prepared to leave, the barber tried to mount the mule behind the curate but was kicked off, losing his beard in the process.

Dorothea, who was discreet, reminded Don Quixote of his promise not to embark on any other quests until he had helped her. Don Quixote agreed and asked Dorothea to share her troubles. She revealed that she was Princess Micomicona, heiress to the Kingdom of Micomicon, threatened by a giant named Pandafilando. Her father's prophecy led her to seek Don Quixote's aid. Sancho joyfully accepted Dorothea as his queen, causing laughter among the group. Don Quixote, lost in thought, vowed to help Dorothea but explained he couldn't marry due to his devotion to Dulcinea. Sancho's protest led to a scuffle, with Don Quixote defending Dulcinea's honor. Dorothea intervened, preventing a serious clash. Don Quixote emphasized that Dulcinea's valor was behind his achievements, not his own strength alone.|"['1.

Sancho was not too injured to hear his master's words. He quickly got up and followed behind Dorothea's horse, urging his master to marry the queen they had with them, as he had never seen Lady Dulcinea. Dorothea advised Sancho to apologize and not speak ill of Lady Dulcinea. Later, Sancho recognized a robber, Gines of Passamonte, disguised as a gipsy, and his beloved donkey, Dapple. Sancho confronted Gines, demanding the return of his donkey. He then embraced Dapple, showering him with affection. Don Quixote asked Sancho about delivering the letter to Dulcinea, wanting to know every detail without embellishment.

After finishing their meal, they mounted their horses and rode all day and the next without any significant incident until they reached the inn. Sancho Panza dreaded this place but had no choice but to enter. The innkeeper, his wife, daughter, and Maritornes warmly welcomed Don Quixote and Sancho. Don Quixote, with dignity, requested a better bed this time. He was given a decent one in the same room. Exhausted, he went straight to bed. During dinner, they discussed Don Quixote's peculiar behavior, with the hostess sharing the story of his fight with the carrier. The innkeeper praised the joy of reading books, but the daughter preferred the knights' love stories. Sancho overheard them questioning the usefulness of knights-errant and vowed to see his master's journey through before returning home. Suddenly, Sancho burst in, claiming Don Quixote was in a fierce battle. Rushing to the room, they found Don Quixote asleep, imagining he was fighting a giant. The innkeeper, mistaking wine bags for slain giants, furiously attacked Don Quixote until he was drenched awake by a kettle of cold water.|"['1.

The innkeeper was frustrated by the chaos caused by Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Sancho, in his confusion, believed his earldom would vanish if he didn't find the giant's head. The innkeeper insisted they pay for the damaged wine-skins. Meanwhile, Don Quixote, mistaking the curate for a princess, knelt before him, thinking he had completed his quest. The group managed to get Don Quixote back to bed, leaving him to rest. They tried to console Sancho, who was upset about not finding the giant's head. The innkeeper and his wife were upset about the ruined wine-skins. Dorothea promised to reward Sancho once Don Quixote had defeated the giant.

At last, the masked man approached Dorothea and warned her not to offer anything to the woman, claiming she was ungrateful. Cardenio overheard this and exclaimed in surprise. The lady, upon hearing this, tried to enter the room but was stopped by the man. As he held her, his mask fell, revealing he was Dorothea's lover, Don Fernando. Overwhelmed, Dorothea fainted, saved from falling by the barber. The curate helped revive her as Don Fernando turned pale. Lucinda, seeing this, asked Don Fernando to let her go, declaring her loyalty to Cardenio. Dorothea, upon waking, tearfully reminded Don Fernando of their promise, pleading for his return. Touched, Don Fernando embraced her, acknowledging defeat. Lucinda, in turn, embraced Cardenio, declaring him her true love.

In silence and tears, they arrived at an inn, a place they would always cherish as the most beautiful in the world. Sancho was disheartened to learn his dreams of an earldom were shattered, and Princess Micomicona was revealed as Dorothea. Don Quixote, unaware in his slumber, had vanquished a giant that turned out to be a wine bag, much to Sancho's dismay. Despite the confusion, everyone found contentment and joy. The innkeeper was jubilant as Cardenio and the curate promised to cover the damages caused by Don Quixote. Sancho, feeling downcast, informed his master of the unfolding events. Don Quixote, undeterred, believed it was all due to enchantment. The group prepared to depart, with Don Quixote appearing in full armor, ready for new adventures.|"['1.

The clever Dorothea spoke, and Don Quixote, feeling greatly offended, turned to Sancho and scolded him, calling him a little rascal. Don Quixote accused Sancho of deceiving him about the princess and the giant's head, which turned out to be a wine-skin. Sancho defended himself, admitting a mistake about the princess but insisting the giant's head was indeed a winebag. Don Fernando intervened, suggesting they move on from the topic and enjoy the evening. As they sat down for supper, Don Quixote took the main seat, insisting the Lady Micomicona sit beside him. They had a pleasant meal, listening to Don Quixote's tales of knightly adventures. Don Quixote, feeling free from quarrels, decided it was time to continue his quest. He knelt before Dorothea, suggesting they leave the castle to avoid any potential danger from their enemies. After two days, the group devised a plan to transport Don Quixote back home without causing Dorothea and Don Fernando any inconvenience. They disguised themselves and, while Don Quixote slept, they captured and confined him in a cage to bring him back to his village, ending his delusions.|"[""1.
