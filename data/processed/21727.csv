His school books were filled with drawings, and he decorated his nursery with his artwork. Despite his uncle's indifference, Frank expressed his desire to become an artist at thirteen. His uncle, a man focused on work, food, and sleep, pushed him to choose a profession. Frank, feeling neglected but respectful, defended his skills in math and penmanship.

"""I thought so; the old story. No, sir, you shall never be an artist--at least not with my consent. Why, do you suppose that because you can scribble caricatures on the fly-leaves of your books you have necessarily the genius of Rubens or Titian?""

""Not quite,"" replied Frank, smiling in spite of himself at the irascibility of the old gentleman, ""and yet I presume that Rubens and Titian began to paint before either themselves or others were aware of the fact that they possessed any genius at all.""

""I have studied much, uncle,"" said Frank eagerly, ""although I have said little to you about the matter, knowing your objection to it; but if you would condescend to look at a few of my drawings from nature, I think--""

Nature, sir, is only fit for savages. There is nothing natural now-a-days.

Joe and Frank had a conversation about their journey to the gold mines. Joe suggested selling off their supplies for a profit to the diggers. Frank, however, declined the idea and expressed his intention to join a party heading to the mines. The next morning, they were all set to depart with a diverse group of men, including Californians, Chinamen, Malays, Americans, and others. They traveled together for protection and assistance. Joe had arranged to have his belongings carried by pack mules. The journey took them through beautiful park-like lands with oak and sycamore trees, heading towards the Sierra Nevada mountains. Along the way, they met a friendly American named Jeffson, who shared his experiences as a storekeeper at a distant dig site.

A man informed the group that they had a forty-mile journey ahead in scorching heat without water until the halfway point. Despite the initial confidence, the walk on ankle-deep sand under the sun proved challenging. The heat cracked the earth, sending sand columns through the air, causing discomfort. As thirst grew, even the most reluctant turned to their water supplies. Approaching night, the thirst intensified, but the guides revealed they couldn't reach water until the next day. Exhausted and disappointed, some shared water while others lay silently. At dawn, they dug desperately for water, realizing their dire situation.

As they journeyed, the mules struggled under the harsh whip, their eyes glazed with pain. Despite their agony, they stumbled forward, forced by the goad. Graddy, unable to bear the sight, pressed on silently. Frank, battling his own thirst, resisted the urge to drink the dwindling water. The scorching heat and relentless thirst made the group discard belongings in desperation. Bradling, driven to madness by brandy, begged for water, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Some, though unwilling to share, sacrificed for friends. Delirium set in as exhaustion took its toll. Bradling's curses echoed as he was left behind. Bradling's desperation prompted a change of heart in Frank, who offered him a precious sip of water. As they reached the river, relief washed over them, and plans were made to aid those left behind.

Frank, a brave and compassionate man, stood up against the majority who were unwilling to help their fellow travelers in need. He believed that aiding others in distress was a duty guided by reason and humanity. Despite facing resistance from the guide, Frank's determination to assist prevailed. A Yankee traveler also stepped in, offering to pay for the mule carrying his goods to help resolve a dispute. Eventually, a compromise was reached, and the travelers continued their journey. Along the way, they encountered a well-wooded area abundant with game, providing a pleasant diversion. The guide, once separated from his comrade, proved to be helpful and facilitated harmony among the travelers.

The flicker of a flame works wonders! It banishes loneliness and creates a sense of home. Before the fire, the eye wanders aimlessly in the dim light, lost among unfamiliar shapes. But as the fire grows, darkness is pushed back, and thoughts are drawn to the warmth and light. Our group felt the change as spirits lifted with the dancing flames. Laughter filled the air as stories were shared. Joe Graddy, a seasoned traveler, spoke of his adventures around the world, comparing them to the joys of life in the woods.

The poor, starving Indian appeared squalid and dirty, barely able to stand from hunger. He devoured the offered pork with the ferocity of a wild animal. The party found his behavior amusing and decided to test his appetite by offering more food. However, the Indian suddenly stopped eating, groaned in agony, and fell to the ground. Although they feared he had eaten himself to death, he eventually recovered and left under the moonlight. The group settled down for the night, creating a fire to keep wolves away. Just before sleep, heavy footsteps were heard, causing alarm among the group. Bradling, mistaking a stranger for a threat, fired his revolver, injuring the man. The group was shocked by the sudden violence, with Joe Graddy warning Bradling of the consequences of his actions.|"[""1.

Frank pushed Bradling away forcefully and checked on the wounded man. Meanwhile, the other man aimed his gun at Frank's back, fired, and fled into the woods. Despite attempts to shoot him as he escaped, there was no sign of hitting him. The injured man received basic care but couldn't provide any information about himself. They left him at a nearby ranch for treatment, pooling money found on the stranger to cover costs. The rancher was kinder than expected. As they settled in for the night near a stream, they encountered a group of friendly Indians who could speak some Spanish. After a meal, Frank and Joe observed the Indian village, noting its unique dome-shaped huts made of clay and saplings.

The leader mistook this as a clue and promptly offered gold-dust in exchange for ammunition, but Rance declined, wary of potential betrayal. The chief had to settle for harmless weapons.

Suddenly, a savage attacked Frank, but he fought back and retrieved his weapon. Joe also defended himself.

"As Rance predicted, the Indians were repulsed but gathered on the opposite bank, ready to block the travelers. The group had to act decisively to avoid being outnumbered. Rance and Jeffson, the best marksmen, aimed to scare off the Indians without bloodshed. Firing a shot, they hit two Indians, causing the rest to retreat. Crossing the stream, they saw the Indians prepared for a possible attack. The travelers moved on peacefully, but the thought of the injured Indians lingered.

The journey led them through a beautiful landscape, but the travelers were preoccupied with the day's events. Arriving at Bigbear Gully, they encountered a camp of diggers eagerly awaiting news.

The man from Cornwall explained that the depth of the diggings varied, with a white rock usually found about two feet beneath the soil. He offered to guide the Englishmen to avoid being deceived by scoundrels. They encountered a Yankee man who showed them a claim with gold-dust and nuggets, trying to sell it for a hundred dollars. The Cornwall man warned about scammers who hide gold in valueless claims to trick newcomers. They then observed legitimate gold-washing techniques at the river, where miners used pans and cradles to extract gold from the soil. The process involved washing the dirt until only black sand, containing gold, remained at the bottom of the pan. The gold was separated using methods like magnets or quicksilver.|['1.

In the early days of the gold rush in Bigbear Gully, miners could extract gold dust worth between five to six pounds sterling a day just by washing a panful of dirt every ten minutes. While some miners worked alone with pans, others formed groups and used cradles, which allowed them to extract more gold in less time. A cradle was a simple trough where dirt was placed on a perforated plate, and water was poured over it while the cradle was rocked to separate gold from gravel. Frank and his friends decided to stick together and work as a team after observing different mining methods. They chose a spot by a stream to start their mining operation, built a hut, and purchased necessary tools on credit. Despite Joe's initial concern about costs, they eventually agreed to focus on building the hut first for shelter before digging for gold. The next day, they began their mining operation near the water, with each member assigned specific tasks like digging, carrying dirt, rocking the cradle, and washing the gold.

At noon, following the common practice at the mines, the workers stopped their tasks and headed to the hut for a break. They chatted during their meal, anticipating good outcomes for their efforts. After the hour, they energetically resumed work. As evening approached, they returned to the hut, starting a fire to process the blacksand and gold they had collected. They were eager to see the results of their first day's work before supper! Each batch was dried and sifted, with the gold carefully weighed and collected in a bowl. The miner, Douglas, mentioned the high cost of living at the mines, highlighting the importance of having a designated cook to ensure proper meals and good health. Joe volunteered for the cooking duty, sharing his experience and skills. The day's earnings were discussed, with Frank emphasizing the importance of clearing debts promptly. The next day's yield was positive, boosting their spirits, but a tragic event dampened their mood when one miner murdered another over a gold nugget dispute.|"['1.

In Bigbear Gully, a series of crimes unfolded due to the influx of miners. Cold-blooded murders and thefts became rampant, causing a sense of insecurity. To combat this, the miners took matters into their own hands. A thief caught stealing was subjected to a severe punishment of having his ears cut off and being seared with a red-hot iron. Another thief attempting to steal gold was swiftly sentenced to death by a firing squad. In response to the escalating lawlessness, a stern Yankee proposed new laws to restore order. These laws included severe punishments like ear-cutting, branding, and death for various offenses. The miners, eager for a change, agreed to these strict measures to ensure peace and safety in their community.|['1.

The meeting greatly impacted the miners in Bigbear Gully. Despite the rough and severe actions taken, the miners effectively reduced crimes like stealing and murder. The strict enforcement by Judge Lynch instilled a sense of order in the district. This led to a significant decrease in criminal activities, allowing miners to leave their valuables unattended without fear. However, not all miners found joy in this life. Frank Allfrey, despite his success in digging for gold, despised the laborious work. He longed for a different kind of employment and eventually decided to quit gold-digging. As Frank recovered, his friend Douglas fell ill with dysentery. With no medical help, Douglas's health deteriorated rapidly. Before his passing, Douglas reflected on the value of life beyond gold and the importance of spiritual matters. Frank, along with his friend Joe, decided to leave Bigbear Gully to explore other opportunities, carrying with them valuable life lessons and memories.|"['1.

"""Joe remarked on the new cruising style as they rested under a grand tree, surrounded by stunning scenery. Frank, accustomed to these breaks, set off to sketch the landscape after ordering the vaquero to tend to the mules. The valley, far from the diggings, displayed majestic mountains, lush vegetation, and towering trees. Frank marveled at a colossal pine known as the 'Mother of the Forest,' measuring 360 feet tall and 93 feet in circumference. He also encountered a breathtaking waterfall, cascading over 3,000 feet down a towering precipice.

Frank and Joe pondered the vast, fertile lands in America and the preference of people to live in crowded cities rather than the open countryside. They decided to return to Bigbear Gully by a different route to explore more of the diggings. The next morning, they set out for the Great Canon, a deep gorge rich in gold. The miners there worked individually, using pans and knives to extract gold from crevices and gravel. An old man cleverly extracted gold from black sand using quicksilver. At the Great Canon, huts sold liquor and cards, attracting miners for gambling. Moving on, they reached a creek to test the ground, with the vaquero looking after the mules as they worked with tools to explore the area.|['1.

"They gathered the ""soil"" from a steep slope high above the winter level of the river, in a layer of tough bluish clay, almost as solid as stone, with a light covering of dirt on top. It produced abundantly. By nightfall, they discovered they had washed out gold worth forty pounds sterling! The gold particles were mostly large, some as big as a grain of corn, with occasional nuggets mixed in, along with quartz combinations.

The next morning, as they prepared to leave due to the rainy season approaching, a commotion near their hut caught their attention. A group of men was rushing towards the tavern, dragging a man who was struggling and protesting. Among them was Bradling, a former companion of Frank, accused of murder.

Despite the chaos, Frank stood up for Bradling, emphasizing his innocence. Bradling pleaded for his life, offering his hidden gold as proof of his innocence. The situation was tense, with the crowd divided on Bradling's fate."|"['1.

The man spoke urgently but quietly, prompting Frank to unexpectedly cut the cords that bound him. Bradling fled swiftly, causing chaos as he escaped into the woods, dodging bullets from the miners. As the miners turned their anger towards Frank, a backwoods hunter intervened, revealing that a Redskin, not Bradling, was the murderer. The hunter had even taken down the Redskin responsible. The timely intervention saved Frank and Joe from harm. They hurried back to Bigbear Gully, finding the community in dire straits due to illness, lack of supplies, and the impending rainy season. Frank, eager to leave before the weather worsened, visited Jeffson's store to gather provisions and settle debts.
