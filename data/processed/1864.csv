Early in the day, Stark sent men under Nichols and Herrick to flank Baum's position.

During the early history of the United States, there were instances of American diplomats facing dangerous situations abroad. One such example is Mr. Morris, who showed exceptional courage and loyalty in protecting defenseless individuals against violent mobs. His actions exemplified the noble qualities that should be embodied by those representing the United States overseas. Additionally, the passage discusses a time when the U.S. paid tributes to Barbary powers in North Africa to safeguard merchant vessels in the Mediterranean. Initially following the example of other nations, the U.S. eventually realized the futility of this approach and shifted towards a more assertive stance. The narrative highlights instances where American naval forces, despite facing challenges, demonstrated the effectiveness of a policy based on strength rather than appeasement.|"[""1.

During the War of 1812, American privateers sailed the seas, preying on British trade. These swift-sailing vessels, armed with cannons and manned by brave crews, caused havoc for British ships. The privateers, mainly from the New England coast, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, were expertly crafted and fast. They often engaged in battles with British warships and merchant vessels, disrupting trade routes in the Irish Sea and the British Channel. Although they lacked the formal training of regular navy sailors, some privateers, like the crew of the General Armstrong, commanded by Captain Reid, displayed exceptional bravery and skill.

As the ram emerged from the harbor, it headed towards the Congress and the Cumberland, billowing black smoke from its funnels. The crews aboard the Congress and Cumberland, led by Captain Smith and Lieutenant Morris, were prepared but fearless. The well-trained veterans stood at their posts, ready to defend their flag. The Congress fired first, but the shots bounced harmlessly off the ram's armored sides. The ram retaliated, devastating the Congress and then turning its attention to the Cumberland.
