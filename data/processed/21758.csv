The dinner was a grand affair, filled with noise and excitement. The room was hot, the food excellent, and the din of plates and cutlery was ceaseless. Faces around me were unfamiliar, and the speeches seemed to blend into one another. After some chaos and mischief with other youngsters, we headed to the beach and boarded a boat back to the ship. The journey down the Thames was a blur due to sea-sickness. However, the smell of a delicious salmon-trout brought me back to life. I joined the captain, Mr. Carles, the doctor, Mr. Wiseacre, and the two mates for a meal. The captain was experienced and gruff, Mr. Carles was amiable, the doctor was a mix of seriousness and fun, and Mr. Wiseacre was aloof. The mates were like clockwork, working the ship with efficiency and assurance.|['1.

The captain grunted as he prepared the fish, eager to reach calmer waters. The doctor savored his last meal before a long journey. The captain wished to be sailing towards the ice, eyeing the compass intensely. Mr. Carles noticed ominous clouds behind them, expressing concern. The captain shared a tale of a squall at dinner, causing chaos on a previous voyage. Suddenly, the ship creaked, and the steward struggled to maintain balance. The doctor spotted a change in the wind on the compass. The first mate's voice echoed news of an approaching squall. On deck, the sky darkened, and the sea churned as the crew hurried to secure the ship.|"[""1.

"""Aye, aye, sir!"" called the man steering the ship as a fierce storm hit us, tilting the vessel like a toy in the water. The captain, unfazed, remarked on the strong wind, while a fellow passenger questioned the doctor's sanity. Unfazed, I boasted about the rough weather, though secretly anxious. The ship sailed smoothly to Stornoway, where we met friendly locals. We enjoyed fishing trips and a grand ball on the ship's deck under the moonlight.

The captain, after a lively half-hour of flinging his legs about, suggested using leather or gutta-percha for a partner instead of the heavy fair lady leaning against the mizzen belaying-pins. The captain recounted a comical mishap involving a young, fat, fair lady with big blue eyes who caused chaos on deck. As the revelry continued on the ship, the fiddler's string snapped, briefly halting the fun. The night was filled with laughter, dancing, and a hilarious old gentleman's song and speech. After supper, the cabin was packed with guests, leading to jokes and chaos. Memories of the joyful Stornoway ball and the Gravesend dinner brought bittersweet feelings to the narrator as they sailed through the Atlantic. The monotonous sea journey lacked the excitement of tropical wonders but offered a serene yet lonely experience.|"['1.

As the ships sailed closer to the straits, we enjoyed a few days of companionship. The shores occasionally came into view, and we navigated confidently among the narrow channels and ice mountains that once challenged explorers like Hudson and Gibbons. During a calm day, our ship and the _Prince of Wales_ floated next to each other on the glassy ocean. With no wind in sight, the captain invited us to board the _Prince of Wales_. We were warmly welcomed by old Captain Ryle, along with the chief factor and Mr John Leagues, a fellow apprentice clerk. We spent a pleasant evening together, knowing our paths would soon diverge. Ice began surrounding us, and we encountered our first iceberg, a majestic sight. We sailed through enchanting scenes of icebergs and canals, feeling like we were in a fairytale city. The ship gracefully maneuvered through the ice, occasionally bumping into large chunks. Eventually, we emerged from the ice, grateful for the smooth passage.|['1.

We were all disappointed when the Esquimaux from the coast did not show up as expected. The captain had anticipated their arrival for the annual exchange of ivory and oil for goods like saws and needles. The walrus tusks they usually brought were small and of low quality. As we neared the straits, we fired guns and called out, but there was no response. The captain decided they must have gone inland, so we sailed back out to sea. I was let down by this unexpected turn of events, as we had been looking forward to trading with them. Our ship's guns had actually attracted them to board another vessel behind us. Crossing Hudson Bay was rough, but we were all used to it. I had even become quite skilled at climbing the masts, a challenge I took on with a fellow apprentice. Eventually, we spotted land and anchored near York Factory, where I saw the shores of Hudson Bay for the first time, which looked desolate and flat.|"[""1.

The captain and the skipper exchanged questions and answers as goods were unloaded from the ship. Another schooner arrived, and passengers for the Red River Colony, including a clergyman and his wife, joined us. We left the ship for the schooner but couldn't reach the shore due to the strong tide. The cabin on the schooner was cramped, and we struggled to find a place to sleep. Eventually, I was persuaded to take one of the berths. Despite my protests, I fell asleep, and Mr. Rob comically struggled to stay awake. The night passed with Mrs. Gowley and Mr. Gowley sitting up, and I finally gave in to sleep after much reluctance.|"['1.

After a deep slumber, I was startled awake by a loud thumping sound as our schooner ran aground during low tide. The next morning, despite the beauty of the day, we remained stuck. Eventually, a boat arrived to transport us to shore, but some chose to stay aboard. I, along with Mr. Carles and young Wiseacre, eagerly accepted the ride to land. As we sailed up Hayes River, the landscape appeared desolate, with low marshy land covered in sparse vegetation. The river's banks were clay, and the navigation was tricky due to shallows and sandbanks. Along the way, we encountered an Indian couple in a bark canoe. Finally, we reached York Factory, a bustling trading post with a large staff and a chief factor overseeing operations. The post was a hub for trade and shipment of furs to England, making it a vital link in the fur trade network.|['1.

"The land is flat and swampy, with only a tall wooden ""outlook"" to watch ships and a flagstaff with St. George's flag. Mr. Grave, the chief, welcomed us at the wharf. Mr. Carles took the chief factors to their houses, while Wiseacre and I, as apprentice clerks, went to Bachelors' Hall. It was filled with smoke and noise. I gave a letter to Mrs. Grave, who kindly helped me with moccasins and advice for my journey to Red River. Wiseacre stayed at York Factory. The Hudson Bay Company, formed in 1669, controlled the fur trade around Hudson Bay. The vast territory had forts with few people, mainly men and some women. The forts were spread out like hamlets in a wilderness. The women, mostly half-breeds and Indians, played vital roles in tailoring and daily life in the remote land."|"['1.

In the vast territories of the Hudson Bay Company, missionaries have reached a few cherished locations like the Red River Settlement, where Protestant and Roman Catholic churches stand. The land is divided into four main departments: Northern, Southern, Montreal, and Columbia. Fort Garry and the Stone Fort in Red River are the only true forts, while others are defended by wooden pickets. These posts, scattered across the wilderness, often house only a handful of men and are sometimes without any defenses. The solitary lives led by the Company's employees in these remote areas are a testament to the isolation they endure. Some of the forts include York Fort, Churchill, Edmonton, and many more, each playing a unique role in the Company's operations.|"['1.

In the Hudson Bay Company, various posts like Fort Vancouver, Nez Perce, and Fort Hall employ different grades of workers. The lowest grade is the labourer who does various tasks like cutting firewood and transporting goods. Next is the interpreter, often an experienced labourer who can trade with the natives. Then comes the postmaster, usually a promoted labourer responsible for managing small outposts. Apprentice clerks are young newcomers who quickly adapt to the country's ways. After years of service, they become clerks and eventually chief traders or chief factors. Interestingly, most of the Company's workers are Scottish Highlanders and Orkneymen, with few Irish or English, and many French Canadians and half-breeds among the labourers and voyageurs.|"[""1.

"In the past, bison hides were used to make robes, especially in Canada, where they were used as sleigh wrappers. These robes were also used by Native Americans instead of blankets. Among the furs, the most valuable is the black fox, which is larger than the common fox, jet-black with a few white hairs, and a white tail tip. The silver fox is similar but has more white hairs, making it less valuable. The cross fox is a mix of black or silver and red foxes. The red fox, less valuable but common, is good for trade. White foxes are less valuable than red ones and are abundant near Hudson Bay. The blue fox is not common or valuable, being bluish-grey. Beaver fur, once popular, declined due to silk hats. Marten fur, resembling Russian sable, remains profitable and abundant in the Company's territories like Mackenzie River. Natives trap animals like foxes, deer, and buffalo for fur trade. Trade with natives is done using a standard valuation called a ""castor"" instead of money, with each castor valued at one to two shillings. Natives visit trading posts twice a year, in October and March, to exchange furs for goods."|"['1.

In spring, furs are gathered at outposts, packed in bales, and sent by boats to depots like Fort Vancouver, York Fort, and Moose Factory. From there, ships take them to England. During summer, the land is busy with boats carrying goods and furs. The lakes and rivers bustle with paddles and oars, echoing with the songs of the voyageurs. North American natives, like the Crees, Seauteaux, and others, differ in appearance and customs. Crees are peaceful, trapping and fishing near Hudson Bay. Seauteaux are similar, living further inland. Tribes like the Sioux and Blackfeet hunt bison and deer in the vast plains. Crees, with dark eyes and matted hair, are wiry and tall, wearing capotes and leggings. In winter, they don deer skin capotes and moccasins, decorated with beads and quills.|['1.

The Cree Indian women are described as not particularly attractive, with a dingy brown complexion and unkempt appearance due to extreme filthiness. They are forced into laborious and dirty work by their husbands while the men reserve the pleasures for themselves. The women wear simple gowns made of coarse cloth, with a blanket mostly covering their attire when they go out. They live in conical tents made of deer skin or tree branches, constructed by the men upon arriving at a suitable spot near a stream. The Indian canoe is a light and graceful craft used for travel in rivers with obstacles.

In the past, the food of the Indian people varied depending on their circumstances. Sometimes, they enjoyed meals of deer, partridges, and fat beaver. However, during times of scarcity, they had to rely heavily on fish and even on a substance called _tripe-de-roche_. This substance only delayed their inevitable starvation. In extreme cases of hunger, some Indians resorted to cannibalism. There were accounts of individuals who had consumed their own children and even their spouses. One story tells of Wisagun, a Cree Indian, who, after a series of hardships and starvation, witnessed his wife preparing to cook their child. In a fit of rage, he killed his wife and others, leading to a tragic chain of events that culminated in his own demise. The consequences of his actions left a chilling impact on the community, showing the harsh realities faced by some in their struggle for survival.|"['1.

Indian tribes have a history of enjoying spirits, especially rum, which was once distributed to them extensively. However, under Sir George Simpson's governance, the distribution of spirits has significantly reduced, benefiting the indigenous people. Tobacco is also widely consumed, with the pipe almost always in an Indian's mouth. In their smoking mixtures, a shrub is often added to make the tobacco last longer. Indians are generally lazy but can endure great fatigue and hunger. When they want a wife, they seek the father's consent and then inform the young lady. Indians typically content themselves with one wife, but some may have more based on the husband's ability to support them. When an elderly tribe member becomes infirm, they are left in a tent until their provisions run out, after which they pass away. The Cree Indians, known for their snow-shoe walking, have a distinct attire and use hand-sledges for hunting.|"[""1.

The woods are now dim, the trees above have grown so thick that the moon only shines through in a few spots, casting a strange phosphoric glow on the ground. Stemaw, undeterred, continues his journey with swift, silent steps, sure of his path even as an old snowshoe track disappears. Suddenly, a noise like a rattling chain ahead alerts him. He approaches cautiously and finds one of his traps has caught something. With a swift strike, he ends the trapped black fox's suffering and readies it for his sled. Stemaw's steel traps, larger than rat traps, are used to catch various animals. He resets the trap, conceals it with snow, and scatters bait around. Moving on, he approaches two traps set for coast wolves. A wolf lunges, caught in both traps. Stemaw, armed with an axe, faces the fierce wolf, eventually defeating it after a tense struggle.|"['1.

Stemaw, a resourceful Indian, decides to rest and set up camp in the snowy woods. He carefully clears a space, builds a fire, and settles down to enjoy a pipe of tobacco. As night falls, the fire transforms the dark, cold forest into a warm, glowing spectacle. The snow around him sparkles like diamonds in the firelight, creating a cozy atmosphere. Stemaw relaxes under a pine tree, surrounded by the beauty of nature. The next morning, as the sun rises, he continues his journey, pulling his sleigh towards the beaver-lodges in the distance.

To capture beavers in the winter, a hunter begins by cutting down stakes and driving them into the ground around the beaver-lodge. This prevents the beavers from escaping to their storehouse on the shore. The hunter then stakes up the entrance to the storehouse, trapping any beavers that fled there. With the beavers confined, the hunter uses an ice-chisel to dig through the lodge, a challenging task. Once inside, the hunter pulls out the beavers one by one. The beavers, startled from their slumber, are swiftly dealt with. The successful hunter then heads back to camp, collecting the game left behind. He speeds home to his wife, who eagerly awaits the bounty of fat beavers for food and trade. Additionally, the passage describes a method used by Indians to trap deer by creating a fenced enclosure with snares. When deer are spotted, the Indians drive them into the enclosure for an efficient hunt.|"[""1.

In early September, Mr. Carles, Mr. and Mrs. Gowley, Mr. Rob, and I embarked with the Portage La Loche brigade for Red River colony. The brigade, consisting of six or seven boats, is designed for inland travel where waterways are obstructed by rapids and waterfalls. Crews carry boats and cargo overland at these points, known as portages. The journey from York Factory to Red River involves navigating over thirty-six portages and numerous rapids. The voyage typically starts in May, proceeds to Norway House, then Portage La Loche for cargo exchange. We set off from York Factory with the brigade, starting the ascent of Hayes River. Our boat, like the others, was shallow and broad, capable of carrying nine men, cargo, and passengers. The crew's provisions included pemmican and flour, while passengers enjoyed ham, buffalo tongues, tea, and more. Pemmican, a staple food made from dried buffalo meat mixed with grease, is a reliable and durable source of sustenance for the voyageurs.|['1.

After a quick supper, we warmed ourselves by the fire and made guesses about the next day's weather. Then, we settled down on our blankets, Mr. Carles snoring loudly while I drifted off to thoughts of home. At dawn, the guide's loud call woke us all up, and we swiftly packed up and set off up Hayes River. The missionaries were efficient travelers, never slowing us down, and the boatmen slept in their work clothes under the open sky. Mornings were always chilly and gloomy, but as I got used to the routine, I learned to snooze on the boat until breakfast. Our morning meal varied depending on our arrival time at a good spot, but our first breakfast in the woods was a cheerful affair in the sunshine. We then rowed in shifts, stopping only for breakfast and a cold midday meal. Soon, we turned onto Steel River, where the strong current forced us to track the boat along the shore, a tiring task that rotated among the crew.|"[""1.

The river's high and steep banks forced the travelers to navigate carefully, sometimes near the water and other times on narrow ledges. The soft clay banks made the journey tiring, but the cheerful _voyageurs_ seemed unfazed, joking and playing tricks as they worked. Upon reaching the Rock Portage, a waterfall blocked their path, requiring them to carry everything across a flat rock. The men hustled, hauling boats and shouting to overcome the thundering water. Despite the challenges, spirits were high. The journey was filled with novel experiences, from killing a first duck to encountering a bounding black bear.

Small birds were abundant along with the larger wild-fowl. Among them, the whisky-jacks were notably curious and bold. They would eagerly gather around during breakfast, even coming within arm's reach, eyeing us comically. One man shared how he would catch them with bait. Intrigued, I tried the same, luring one to perch on my hand for crumbs. The trap sprung, causing the bird to screech and struggle ferociously. They were cheeky creatures, unafraid and impudent. They were bluish-grey, resembling blackbirds but fluffier. As we slowly navigated Hill River, facing challenges like pushing boats up rapids, the journey became easier with tranquil waters allowing oars and sails.

The weather turned stormy as the men rowed towards the shore at Norway House. Dark clouds covered the sky, and the wind picked up. The ducks left, and the whip-poor-will's song faded. Gulls circled above, crying mournfully. Raindrops fell as thunder rumbled. The men hurriedly rowed to shore as the storm approached. Once ashore, they sought shelter from the rain under oiled cloths. The tents were set up, but the fires struggled to stay lit. Drenched and cold, they reflected on the thin line between happiness and misery. Norway House, a fort on Jack River, welcomed them after a long journey from York Factory. The whitewashed houses stood in a square, hidden from the lake by rocks. A flagstaff marked the fort's location. The scene was picturesque with tents drying in the sun and people enjoying games on the grassy park. The forest behind the fort added to the serene setting of Norway House in 1841.|"['1.

From the rocks where the flagstaff stands, we saw Playgreen Lake, a serene view despite the flat, swampy land. The absence of hills didn't dim the tranquil scene, with boats gently sailing on the water. Our journey resumed with Miss Jessie Russ joining us. Camping by Lake Winnipeg, a vast body of water, we found the shores mostly flat and uneventful, save for occasional charming spots. As we sailed along, hoisting our sails to the wind, we reached the mouth of Red River after five days. The area was marshy and teeming with wildlife. Continuing upriver, passing an Indian settlement, we marveled at the cultivated fields and quaint houses. Arriving at the Stone Fort, the banks turned wooded and elevated. The Red River Settlement, an isolated oasis, nestled by Red River and Assinaboine River, thrived with a mix of French Canadians, Scots, and Indigenous peoples.|"['1.

The settlers at Red River, a colony established by Lord Selkirk in 1811, cultivate wheat, barley, and Indian corn abundantly. They face challenges in selling their surplus produce due to limited markets. The settlers keep sheep, pigs, poultry, and cattle and use carioles to travel to church. The settlement uses a paper currency, with English coins also in circulation. The Canadian settlers and half-breeds work with the Company's boats and hunt buffalo. The rivers are rich in fish like goldeyes, sturgeon, and catfish. The woods are home to wolves, bears, and other wildlife. The colony had a peaceful start, with friendly relations with the Indians. However, conflicts arose between the Hudson Bay Company and the North-West Company, resulting in a skirmish where Governor Semple lost his life.|['1.

In the past, two rival companies, the Hudson Bay and North-West Companies, were often at odds. Surprisingly, when they set up forts near each other in North America, they acted as friendly neighbors. Despite their differences, their clerks and laborers socialized, even hosting parties and balls. On one occasion, when the Hudson Bay Company spotted Indian tracks, they threw a grand ball for the North-West Company as a distraction. The Nor'-Westers later sought revenge for this trickery. In another encounter, the companies met in the woods, lit a fire, and shared stories and drinks. The Nor'-Westers slyly spilled their grog to stay sober while their rivals got drunk. They then tied up the inebriated Hudson Bay party and sent them back to their fort, securing the furs for themselves.|"[""1.

Fort Garry, the main building of the Hudson Bay Company, sits near the Assinaboine River, about two hundred yards from where it meets the Red River. It's a square stone structure with cannon openings at the corners. The main houses, stores, and offices are inside the walls, with stables a short distance away. The area is pretty and peaceful, but the flat surroundings may not appeal to those seeking grand views. The Assinaboine River flows gently in front of the fort, where thousands of goldeyes swim on sunny autumn days. The climate at Red River is pleasant, with winter starting in November and spring in April. Despite the long, cold winters, the dry frost makes it more bearable than the damp weather in Great Britain. Summer brings severe thunderstorms and hail, damaging crops and buildings. The Indian summer before winter is serene and calm, offering beautiful views of the grass, river, and wildlife.|['1.

During our days in the settlement, we enjoyed more than just shooting. Sometimes, when the weather was pleasant, we would ride our horses across the prairie until Red River and the fort faded into the horizon. Other times, we would follow the cart road through the settlement, visiting friends and neighbors. We would exchange greetings with the French settlers, smile at the half-caste girls as they passed by, their intricate beadwork and colorful designs on their clothing catching our eye. These girls were known for their beauty and skill in crafting moccasins and coats. In the autumn of 1841, the tragic death of Mr. Thomas Simpson, a discoverer attempting to find the Nor'-West Passage, stirred the colony. Some believed he had taken his own life, while others suspected foul play. As winter gave way to spring, the ice melted, signaling the departure of the Mackenzie River brigade on their annual journey. The selection of crew members for this voyage was a lively event, overseen by the seasoned guide, L'Esperance. The men, outfitted with supplies, bid farewell to their comrades and set off down Red River, their boat-songs echoing in the air. Upon reaching Norway House, perched on the shores of Playgreen Lake, they were greeted by onlookers, including Mr. Russ, who welcomed them ashore.|"['1.

A few days after my arrival, the Council decided I should spend the winter at Norway House. The next day, following their decision, I settled into the clerks' room, taking charge of the books and papers. Skipping over the autumn activities of hunting and fishing, I found myself in the midst of winter. The once bustling Norway House now sat quietly, devoid of the summer's excitement. Mr. Russ was engrossed in reading, while I wrote in the cozy office. Mr. Cumming, a seasoned man of the wild, had just arrived for Christmas. We were soon invited to a feast by Mr. Evans, the missionary, and set off to the nearby Indian village. On our journey, Mr. Cumming shared a harrowing tale of a bear encounter, highlighting the dangers of the North American wilderness.|"['1.

Mr. Cumming finished his tale as we reached the small bay, where Rossville, an Indian village, sat. From our view, the village didn't look impressive, but the parsonage and church, perched on a mound, stood out with their white walls against the dark trees. The village had about twenty houses, all home to Indians, mostly young and middle-aged men. They farmed in summer, growing potatoes and vegetables. In winter, they hunted in the woods but never strayed for long. Mr. Evans lived among them, teaching writing, arithmetic, and Christianity to the villagers and their children. They gathered for prayer and music, singing beautifully in harmony. We were welcomed into Mr. Evans' cottage, offering a view of Playgreen Lake and a feast in preparation. The schoolroom was set for a performance by the Indian children, showcasing their talents in recitation, philosophical discussion, and music, leaving everyone delighted.|"['1.

"Norway House is a remarkable post in the Indian country. The climate is dry and healthy, unlike the damp cold of Great Britain. The area is surrounded by swamps, rocks, and dense forests. At Norway House, they had fresh meat like beef, mutton, and venison, along with buffalo meat occasionally. They were well supplied with tea, sugar, butter, and bread, and the river and lake provided white-fish, sturgeon, and pike. White-fish, a delicate and delicious fish, is abundant in North American lakes. During the sunny seasons, the place is lively with traders passing through to Hudson Bay. Winter activities included white-partridge shooting and some skating. Spring brought a welcome change, melting the ice and welcoming back the boats.

During the summer, as the heat increased, the hunters killed many buffaloes for their carts. One hunter chased a calf, separating it from the herd and knocking it down with his horse. Despite the calf's attempts to flee, the hunter eventually captured it by tiring it out and bringing it back to the camp. The relentless heat and insufferable mosquitoes plagued the hunters. The mosquitoes, with their ceaseless buzzing, tormented day and night, making it unbearable. To combat them, the hunters filled their rooms with smoke and hunted them with candles before bed. Despite their efforts, the mosquitoes persisted, leading to restless nights. Additionally, a canoe adventure across Playgreen Lake provided a thrilling yet nerve-wracking experience. After a momentary scare of tipping over, the hunter safely returned to the fort under the night sky, carrying the small canoe with ease.|['1.

During warm, sunny days, when everything was calm, Mr. Russ and I used to go fishing for goldeyes. We would walk down to the water, and using grasshoppers as bait, we would cast our lines into the water. Mr. Russ, an avid angler, would get excited whenever he felt a tug on the line. One time, he caught a small goldeye that flew out of the water and landed near a young Indian boy. We caught dozens of goldeyes quickly, and Mr. Russ even tried fly-fishing with a new rod. However, he ended up catching the Indian boy's hair on his first cast. After a brief breakfast break, we continued fishing until we had caught a good number of fish.

Are you eager, reader, to live in a serene place with a view of the sea? If so, York Factory may not be the ideal spot. It's not entirely unpleasant, as I spent two happy years there, but it's described as a blot on a swampy area with a limited view of the frozen sea. First impressions can be misleading, and you might think a place like that can't be enjoyable. Let me enlighten you with a detailed description of York Factory. The main building is the general store where goods for the northern department are stored. There are houses for visitors, fur-stores, laborers' residences, and more. The climate is harsh, with a short summer plagued by extreme heat and insects. The winter is healthy due to intense cold.

In the cold climate of the Arctic region, the inhabitants wear coats and trousers made of smoked deer-skins to stay warm. Their houses are made of wood with double windows and doors, heated by large iron stoves fueled with wood. Despite this, the cold can be so intense that the stove can become red-hot and water in the room can freeze solid. The average temperature is about 15 to 16 degrees below zero, with the country being a swampy area. Summers are short with a fight between summer and winter, leading to a brief but enjoyable period in September and October. Winter arrives in November with light snowfalls and hard frost. The marshes become active with migrating ducks, and the arrival of snow-birds signals the changing seasons.

York Fort is a significant place, acting as a gateway to the wild territories around Hudson Bay. After describing its appearance, I will introduce my future friends, detailing our activities in the marshes. On a day in June 1843, I arrived at York Fort again, heading to Bachelors' Hall as directed by Mr. Grave. As I neared the house, I heard a commotion inside. Peeking in, I saw a hilarious scene. Crusty was about to drench his colleagues with water, the doctor was ready with a syringe, and the skipper was trying to stifle his laughter. When Mr. Grave unexpectedly entered, chaos ensued. The doctor hid the syringe, the wrestlers fled, and Crusty ended up soaked. The house was simple, with a large hall, basic furniture, and a central stove. Each room reflected its occupant's interests, from woodworking to surgery. Despite the lack of luxury, the house had a cozy feel with its low ceilings and small windows.|"['1.

As the winter approached, the days grew shorter, the nights frostier, and snowflakes began to fall, signaling the arrival of winter. By early October, the cold, damp, snowy weather typical of the season set in. The Hayes River filled with drifting ice, and the entire landscape was blanketed in snow. Soon after, the river froze over completely, and even Hudson Bay was covered in a layer of ice as far as the eye could see. We adjusted to winter by installing double windows and doors, adding extra blankets to our beds, and keeping the iron stove burning constantly. Our outdoor attire changed to thick leather coats, fur caps, warm socks, and moccasins. We ventured out to hunt white partridges in the snow, bundled up in layers of clothing to combat the biting cold.|"['1.

During our day in the woods, we roamed around, hunting ptarmigan and wood-partridges. While walking in the afternoon, the skipper shot a rabbit without aiming, astonishing us all. Satisfied with our full game bags, we started back but encountered more ptarmigan that wouldn't fly away. The firing was intense, and I even accidentally froze my tongue to my powder-flask handle while trying to reload in the extreme cold. As we hurried back to the fort, snowflakes fell, the sky darkened, and a distant wind forewarned a storm. The cold wind from the Arctic drove hail and snow, making our journey back challenging.

The trading-room, also known as the Indian-shop, resembled a typical store in the United States, stocked with goods for the needs of the Indians. The shelves were filled with various items like cloth, blankets, caps, and more. There were files, knives, and beads in smaller sections. Drawers held needles, pins, and scissors. The floor had copper and tin kettles, and trading guns were displayed. Trade began when an old Indian brought furs for valuation and received wooden pieces in return. He selected items like blankets and guns, paying with the wooden pieces. The Indians shopped slowly, and after a couple of hours, Mr. Wilson and the narrator returned to the house.

On Christmas morning, I woke up to the bright sun shining through the frost-covered window. My friend Crusty surprised me with a pillow fight to wish me a merry Christmas. After the playful scuffle, we planned our day. We decided to visit the men first, then have breakfast, go partridge shooting, return for dinner, and end the day with a ball at Bachelors' Hall. The festive spirit continued with a hearty Christmas dinner in the winter mess-room. The room was decorated with engravings, a mahogany table, and a polished stove. We enjoyed a feast of wild goose, roast beef, partridges, and port and Madeira wine. Mr. Grave welcomed us warmly, and we sat down to savor the delicious meal together.|"['1.

At the head of the table sat Mr. Grave, partly visible through the steam rising from the food. To his sides were the doctor and the accountant. Down the table were the skipper, four clerks, and Mr. Wilson, whose kind face shone with smiles. Laughter filled the room at York Factory. Mr. Grave calmly asked each clerk to drink with him. The clerks, feeling confident, engaged in playful antics like passing vinegar instead of salt. After the fun, Mr. Grave proposed a toast to absent friends. The mention of ladies made the men more cheerful. Soon, a fiddler's music signaled the start of a ball. The room was lit by candles, with Orkneymen, half-breeds, and Indian women in vibrant attire. The women greeted the guests, adding a unique touch to the festive atmosphere.|"['1.

During the evening, the Indian women provided amusement. They were not graceful dancers, lacking lively expressions and rapid foot movements. Their dance was slow and solemn. They appeared to enjoy themselves immensely, keeping the fiddler busy all night. Later, the tables were combined for a supper, but one end was higher than the other. The meal included cold venison, a massive kettle of tea, sugar, bread, and salt butter. The Indians relished the feast, finishing it quickly with chatter and giggles. The guests left content, especially the ladies who took leftovers in their handkerchiefs. The next morning, the walls were covered in beautiful ice crystals due to the moisture from the dance. Winter held on until May, but eventually, the ice on the river melted, creating a spectacular sight as it rushed towards Hudson Bay.|['1.

Nature in the Arctic is like a deep sleep during winter, awakening joyously in spring. Two friends, Crusty and I, got ready for spring hunting after a long winter indoors. The bright day and calm river set the scene for our adventure. We paddled our canoe, guns ready, excited for the day's hunt. As we glided down the river, the mirror-like water reflected the sky's beauty. A gull, appearing huge in the calm air, added to the surreal scene. Our guns, fully loaded, and the anticipation of a successful hunt filled us with excitement. Spotting ducks and geese, we imitated their calls to draw them near. Surprisingly, they responded, flying closer until we took our shots. After a successful hunt, we visited an old Indian named Morris, sharing a meal of soup with plover and a white owl. The day ended with full bags of game and memories of a thrilling adventure.|"['1.

After resting with a friendly man, we left to set up camp before dark, planning to spend the night under our canoe in the swamps. We came across a fox-trap on a pole used by old Morris to catch owls. The white owl is a large bird, sometimes as big as a swan. I once shot one with a wingspan of five feet three inches. They perch on tree tops to hunt for mice and birds. The Indian sets traps on bare trees to catch them. The walk back to our canoe was tiring. We found a dry spot to sleep under a willow bush. We made a fire with driftwood and roasted ducks. The night was dark, but we heard ducks flying overhead. I tried to shoot one in the dark and succeeded. We ate quickly, wrapped in blankets, and fell asleep under the canoe by the warm fire.|['1.

Quicksilver can easily freeze and has been used in bullet molds, frozen, and shot through a gun barrel. In America, the frogs in swamps sound like birds, with their constant singing often mistaken for birds. Travellers in buffalo robes are pulled by dogs on sleds, which can easily tip over on uneven ground. Boats arriving signaled the start of a busy season. An express canoe brought dispatches, causing excitement. Mr. Grave summoned Mr. Ballantyne urgently, revealing a trip to Norway House. Mr. Ballantyne shared the news with his friends, packed, and prepared to travel. The canoe to Norway House was small, carrying provisions, blankets, and cooking utensils. Mr. Ballantyne embarked with two Indians, ready for the three-hundred-mile journey.|['1.

My two companions were Swampy Crees, not the most likely choice for travel based on appearance alone. One was old, perhaps over fifty, and the other, though young, was disabled. Yet, they proved to be hardworking men. Traveling light, I carried a mosquito-net rolled up in my blanket. As we departed on June 23rd, leaving York Factory behind, a mix of emotions enveloped me. The day was fine, and thoughts of exploring North America filled my mind. The journey up the Hayes River was serene, passing icy banks and barren trees. About sixteen miles from the factory, our canoe hit a stone, causing a small hole. The Indians skillfully repaired it with bark, roots, and gum. That night, we camped by a brook, enjoying a supper of pemmican, biscuit, and tea under the moonlight.|['1.

Early the next day, we woke up between two and three in the morning and got ready to continue our journey. The morning was misty as we set off and started moving up the river again. The sun rose around six o'clock, dispersing the fog and revealing the beauty of nature once more. Despite some remaining ice along the shores, I was amazed by the lush vegetation we encountered as we traveled inland. Just thirty miles from York Factory, the trees and bushes were now adorned with vibrant green leaves, a stark contrast to the snow-covered shores of Hudson Bay. Around eight o'clock, we stopped for a quick breakfast, similar to the previous night's supper but eaten in a hurry. As we resumed our journey, we encountered a small canoe carrying a postmaster and two Indians transporting otters to York Factory. After a brief exchange, we continued our separate ways. The day became sweltering with no wind and intense heat from the sun. I tried various methods to cool down, but the relentless mosquitoes made it challenging to find relief. By evening, we reached the forks of Hayes and Steel Rivers and decided to camp for the night due to the increasing darkness and our hunger. Despite the discomfort caused by the mosquitoes, we tried to rest on the beach without a fire. The next morning, we continued our voyage, encountering a brigade of boats from Norway House.

After spending some time chatting with Kippling about the friendly people of Red River and Norway House, we left as they began cooking a hearty meal. We then reached Hill River and started our journey upstream. The landscape had changed, showing signs of spring overtaking winter. The riverbanks were lush with greenery, and spruce-fir trees added to the beauty. The men faced challenges tracking the canoe against the strong current, navigating steep banks and thick willows. Despite the difficulties, they persevered, taking turns tracking and steering. As we camped for the night, we were besieged by mosquitoes, forcing us to eat quickly in the smoky air. Determined to rest peacefully, I set up a mosquito net and enjoyed a peaceful night's sleep. The next morning, we continued our journey, encountering the first portage and a thrilling waterfall.

Upon our arrival, we found ourselves among a group from the Saskatchewan brigade heading to York Factory. I recognized two of my friends in charge and engaged in conversation about our journey. To my surprise, they had forgotten who I was due to my appearance altered by the sun and rugged attire. After dinner, one of them offered to share his tent, and we stayed up chatting late into the night. At dawn, we were awakened by the guide's call to rise, which I found quite unpleasant. The day brought challenges as we faced numerous rapids and cascades, making frequent portages. I admired how skillfully my Indian companions navigated the canoe through the rapids, carefully choosing the path to ascend each rapid. Despite the toil, we persevered, ascending the river with determination and skill, much like a salmon navigating the waters.|"[""1.

Once, during a river journey, we faced a steep two-foot waterfall. The current was strong, and the Indians with us hesitated. Despite the challenge, they decided to try ascending it. Using poles instead of paddles, we inched our way up against the powerful current. Nearly at the top, a slip caused us to drift back down. After a successful second attempt, we reached calm waters. Later, we met another group and shared stories. The serene evening brought us to a beautiful river with lush islets and wildlife. The next day, we overcame rapids and enjoyed a peaceful breakfast. A grand north canoe passed by, a sight to behold. Such canoes in a brigade are a magnificent sight, with men paddling in unison to a lively tune.

"I had a wonderful time with a friendly family, chatting about our friends and the country's affairs. While there, I noticed a tall box in a corner, which turned out to be a barrel-organ. I used to dislike barrel-organs, but living in the bush had made me appreciate music more. I played tunes like ""God Save the Queen"" and ""Rule Britannia"" on the organ, feeling nostalgic. The next morning, we set off early, and the wind forced us to camp on an island. We were visited by Indians who traded a large trout with us. I took a refreshing swim in the lake. Later, we continued our journey, meeting acquaintances on the way. I had a comical fall while trying to land, but we shared a good laugh and breakfast together.

In the woods, using the lake as a mirror, we washed our sunburnt faces. After making ourselves presentable, we swiftly paddled across the lake. As evening approached, the Wesleyan Church spire in Rossville came into view. Memories flooded back as we neared the rocks I had explored years before. Upon reaching the fort, the bustling scene indicated a recent arrival. Our canoe was initially overlooked until observers noticed an unusual figure inside. We were greeted warmly, and preparations began for an upcoming journey to Canada. Our sturdy canoe, manned by a team of eight, awaited us at the wharf. The vessel, crafted from birch bark, was light yet capable of carrying a heavy load. Our departure marked the start of a two-thousand-three-hundred-mile trek through the American wilderness. The first day was pleasant, and we camped by the river, setting up tents and enjoying a cheerful supper by the campfire.|['1.

Early the next morning, before sunrise, we were woken up to get back on the canoe, marking the true beginning of our journey. Quietly, we boarded the canoe and sat down as the men paddled up the calm river. The rising sun lifted our spirits, and after breakfast on a small island, we resumed our journey with a cheerful song. However, a sudden breeze forced us to camp near Montreal Point, delaying our progress. The following day, we faced strong winds again, leading us to shore for two days. Being wind-bound in these wild regions was frustrating, with limited activities like reading or strolling by the lake.

On the 4th of September, the group faced strong winds as they finally decided to set out on their journey despite the challenging conditions. After loading the canoe and braving the waves, they embarked towards the Winnipeg River. At Fort Alexander, a brief stop for provisions was made before resuming their voyage. The river presented new challenges with rapid waters and waterfalls that required them to carry the canoe and cargo over rocks to continue. Despite the arduous portages, the group found solace in discovering plum trees and indulging in the fresh fruit. The following day, they were greeted by the scenic beauty of the river, encountering various landscapes and even a bear along the banks. As they navigated through the river, meeting with indigenous tribes and other travelers, the group continued their expedition with enthusiasm and curiosity.|"['1.

As the sun began to set, we set up camp near a small lake at the river's edge. The forest echoed with the sounds of our merry men and the trees falling as they worked. The sun cast a red glow over the water, competing with our crackling campfire. The men rested around the fire, the cook preparing a feast of fried pork, ham, bread, and butter. We dined in silence, sipping tea, listening to the brook nearby. The men shared stories, urging Pierre to tell a tale. Pierre, a guide with jet-black eyes, shared a story of an Indian named Wapwian. He described meeting Wapwian in the Labrador coast village, where the sea-fowl soared above the majestic Gulf of St. Lawrence, creating a picturesque scene by the spruce-fir forest.|['1.

We were led to a tent on a raised area above the rest, where we relaxed on soft pine branches, chatting with our friend Wapwian while his wife cooked fish. We enjoyed two days hunting and fishing with the villagers. On the third day, Wapwian and his nephew set out to hunt ducks. As they ventured into the forest, a bear appeared. Wapwian shot, but the bear attacked, injuring him severely. His nephew bravely fought the bear until it retreated. The nephew rushed back to the village for help. Sadly, it was too late. Wapwian succumbed to his injuries, leaving his wife grief-stricken. The village mourned the loss of the brave hunter.|"['1.

The guide stopped and glanced at his listeners. Unfortunately, half of them had drifted off to sleep, and Baptiste, the intended audience, was sprawled on the grass, his head on an old tree stump, a pipe dangling from his mouth. With a sigh, the guide shook his pipe, wrapped himself in his blanket, and lay down. The next day, we packed up and continued our journey through more rugged, scenic terrain. Tall pines grew abundantly, and the rushing river cast shadows as we struggled to move forward. Sometimes we navigated the rapids with paddles or poles, and when those failed, we used a tracking line. We made several portages, carrying our canoe and cargo. Eventually, we reached Rat Portage House, where we were warmly received. The following day, we paddled across Lac du Bois, marveling at its beauty. The serene lakes and wooded isles reminded us of nature's wonders. At night, we camped under the stars, enjoying our meal by the crackling fire. The next morning, we began our ascent of Lac la Pluie River, a picturesque waterway reminiscent of English landscapes. We stopped for lunch on a rock by the riverbank, shaded by trees and bathed in sunlight. After a hearty meal, we resumed our journey, appreciating the beauty of the river's lush surroundings.|"[""1.

On the evening of the next day, we reached Fort Frances, an old fort by a river's bend near a waterfall. The chief trader there, with only a few workers, welcomed us warmly. Our men carried our canoe over the portage to avoid the waterfall. We stayed the night at the fort, sleeping on the floor with a buffalo robe. The next morning, we crossed Lac la Pluie with a fair breeze, a stroke of luck. Our journey continued with portages and lakes, sometimes challenging due to shallow waters. As we prepared to ascend the Mecan River, we encountered an Indian father and son fishing. The father's wild appearance intrigued us. Their tent, made of birch bark, revealed their simple lifestyle. The inside was smoky and cluttered, with the family engaged in various activities.|"['1.

Our journey through the rugged wilderness was filled with unexpected challenges and adventures. As we paddled our canoe through narrow rivers and vast lakes, we encountered portages and treacherous waters. One frosty morning, I found myself stranded in a reedy lake, far from shore, after the canoe left me behind. With cold water soaking my knees, I made my way through thorns and bushes to reunite with the canoe. Our travels took us through various water bodies like Mecan River, Cross Lake, and Sturgeon Lake, each presenting its own set of obstacles. In the past, the North-West Company's canoes used to traverse these routes, creating a lively and bustling atmosphere with their vibrant songs and energetic paddling. Today, the echoes of their journeys have faded, leaving behind only memories of a bygone era.|"['1.

On Saturday, September 20th, we journeyed across Prairie Portage in the morning, covering a distance of about three to four miles. After breakfast, I sketched the picturesque scenery from a nearby hill. Passing through two more portages and small lakes, we set sail on the Du Chien River, descending for the first time after crossing the height of land. We encountered grey grouse and one was caught by our companion, Baptiste, in a unique manner. The birds were tame, allowing us to approach closely. Baptiste cleverly caught one for supper using a noose on a branch. On Sunday, the 21st, we crossed Lac du Chien and enjoyed a breathtaking view of the surrounding country after making the portage of the same name. The journey continued down the Kamenistaquoia River, where we pitched our tents after another portage. Rain on Monday forced us ashore, making travel miserable. Despite the challenges, we resumed our journey after the rain stopped. On Tuesday, we navigated through shallow waters, crossing numerous portages and running thrilling rapids. The men skillfully guided the canoe through the turbulent waters, showcasing their expertise and teamwork. Accidents were not uncommon, emphasizing the dangers and excitement of navigating rapids.

In the evening, we camped close to Fort William after losing a crew member who went ashore to lighten the canoe while navigating a rapid. After a search, we found him too late to reach the fort that night. The next morning, we set off early and soon caught sight of Fort William reflected in Lake Superior's clear waters. The fort, once a major post in the Indian country, now shows signs of decline, with many buildings torn down or in poor condition. Despite this, it remains a vital fishing spot where white-fish and large trout are caught in abundance. The area boasts stunning scenery, with flat lands surrounding the fort, giving way to mountains in the distance and the vast Lake Superior with its rocky islands. We spent the day at the fort, resting and repairing our canoe before continuing our journey along the lake's northern shore.|"['1.

The next morning, we said goodbye to the kind folks at Fort William and started our journey along the northern coast of Lake Superior, a vast body of water over three hundred miles wide. The weather was pleasant as we set out, but luck was not on our side that day. A calm day turned into a turbulent one as dark clouds loomed, and the waves grew fierce. Battling through the rough waters, we made our way towards a small island for safety. After a challenging voyage, we reached the island, damp and a bit shaken. We set up camp, dried off, and found comfort despite the storm. The island was rocky and covered in shrubs, where we stumbled upon an Indigenous family who kindly shared a delicious white-fish with us. Despite the stormy weather, we persevered and eventually continued our journey, facing more challenges but also finding moments of laughter and camaraderie along the way.|['1.

After a mysterious sleep, I awoke to the sound of paddles and a sky filled with dazzling stars. The scene was breathtaking, with towering cliffs on our left and eerie calm on the lake. Islands of strange shapes surrounded us, shrouded in mist. The guide's whisper broke the silence as we landed on a stony beach to rest. We continued our journey through narrow passages and rocky shores, camping in darkness without a fire. Traveling day and night, we reached Sault de Ste. Marie, a significant rapid between two countries. Our adventure continued, passing through lakes and rivers, encountering a tragic site of wooden crosses marking a lost canoe. A surprising find of bears' grease provided a feast for our tired crew. Amidst perilous waters, a near disaster at a waterfall was narrowly averted by skilled paddlers.|['1.

On the 19th of October, we started our descent down the stunning Ottawa River, feeling closer to civilization. Passing log-huts of timber cutters and encountering adventurous pioneers in canoes, we reached Fort Mattawan by evening. Camping with a party supplying provisions to wood-cutters, we enjoyed the beautiful scenery along the Ottawa, occasionally spotting farmhouses. Despite the few opportunities to interact with locals, the sight of Aylmer village brought immense joy after our wilderness journey. The village, with its church spire and white houses, felt like a dream. The encounter with a fellow voyageur added to the excitement. Later, we reached Lachine, marking the end of our 66-day wilderness journey. Winter set in, introducing us to the local culture of sleigh rides and the enchanting sound of bells on the snowy Canadian roads.|"['1.

Dear reader, I was almost ready to tell you all about Canada and its people, the Canadians. However, I hesitate to do so as I fear I may encroach on the territory of more sophisticated writers. My expertise lies in describing the life of the indigenous people, and I hope you'll forgive me for abruptly ending this chapter. It's often said that just when happiness is within reach, it slips away. I've experienced this myself. The happiness I anticipated was the joy of civilized society, but it was snatched away when I was suddenly sent to a remote station I knew nothing about. Many years have passed since then, and Dr. Rae has become renowned for his discoveries and searches for Sir John Franklin. One bright winter day in January 1846, I was summoned by the Governor and informed that I would be leaving early the next morning for Tadousac with Mr. Stone. Tadousac is a station at the mouth of the Saguenay River, about 300 miles from Montreal. From there, we would travel 200 miles further to Seven Islands. The journey is long and mostly through uninhabited areas with rough travel conditions. The next morning, our departure was delayed, and I used the time to prepare in Montreal. The sleigh ride commenced with the stars shining brightly, and we glided through the snow-covered landscape. The journey was not without its challenges, with unexpected dips in the road causing rough rides. Despite the bumps, we continued on|"['1.

The morning was clear and warm as we got back into the sleigh, feeling happy and ready to enjoy the picturesque scenery passing by. The hills and valleys, covered in snow and dark pines, created a beautiful backdrop. We saw hamlets and villages bustling with activity, children playing, and families heading to markets or celebrations. Despite some sleigh upsets, we continued merrily along the roads. Upon reaching Quebec, the fortifications and views from the ramparts were impressive. The steep streets of the town required effort to climb, and the town itself was not very pretty in winter. However, the suburban villas and Falls of Montmorenci offered glimpses of beauty. As we journeyed further, the landscape became more rugged, with fewer signs of civilization. Meeting friendly Canadians along the way added joy to our adventure.|"['1.

As the day drew to a close, our driver informed us that we were nearing Baie de St. Paul. After a half-hour journey, our tired horse led us to a hilltop, offering a breathtaking view of the village. The Vale of Baie de St. Paul was unlike anything I had seen before in all my travels. The valley stretched for miles, adorned with countless hamlets, churches, and pockets of forest. A meandering rivulet was visible, even under a blanket of snow. Schooners and vessels lay frozen at the mouth of the river, with the icy waves of the Gulf of St. Lawrence beyond. The valley bustled with life as Canadians zipped around in sleighs and carioles, their bells faintly ringing through the calm air.

Tadousac Bay is a deep natural harbor in the St. Lawrence. Many vessels frequent the bay, including ships, schooners, barks, brigs, and bateaux. Some ships anchor close to the shore, while others attempt to enter the harbor. Pilot boats sail nearby, and in the distance, hundreds of vessels with white sails can be seen. The view is completed by hills on the opposite shore blending with the sky. The land around Tadousac is wild and mountainous, inhabited by a few Indians and wild animals. Mr. Stone, a kind man, oversees a timber-cutting establishment nearby. Once, Mr. Stone was attacked by an Indian who stole his horse. Despite being outnumbered, Mr. Stone's colleagues rescued him before any serious harm was done, leaving him with a scar on his nose.|"['1.

In the winter at Tadousac, I shared an office and bedroom with Mr. Jordan, a half-breed clerk who spent more time with Indians than with civilized people. He led a lively life trading with natives and hunting seals. Jordan and his men would ambush seals on the shore by the St. Lawrence River, where a comic and tragic scene of slaughter unfolded. The winter confined us indoors, except for the occasional excitement of the barrel-organ playing psalm tunes and Scottish reels. As March approached, I prepared to journey sixty miles to Isle Jeremie. The cold, frosty winter landscape of Tadousac, with its icy shores and snow-covered land, awaited my snow-shoe trek down the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Despite the bleak outlook, I faced the journey with philosophical acceptance, discussing it over breakfast with Mr. Stone.|"['1.

One time, he embarked on a lengthy trip across the snowy terrain. The mountainous region made snowshoe walking challenging, especially when descending hills as his feet slid forward against the front bar of the shoe. Despite enduring blisters and losing his toenails, he continued the journey, fearing being stranded in the woods. Each morning, he tied the nails to protect the tender parts underneath and stored them in his pocket at night to prevent losing them. Departing from Tadousac with snowshoes, he boarded a boat with a Roman Catholic priest and a companion. The cold, desolate scenery along the Gulf of St. Lawrence on a wintry day was bleak. The journey continued to Esquimain River, where they spent the night in a log-hut. The next day, they prepared for the march, facing challenges due to the thawing weather, making the snow heavy and sticky.

My guide, Bezeau, a French Canadian, wore a rough blue shirt and corduroy pants held up by a bright red belt. He also had on blue leggings with orange ribbons, a Glengarry bonnet, and seal-skin shoes. I was dressed in a red flannel shirt, local trousers, and deer-skin moccasins, with a hunting knife hanging from a leather belt. We carried our provisions, blankets, and a tea kettle, armed only with a small axe and knife. Setting off from Esquimain River, we aimed to reach Isle Jeremie, though neither of us had been that way before. The journey was through uninhabited land, passing an outpost and a saw-mill. The sun shone as we walked, but the melting snow made it tough. After resting at an Indian hut, we encountered a shipwreck, a somber sight on the wintry shore.|['1.

We rested by a warm fire, drying our wet shoes and socks while enjoying a cup of tea. The tea refreshed us, and we continued our journey in better spirits, pretending it was a pleasant walk. However, exhaustion soon set in as we trudged along the coast. Feeling weak, we stopped to rest on a lump of ice, which was a mistake without a fire. After a cup of tea by a blazing fire, we felt rejuvenated and decided to push on towards Port Neuf. Despite walking until midnight, we couldn't find the post. We decided to camp for the night in a cozy spot among willow and pine trees. We cleared snow, made a fire, and had a comforting supper. The next morning brought rain, making the journey even more challenging. Stiff and sore, we finally reached Port Neuf after enduring a difficult five-mile walk.|['1.

On the 16th, the weather turned colder, and Bezeau suggested we continue our journey. Excited to be on the move again and worried about being stranded by the spring, I strapped on my snow-shoes. Leaving the kind folks at Port Neuf behind, we trudged along the coast. Unfortunately, our troubles weren't over. The snow was softer than expected, reopening blisters on my feet. After a challenging walk, we found a small house where men had set up a saw-mill. To our relief, we discovered a small boat that could fit a few of us. We quickly loaded our gear, jumped in, and rowed along the coast. The ice forced us to row out to sea to avoid it, but we soon realized we were drifting away with the ice. Panicked, we rowed back to shore, hauled the boat out, and continued on foot. Finally, after a long journey, we spotted signs of civilization and reached Isle Jeremie, where we rested and prepared for the next leg of our adventure.|['1.

When did the St. Lawrence River become friendly for an entire journey? Definitely not when I had the pleasure of sailing its tricky waters! The rest of our trip was a series of storms, calm winds, sailing against the wind, getting stuck on shallow areas for hours, and being delayed on land, all while dealing with rocking, tossing, swaying, and trouble that's hard to describe. But time eventually brought our greatest troubles to an end, and we finally reached Tadousac. There, we loaded our boat with flour, said goodbye to our friends, shared our adventures, bid them farewell, and set off down the St. Lawrence River again with a strong breeze at our backs. This was a much better situation compared to our tough journey up the river. Wrapped in our blankets due to the cold, we were pleased with our luck. However, our relief was short-lived. We had a close call with almost being swamped, as a sudden squall hit us while we sailed towards Isle Jeremie.|"['1.

One sunny afternoon in mid-April, I lounged on the veranda at Isle Jeremie, watching ice fields drift down the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Mr. Coral then informed me I was to travel to Seven Islands, 120 miles away, to relieve another. The next morning, I set off in a canoe with a Canadian steersman, a Patlander, and Humbug the dog. We faced stormy weather, risking capsizing, and had meals and rest in the forest. After a stop at Goodbout, we had to wait out a storm before continuing. On the third day, I became the steersman, and we reached Pointe des Monts, where we spent the night in a lighthouse. The following morning, we found an Indian boat heading to Seven Islands, and we secured passage by offering tobacco. The boat was crowded with the Indian's family, including a comical elderly mother who would hide below deck at the slightest breeze.|"[""1.

After the usual storms and contrary winds, we reached Seven Islands. I surprised Mr. Anderson by revealing I was his successor. The post at Seven Islands, though pretty on clear days, looks lonely and wild. The houses sit on a sandy beach at the bay's base. Sparse trees and rugged hills surround it, with seven islands blocking the sea view. No homes exist within seventy miles, and few vessels visit due to its remote location. Walking to the Moisie River, we saw loons and black ducks. At the river, we found a salmon fishery where the catch was salted. The next day, we explored the river's fisheries, encountering seals and enjoying the lush scenery. We slept in fishing cabins, even using nets as makeshift bedding. Despite challenges like seals and bears, the journey was an adventure.|"['1.

While examining the nets, we observed a seal-hunt unfold. Two Native Americans in separate canoes quietly waited in an eddy, guns at the ready. A seal surfaced, and one of the hunters took a shot, injuring it. The seal dived, and the hunter reloaded, preparing for another shot when it resurfaced. After a short time, the seal emerged again, and the second shot appeared to render it lifeless. The hunter paddled towards the seal, but it revived and dived, causing the hunter to capsize. Eventually, the seal succumbed, and the hunter secured his catch. Later, we returned to the fishery, had supper, and decided to walk to the post due to mosquitoes. The night was dark, the waves boomed, creating a romantic atmosphere. After a long walk, we reached Seven Islands. Subsequently, my companion left for Tadousac, leaving me feeling lonely. A group of Indians arrived, trading furs, which helped alleviate my solitude. One of the Indians passed away, and they requested planks to construct a coffin for him, burying him with a simple wooden cross.|['1.

The lack of religion among the indigenous people in North America is saddening. The name of Jesus Christ is unfamiliar to the hundreds of Indians residing in the vast forests. It is surprising that fewer missionaries have been sent to the northern regions compared to the southern parts. There are only a few Protestant clergymen across the vast northern continent. The North American Indians are skilled at navigating the wilderness, even in winter, without compasses. They can determine the cardinal points by observing the thickness of tree bark. Despite the challenges of solitude, there are moments of unexpected encounters, like meeting a trapper who was a white man married to an Indian woman. His philosophical conversations provided a unique perspective on life.|"['1.

As he spoke, I walked to the water's edge and was surprised to see that what I thought was seaweed was actually a dense group of fish called kippling. I remembered seeing some old hand-nets in a nearby store and sent for them. In no time, the trapper's son, a twelve-year-old boy, brought them to us. We rolled up our pants, waded into the water, and scooped out dozens of fish. It was a challenge to catch them as they darted away quickly, making us chase them into deeper water, soaking ourselves. The excitement grew, and we didn't mind getting wet. After an hour, we headed back home with a load of kippling, drenched to the bone. I convinced the trapper to stay with me for the week, and we had a great time exploring nature and sharing stories. One tale he told was about a humorous bear-hunting incident on the coast of Labrador.

The final journey was quite challenging. The author embarked on this last voyage after bidding farewell to a trapper friend. Accompanied by five men in an open boat, they set sail for Tadousac. Nature seemed aware that it was their final journey, subjecting them to harsh weather conditions. The men, all French Canadians, rowed tirelessly against the wind. The boat lacked proper shelter, with only blankets to shield them from the elements. The nights were spent huddled around a fire on the beach, with damp clothes and scarce firewood adding to their discomfort. On the last day, as they approached the mouth of the river Saguenay, the strong current forced them to run ashore, where they struggled to keep the boat afloat. Despite the challenges, they eventually reached Tadousac, concluding their memorable but arduous voyage.|"[""1.
