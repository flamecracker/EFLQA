"At that moment, the boys were overcome with laughter; even the usually serious Frank was flushed and gasping for breath, and Jack was lying back, weakly squealing, unable to contain his mirth any longer. Suddenly, Ralph's demeanor changed, becoming as calm as a Quaker, glancing around with a mildly puzzled expression, as if questioning the reason behind the uproarious laughter. A knock on the door brought a pause, and a maid entered with apples. ""Time's up; relax and make yourselves at ease,"" the club was freed from their serious tasks and allowed to unwind for a social half-hour, mostly spent playing whist and ending with an Indian war-dance. While Jack was energetically moving about on his crutches, Jill was enduring the effects of her second fall, being instructed to lie on a hard board for two hours daily. It was a challenging penance as the board was uncomfortable, preventing her from reading without strain. The little martyr spent the first hour sobbing but transitioned to singing cheerfully, which comforted her mother and Mrs. Minot. Jack, admiringly, suggested they play a game where Jill was an Indian captive enduring torment without complaint. As Jill sang a merry tune, everyone joined in, transforming the tearful hour into one filled with music and laughter, providing a pleasant thought for the future.

"Not sleeping, but lying with her eyes fixed on the sunny window, beyond which the bright winter world sparkled after a fresh snowfall. The jingle of sleigh bells could be heard, the laughter of boys and girls on their way to school, all the pleasant stir of a new day of happy work and play for the rest of the world, more lonely, quiet, and wearisome than ever to her since her friend and fellow-prisoner was set free and going to leave her.

""The Prince is light, so the Princess must be darkish. We should choose the girl who will look best, as it is a picture.

""I choose that one, for Juliet wants to be Queen, Molly would make faces, and the others are too big or too light,"" Jill declared, pointing to Merry, who looked pleased. Mabel's face darkened, and Susy gave a disdainful sniff.

""You can use your own dress. I don't see why you should have everything,"" replied Susy, who was at the mirror, putting a wreath of scarlet flowers on her red head, determined to be cheerful since she couldn't be pretty.

""I think you are a set of cross, selfish girls to back out and keep your nice things just because you can't all have the best part. I'm ashamed of you!"" scolded Molly, standing by Merry, who was sadly surveying her mother's old purple silk, which looked like brown in the evening.

Frank and Jack were brothers, with Frank admiring Jack's good-natured and determined spirit. Jack, despite his eagerness to help others, found himself in a predicament where his hard work did not uncover a mystery as expected. With Jill's assistance, Jack toiled tirelessly to pay off a debt, sacrificing his gold coin in the process. Jill, curious about the secret, observed Jack's tired demeanor after a long and mysterious absence. Eventually, Jack's worn-out state led him to fall asleep, revealing a name in his sleep that caught Jill's attention. Meanwhile, at school, Mr. Acton addressed the students about a rule forbidding visits to a saloon, highlighting the consequences of breaking it.

Mr. Acton paused, seeming to struggle to continue, and the students exchanged questioning looks. Their teacher rarely punished, so when he did, it carried great weight. Many worried glances landed on Joe, who sat nervously whittling a pencil, avoiding eye contact. The unexpected sight of Jack Minot walking down the aisle, glaring at Joe, caused a stir. Mr. Acton addressed Jack gently, suspecting a misunderstanding. Jack, red-faced, admitted to breaking a rule to help a friend. Despite Jack's honesty, consequences were inevitable. He lost recess for a week and his behavior mark would suffer. As the bell rang, Jack left, feeling disgraced. His brother, Frank, scolded him on the way home, seeking the truth. At tea, tension lingered, with both boys silent. Mrs. Minot sensed trouble but waited for them to open up. Jack, defiant, retreated to his room, while Frank confided in their mother, revealing the whole incident. Mrs. Minot, surprised but understanding, hoped to resolve the issue.|['1.

Mrs. Minot comforted Frank by reminding him that all boys make mistakes, even the wisest ones, and that Jack must have earned the money to make amends for his misstep. Frank, feeling remorseful, sought solace in talking to Gus, leaving Jill curious about the situation. Jill, showing loyalty to Jack, decided not to add to his troubles by discussing it further. Snow-ball's affectionate gesture towards Jack's slippers indicated his loyalty too. Jack, torn between his mother's trust and his promise of silence, kept the story to himself, while Jill, through their games, silently conveyed her trust in him. At school, Jack faced teasing and distrust, especially with his upcoming report likely to be marred by recent events. Jill, determined to clear Jack's name, hoped Ed's return would shed light on the situation before the reports were issued.|"['1.
