The old lodge where the two boys found refuge was a large building made of logs with several wings, piazzas, and a woodshed nearby. Two well-dressed men, likely from the city, sat by a fireplace with hunting gear but no game. As a storm approached, the boys sought shelter in the shed, waiting until the sun reappeared. They checked the lake for the men but found no sign. Returning to their boat, they noticed trees struck by lightning. Ned headed home, while Joe rowed back, unaware of the disaster awaiting him. Upon reaching his cabin, Joe was shocked to find it crushed by a fallen tree struck by lightning, leaving him feeling desolate.|['1.

The young boy dropped his fishing gear and rushed to the cabin's front, finding it in ruins. He knelt down and heard a faint groan from the back. Quickly, he made the hermit comfortable and raced to the doctor's house. Despite his fatigue, he reached the physician's home promptly. The doctor informed him that the hermit's condition was critical. Days later, the hermit was buried with few attendees, Joe being the chief mourner. Joe and a friend searched the cabin wreckage for a missing blue box but found nothing. Feeling desolate, Joe continued his search the next day, even catching fish for supper. He sought a Hebrew peddler named Jasok for help, visiting a nearby house to inquire about him.|"[""1.

After a lengthy discussion, the Hebrew merchant agreed to pay Joe seven dollars and a half. In return, Joe had to assist in carrying the goods to the main road. By nightfall, all the items were loaded onto the wagon, leaving Joe with only the clothes on his back but thirty dollars in his pocket. The next morning, Joe set out from the cabin with his remaining belongings, including the precious thirty dollars. He opted not to visit the high-end clothing store in Riverside due to his limited funds. Instead, he chose a more modest shop.

When the party arrived at the hotel, there was a buzz of excitement. Mabel rushed to change into dry clothes, while Joe was sent to the kitchen.

I agreed to take part in a plan for mining shares, expecting it to be easy. Caven shared details about a demand for certain shares. An ill miner wanted to sell his shares for a fair price. The idea was to buy and then sell them to a broker at a higher price. Caven introduced me to a broker who seemed trustworthy and interested in the shares. I agreed to split the profits with Caven. However, when I went to meet Caven the next day, he vanished. I later found out the shares were nearly worthless. Caven and the broker had disappeared. I tried to track them down but with no luck. We discussed the situation for an hour, but the search for clues in the empty room yielded nothing. I shared that I had moved around looking for work, finally settling in this town.

Joe had grown accustomed to traveling and no longer felt inexperienced. He secured a sleeping spot and relaxed until bedtime. Upon reaching Chicago, he promptly obtained tickets for Golden Pass, Idaho. Unaware of being observed, Joe encountered Gaff Caven at the hotel ticket office. The train was sparsely populated, and Caven and Malone stuck to the smoking and dining cars initially. As night fell, the porter converted berths back into seats. Joe glimpsed daylight and checked his watch. Upon reaching Leadington, a telegram was dispatched to Snapwood. The train paused briefly, finding no passengers due to the absence of staff. Joe spent the journey quietly, observing workers clearing trees from the tracks. He remained silent as two trains passed each other. He skillfully retrieved a satchel from a tree and witnessed a confrontation between Caven and Bill Badger.|['Question 1:\nWhat did Joe do upon reaching Chicago?\nA) Obtained tickets for Golden Pass, Idaho\nB) Secured a sleeping spot\nC) Checked his watch\nD) Dispatched a telegram to Snapwood\nE) Witnessed a confrontation between Caven and Badger', 'Question 2:\nWho did Joe encounter at the hotel ticket office in Chicago?\nA) Gaff Caven\nB) Malone\nC) Badger\nD) Snapwood\nE) The porter', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Joe observe workers doing during the journey?\nA) Clearing trees from the tracks\nB) Securing sleeping spots\nC) Obtaining tickets for Golden Pass, Idaho\nD) Dispatching telegrams to Snapwood\nE) Witnessing confrontations between passengers', 'Question 4:\nWhere did Caven and Malone initially spend their time on the train?\nA) Smoking and dining cars\nB) Sleeping spots\nC) Berths\nD) Ticket office\nE) Leadington', 'Question 5:\nWhat did Joe do as two trains passed each other?\nA) Remained silent\nB) Obtained tickets for Golden Pass, Idaho\nC) Witnessed a confrontation between Caven and Badger\nD) Dispatched a telegram to Snapwood\nE) Checked his watch', 'Question 6:\nWhat did Joe witness between Caven and Bill Badger?\nA) A confrontation\nB) A conversation\nC) A collaboration\nD) A journey\nE) A telegram dispatch']|['A) Obtained tickets for Golden Pass, Idaho', 'A) Gaff Caven', 'A) Clearing trees from the tracks', 'A) Smoking and dining cars', 'A) Remained silent', 'A) A confrontation']
Joe and Bill Badger, drenched by the rain, decided to head for the nearest farmhouse or village. Following the railroad tracks, they reached a shanty where they met a track-walker. Continuing their journey, they soon arrived at a small village where they found a tavern to dry their clothes and enjoy a hot meal. Feeling refreshed, they discussed their adventures with Maurice Vane at a hotel. Vane assured them that with Caven and Malone gone, there would likely be no further trouble at the mine. Suddenly, a man named Bill Butts appeared, revealing he had been misled about Joe's demise. Butts shared his own tale of loss and redemption, inviting Joe to discuss further at his mine in the mountains.|"['1.
