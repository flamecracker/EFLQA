Later, while smoking a water-pipe under the moonlight, Kim engaged in theological discussions with the cultivator's family and a venerable lama.

As they approached the rest stop, the crowd thickened, marking the end of their journey for the day. Stalls selling simple food and tobacco, firewood, a police station, a well, a horse-trough, a few trees, and trampled ground with black ashes denoted a _parao_ on the Grand Trunk. The sun cast golden rays through the mango trees as parakeets and doves returned home. The Seven Sisters chattered, and bats prepared for the night. The light faded, and the night brought a blue haze and scents of wood smoke and cattle. The police station's evening patrol rushed out with coughs and orders. Amid this bustle, Kim embraced the disorderly life of the _parao_, where he found all he needed. With the lama's acceptance of any food, Kim bought dung-cakes for a fire. Men clamored for oil, grain, and tobacco while women giggled behind shuttered carts.

From the curtains, harsh words were hurled, striking the carter with surprise. The voice, sharp and cutting, revealed the true nature of Kim's wife and her actions in his absence.

At midday, they took a break to eat a satisfying meal served on clean leaf plates. The leftovers were given to beggars. The old lady joined the conversation, comparing different regions and sharing stories. She even criticized the tobacco she was smoking.

The lama realized that the boy was of a high rank, like the man who kept the images in the Wonder House. The lama felt confused by the customs of the white men. He feared the boy would be taken from him to become a Sahib. Kim, feeling sorry for the lama's distress, offered to leave quietly and search for the River they sought. Father Victor, observing the lama closely, understood the dilemma. He knew the lama couldn't take the boy but also couldn't leave him.

The lama dismissed Kim's idea of leaving early, emphasizing that it's not wrong to pay for learning. He believed helping the ignorant gain wisdom is always commendable. The lama then faced those opposing him, indicating that the best education in India is at St. Xavier's in Lucknow. Father Victor explained in English that the Regiment or the Punjab Masonic Orphanage could provide for Kim's education. The lama left abruptly, causing a stir among the padres. Kim stayed behind, feeling indifferent to the situation. The padres conversed excitedly, discussing plans. Kim, feeling drowsy, answered their questions truthfully. Eventually, he was placed under the supervision of a sergeant to ensure he didn't escape. The Regiment proceeded to Umballa, and Kim was to be sent to Sanawar for education. Father Victor expressed amazement at the lama's departure, unsure if he intended to fund Kim's education or had other intentions.

In the morning, as the white tents were being taken down, the Mavericks set off towards Umballa, following a side-road.

Kim did not believe a word the drummer-boy said about Liverpool, England. The time passed slowly until dinner, a disappointing meal served to the boys and a few sick people in a corner of the barracks. Kim felt lonely among the white men, unlike the indifference of the native crowds he was used to. In the afternoon, a soldier took him to Father Victor, who was reading a letter in purple ink. The priest was puzzled by the content and asked Kim for help in understanding it. The letter mentioned education being a great blessing and requested financial support for a boy's education.

The Colonel and his friend discussed plans for the boy, Kim, who was to be handed over for a specific purpose. The friend, an ethnologist, found Kim's transformation into following a symbol fascinating.

In the afternoon, the schoolmaster informed Kim that he was no longer part of the school. Confused, Kim was told to leave and play. He hurried to the market to find the young letter-writer he owed a stamp to. Kim quickly dictated a letter to the writer, addressed to Teshoo Lama, a holy man in Benares. He also mentioned his upcoming move to a school in Nucklao called Xavier. Later, Kim realized he forgot the schoolmaster's cheroot-case and promised to return it. Curious about the angry-faced Sahib who lost the case, Kim learned he was known for buying horses he couldn't ride and asking peculiar questions. Intrigued by the mystery surrounding the Sahib, Kim speculated that the man might have connections to the Commander-in-Chief. This led Kim to believe that there was more to the Sahib than met the eye, prompting him to ponder on the complexities of the situation.|"['1.

Kim was pleased that he had kept the Colonel's house secret. Returning to barracks, he found no cheroot-case left behind, which made him happy. He admired the Colonel's indirect ways and decided to play along. Father Victor introduced him to new Gods and a Goddess named Mary. He showed no emotion when buying new clothes or when teased by other boys. Father Victor accompanied him to the station, ensuring his safe journey to St. Xavier's. The Colonel advised Kim to work hard and join the Survey of India. Kim pondered his identity on the train, realizing he was just one person in the vast country.

Kim, the young boy, found himself at Lucknow station without the lama. Disappointed but determined, Kim was sent alone to St. Xavier‚Äôs school by the Colonel. As he rode through the vibrant city, Kim marveled at Lucknow's beauty and richness. Despite a driver's rudeness, Kim corrected him politely. Upon reaching the school, the driver remarked on Kim's devilish nature, to which Kim replied with a smile. Just then, the lama, who had been waiting for a day and a half, appeared.

"The school was deserted; most teachers had left. Kim felt proud that he hadn't squandered Colonel Creighton's or Mahbub's money. He still had control over two rupees seven annas.

One Sahib used a faquir's buck's horn as a weapon, causing bloodshed. Mahbub explained that the incident was a criminal case, not madness, and predicted a ten-year jail sentence for the Sahibs. Kim, familiar with bloodshed, knew that jail was the likely outcome as the Sahibs would use false names to evade capture. They quickly packed up and headed to Simla on horseback. Along the way, they encountered many Sahibs who stopped to inspect their horses, showcasing their ignorance and insulting behavior. Mahbub shared his experiences with dealing with Sahibs, highlighting their foolishness in certain matters. Despite their wisdom in some areas, using the wrong word could lead to dangerous misunderstandings.|"['1.

In the bustling bazaar of lower Simla, Kim and Mahbub Ali arrived after their adventurous journey. The narrow alleys and hidden corners of the town offered a safe haven for those in the know, away from prying eyes. Kim marveled at the city of Simla, a place where he could disappear if needed. The vibrant streets were filled with a mix of people - from jhampanis to priests, pickpockets to government employees. Mahbub Ali secured a room in the house of a Mohammedan cattle-dealer, a place where transformations seemed to occur. As the sun set, a Muslim horseboy entered, and an hour later, a Eurasian boy emerged, his disguise flawless. The journey had been arduous but filled with wonder, and Kim's heart sang with the beauty of Hind as they settled into the heart of Simla.|"['1.

Kim observed the fading sunlight in the courtyard and played with his ghost-dagger and rosary. The bustling sounds of Benares, the oldest city, encircled the walls like the sea's constant roar.

The lama and Kim traveled through valleys and mountains, following a wind-blown umbrella guiding them towards a camp of Tibetans selling ointments and powders. The lama reminisced about the Lord's silence on the world's eternity while they navigated snowy passes and grassy meadows. They marveled at the majestic hills, the eternal snow, and the vast valleys below. Meanwhile, Hurree Babu, an efficient stalker, observed their movements from afar using binoculars. He ingratiated himself with two foreigners in a leaky hut during a thunderstorm, convincing their baggage-coolies to halt travel. The coolies, familiar with rifles and Sahibs, sought refuge in the forest, refusing to continue their journey. Hurree Babu, posing as an agent for a Hill Rajah, attempted to secure a welcome from the foreigners.|"['Question 1: What guided the lama and Kim through valleys and mountains?\nA) A map\nB) A compass\nC) A wind-blown umbrella\nD) A torch\nE) A watch', 'Question 2: What were the Tibetans selling at their camp?\nA) Jewelry\nB) Carpets\nC) Ointments and powders\nD) Spices\nE) Clothing', ""Question 3: What did the lama reminisce about while traveling through snowy passes and grassy meadows?\nA) The world's chaos\nB) The Lord's silence on the world's eternity\nC) The importance of speed\nD) The beauty of nature\nE) The need for rest"", 'Question 4: Who observed the movements of the lama and Kim from afar using binoculars?\nA) Hurree Babu\nB) The coolies\nC) The Tibetans\nD) The Lord\nE) The foreigners', 'Question 5: How did Hurree Babu convince the baggage-coolies to halt their travel?\nA) By offering them money\nB) By threatening them\nC) By promising them a better job\nD) By showing them a map\nE) By ingratiating himself with two foreigners', 'Question 6: What did Hurree Babu pretend to be in order to secure a welcome from the foreigners?\nA) A doctor\nB) A soldier\nC) A spy\nD) A merchant\nE) An artist']"|"['C) A wind-blown umbrella', 'C) Ointments and powders', ""B) The Lord's silence on the world's eternity"", 'A) Hurree Babu', 'E) By ingratiating himself with two foreigners', 'C) A spy']"
The men were pleased. One was French, the other Russian, but their English was almost as good as the Babu's. They asked for help as their local helpers were sick in Leh. They rushed to bring their hunt spoils to Simla before they got ruined. They had a letter to meet all government officials. They hadn't met other hunting groups. They managed on their own with plenty of supplies. They wanted to move on quickly. The Babu found some hillmen to help. The men were kind but made the Babu drink a lot, making him talk badly about the government. They were curious about women and treated the Babu differently. The Babu got drunk and spoke of oppression in his land. He then sang and fell asleep. The Frenchman thought of visiting the Babu's Rajah to speak well of them.|"['1.

Hurree, a Babu from Chandernagore, lamented his inability to understand French spoken rapidly by the locals in Calcutta. He expressed frustration, even suggesting it might have been better to harm them. After a night of revelry, he feared he had said too much. His admiration for the British Government was professed upon his return, but his companions teased him until he revealed the truth. The men mocked him for his past words, eventually coaxing the truth from him. The Babu, feeling humiliated, led his companions down the slopes, alternating between pride and humility. He shared stories of the region, mixing facts with fiction. Meanwhile, Hurree Babu, eager to decipher the French conversations, eyed a kilta full of valuable documents, plotting a potential theft.

The lama, like a child absorbed in a new game, began a deep chant before revealing the full teachings of the Doctor of Divinity. The strangers, leaning on their alpenstocks, listened intently. Kim, watching humbly, noticed the red sunlight on their faces and the blend of their shadows. Their attire, different from English, reminded him of a book in St Xavier‚Äôs library. The coolies watched reverently nearby. The Babu stood by, looking pleased, as the lama continued the ritual. The lama, an artist and Abbot, showed a chart to the strangers. A Russian insulted the lama, leading to a scuffle with Kim. The coolies fled, fearing divine retribution. The Frenchman tried to intervene but was driven off by stones.

As they gazed at the breathtaking landscape, the lama contemplated the mysteries of life, feeling the weight of his soul's journey.

He carefully conceals the important items on his person and discards the rest out the window, ensuring no incriminating evidence remains.

"The rolling basket spilled its contents when it fell. The theodolite crashed into a protruding cliff and burst like a shell; the books, inkwells, paint sets, compasses, and rulers fluttered briefly like a swarm of bees. Then they disappeared; and though Kim, leaning halfway out of the window, strained his young ears, not a sound rose from the abyss.

""Five hundred‚Äîa thousand rupees could not replace them,"" he thought sadly. ""It was very wasteful, but I have all their other belongings‚Äîeverything they made‚ÄîI hope.
