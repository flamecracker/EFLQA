The _Yellow Streak_ vanished over the hill, briefly out of sight. Soon after, the _Blue Moon_ caught up, making progress easier. Slowly, they trailed the other bobsled.

The _Yellow Streak_ closed in, leading Glutts to panic, causing a crash. Onlookers saw the accident, including Jack Rover, who confronted Glutts. Despite the tension, Glutts walked away, dragging the _Yellow Streak_ while Jack held back, refraining from a fight due to his position as a company captain.|['1.

"""I think he's definitely German,"" Jack observed as the train resumed its journey. ""He had a strong German accent.""

""Many German-Americans are loyal,"" Gif added. ""They serve in the army, navy, and air force, fighting for Uncle Sam.""

""Absolutely!"" Andy agreed. ""Like Hans Mueller, loyal as ever. He's in the army and will do well.""

Gif changed the topic, concerned about reaching Timminsport late. They had arranged for Jed Wallop to meet them with a sled.

As they arrived in Timminsport, a crowd awaited, eager to help the injured passengers. Jed found Tim Doolittle, injured and needing rest. Jed offered to take Tim to Uncle Joe's, while the boys headed to Cedar Lodge alone, with instructions to follow the right path."|"['1.

"The eatery Gif had in mind was a small place on a side street behind the train station. Leaving their bags at the station and their guns with the station-master, they headed to the restaurant. Usually quiet at this hour, the place was bustling due to an accident. The cadets quickly ordered, and the waitress hurried to serve them. While waiting, Andy noticed other patrons and was surprised. ""I think I know where that camp is,"" Jack said, recalling a conversation at the theater. They finished their meal, left Glutts, Werner, and Codfish behind, and loaded the provisions onto the boxsled. The six cadets barely fit in the sled. Jack suggested using boards to secure the boxes and suitcases. They retrieved the suitcases and guns from the station and tied them securely to the sled before heading back."|['1.

Jack assured his friends that they would handle the situation carefully. He used his flashlight to inspect the suitcases, confirming that none of them had the required marking. After identifying each bag belonging to his friends, he emphasized the importance of allowing the others to search the sled before leaving to avoid any potential trouble. Gif, taking the reins, explained that the horses were reliable despite their lack of speed. As they traveled towards Cedar Lodge, Gif mentioned the sparse neighboring houses. Despite some uncertainty about the road, the group continued, with Fred expressing a desire to reach the lodge. While exploring the area with the flashlight, Jack noticed a pair of eyes in the bushes, indicating someone watching them with curiosity and fear.|"['1.

The group heard a snarl and a cry, signaling an animal nearby. With weapons and a flashlight in hand, they cautiously approached the bushes where the creature lurked. Following tracks in the snow, they discovered a wildcat in a tree. As the wildcat leaped down, ready to attack, Jack swiftly fired, injuring the animal. Another shot from Spouter subdued the wildcat.

"""We'll upset the first thing you know!"" exclaimed Fred. Suddenly, the sled hit rocks, and all the boys, including Gif, tumbled off along with their provisions. Gif called out to the tired horses, but they had already stopped. Everyone landed in the snow, escaping serious injuries. After gathering their belongings, they secured them with ropes. Fred and Randy scouted ahead, but the road grew rougher. Turning the sled without spilling everything was a challenge. They halted as they heard approaching sounds. A large sleigh with two horses approached. The driver, with a German accent, directed them back on the right path.

The path led over a small bridge crossing the river Gif mentioned, through a woods patch to a clearing with a Lodge. The Lodge, a log structure, stood in the center with a wide front veranda. Cedar trees flanked each end of the building, with more at the edge of the clearing. Behind, a barn, woodshed, and a small summer kitchen were located. Gif unlocked the door, and they lit lamps. They quickly moved baggage, provisions, guns, and the team to the Lodge. After settling in, they gathered wood for a fire. The Lodge had a living room at the center, flanked by two bedrooms on each side. A loft above was used for storage. They prepared the Lodge for the night, shaking out bedclothes and setting up the table for hot chocolate and snacks. The warm fire and cozy atmosphere made them forget their earlier troubles.|['Question 1:\nWhat structures were located behind the Lodge?\nA) A barn, a woodshed, and a small summer kitchen\nB) A greenhouse and a stable\nC) A gazebo and a pond\nD) A playground and a swimming pool\nE) A library and a conservatory', 'Question 2:\nWhat did Gif and the others do after unlocking the door to the Lodge?\nA) They went fishing in the river.\nB) They gathered wood for a fire.\nC) They went for a hike in the woods.\nD) They started cooking dinner in the summer kitchen.\nE) They went to explore the cedar trees.', 'Question 3:\nWhere was the living room located in the Lodge?\nA) In the loft above\nB) On the front veranda\nC) At the center of the Lodge\nD) In the barn\nE) In the woods patch', 'Question 4:\nWhat did they do to prepare the Lodge for the night?\nA) They went for a walk in the woods.\nB) They gathered more provisions.\nC) They set up the table for hot chocolate and snacks.\nD) They went to sleep immediately.\nE) They started a bonfire outside.', 'Question 5:\nWhat made them forget their earlier troubles?\nA) The sound of the river Gif mentioned\nB) The cedar trees at the edge of the clearing\nC) The summer kitchen\nD) The cozy atmosphere and warm fire\nE) The barn and woodshed', 'Question 6:\nWhere was the loft in the Lodge used for?\nA) Sleeping quarters\nB) Cooking meals\nC) Entertainment room\nD) Storage\nE) Bathing area']|['A) A barn, a woodshed, and a small summer kitchen', 'B) They gathered wood for a fire.', 'C) At the center of the Lodge', 'C) They set up the table for hot chocolate and snacks.', 'D) The cozy atmosphere and warm fire', 'D) Storage']
Their past camping experience helped the six cadets know how to tend the fire safely before heading to bed. After a day of travel, they quickly fell asleep. The Lodge filled with the tempting scent of pancakes and coffee. Fred's voice was heard from a bedroom. Breakfast was enjoyed as heavy snow fell outside. Gif suggested a rabbit hunt in the snow. The boys prepared, checking their gear and ammunition. Gif left a note for someone to take care of the horses. They set off on a trail, quietly hoping to spot rabbits. Jack noticed a flock of wild ducks above. Gif signaled to stop near a clearing to search for the rabbit run. They climbed rocks and saw rabbits below. Excited, the boys prepared to shoot, with Jack giving the order. One rabbit noticed them and froze, ears perked.|"['1.

The group of six boys went hunting for rabbits in the woods. They fired their shotguns, causing some rabbits to fall lifeless while others were wounded and put out of their misery. Jack and his friends pursued the remaining rabbits, managing to catch a few. As they walked back through the snow, the wind picked up, making them decide to return to Cedar Lodge. On their way, they kept an eye out for more game but only saw squirrels they couldn't shoot. When they reached the lodge, they met Jed Wallop, who shared some directions with them.

Leaving Gif to tend the fire, the others rushed to the woodshed to carry logs inside. They heated water, swiftly cleaned the dishes, tidied the living room, and fixed their beds. By five o'clock, they felt refreshed and began preparing dinner with rabbit, potatoes, onions, biscuits, and tea. In the evening, they read magazines and played checkers. The snowstorm outside intensified, and suddenly, two boys, Bill and Gabe, arrived in distress with a sleigh full of provisions. The group welcomed them, offering warmth and tea. Gif and Jack braved the storm to shelter the exhausted horse and provisions. They discovered that Bill and Gabe came from a place two miles away, owned by a man named Duval, rumored to be a thief.|"['1.

Recently, Duval has specialized in renting out his property to hunters. He has a few shacks on his land that he offers to groups of hunters. Duval is known to be skilled at cooking, so he also offers to prepare meals for the hunters if they desire. It seems that Gabe Werner and Glutts have taken up one of the shacks. Meanwhile, Stowell has opted to stay in town until the storm passes. Glutts and Werner are now inside, enjoying hot tea and doughnuts provided by Fred and Andy. Despite the chilly reception, Gif offers them a place to sleep and extra blankets. The snowstorm rages outside, coating the cedars in a blanket of snow, creating a scene of awe and beauty.

Gif assured Glutts that there was no need to pay for anything. However, he suggested they come to an understanding due to the tension between their groups. Despite the bullies' presence, a bountiful New Year's dinner was prepared, lifting everyone's spirits. The boys spent the day relaxing and reading, followed by a light supper.

The two Rovers came back to the Lodge and shared their findings. A search was done around the Lodge, checking their clothes, firearms, supplies, and regular items. Gif noticed a missing flannel blanket and assumed the bullies took it for warmth. Spouter realized some canned goods were missing too. Despite the missing items, the group felt relieved the bullies were gone. They had a fun snowball fight and then went hunting, catching rabbits, squirrels, and quail. Jack suggested enlarging a hole for a morning swim routine. They later caught fish, shared a delicious meal, and saved some for later. The boys also updated the old hunter on the bullies' departure. Wallop warned about potential dangers in the area due to deepening snow.|"['1.

The boys eagerly awaited their letters, putting everything else aside. Mrs. Dick Rover's letter mentioned nothing significant happening back home. Ruth and May were still with them, but the girls planned to spend the rest of their school break at the Stevenson homestead. Dick Rover's letter was from the battlefront in France, detailing small engagements and injuries. Despite the challenges, they were determined to face the enemy. The boys enjoyed skating on the ice, racing down the river. They explored the area, buying supplies at a store in Henryville. While out, they spotted a sleigh with German-looking passengers.

As usual with cedars, the branches were close together, making it a challenge for Andy to reach the dead partridge. Despite the difficulties, he persevered, inching his way up until he was just a few feet away from his prize. As he descended, a strange cry caught his attention, sounding like an angry cat. Andy realized there was something lurking below him among the branches. His friends circled the cedar cautiously, ready to protect him. Suddenly, a wildcat leaped from the tree, prompting a flurry of gunfire from Gif, Randy, and Spouter. The wildcat vanished into the forest, leaving the group shaken but determined to continue their hunt. They bagged some rabbits and discussed climbing a tree to locate the Lodge, but the falling snow made it a challenging decision.|"[""1.

Gif returned to the group after fifteen minutes, unsure if he found the right location due to heavy snow. He regretted the snowfall hindering his view to locate the bungalow. Despite the challenging trail, they pressed on. Snow intensified, making it harder to see. As darkness fell, they reached a rocky area with snow-covered bushes. Feeling exhausted, Fred struggled, and Jack offered to carry his gun. They found a spot under fallen cedars and started a campfire. With cedar boughs as flooring and bedding, they made preparations for the night. They used a tin box for boiling water to make cocoa, a comfort during the cold evening.|"[""1.

After a few days, which included Sunday, the six cadets relaxed. They only went hunting once due to the snow. During that outing, they caught more rabbits and quail. While exploring, they found small shacks owned by a French-Canadian with minimal amenities. Tony Duval, a resident, accused them of causing trouble and threatened them with a shotgun. Despite trying to reason with him, he remained stubborn and ordered them to leave. As they walked through the woods, they spotted their rivals, Werner, Glutts, and Codfish, shooting at rabbits unsuccessfully. The cadets cautiously observed from a distance, avoiding being mistaken for game. They noticed the trio setting up a campfire and preparing for lunch, strategizing to use snowballs to surprise them from the higher slope.|['1.

The Rovers and their friends quickly reached the higher, steeper slope pointed out by Andy. From there, they could see Werner, Glutts, and Codfish below, busy preparing their lunch. The bullies had brought plenty of food, some laid out on a napkin and the rest warming over the campfire. The group decided to roll snowballs down the slope towards the bullies, causing chaos as the snowballs crashed through the lunch and campfire. A scuffle ensued, with the bullies getting a well-deserved drubbing and their weapons confiscated. The boys then confronted Tony Duval, demanding that Codfish accompany them back to Timminsport. As they were leaving, a sleigh arrived with mysterious Germans heading into Duval's shack, leaving the boys curious about their intentions. Despite their eagerness to learn more, they had to leave, with the Germans' visit remaining a mystery.|"['1.

"""We must watch the Germans from behind Tony Duval's shack,"" suggested Gif. ""Maybe we'll hear their conversation."" Jack, Gif, and Spouter decided to take a detour through the woods while the twins and Fred returned to Cedar Lodge. As they approached Duval's shack cautiously, they noticed a raised window letting out heat from a roaring fire inside. Peeking in, Jack saw a German return a wallet and Duval stash away bank bills. The Germans then flung open the door. The cadets were intrigued by the suspicious behavior and Duval's fear of the authorities. Back at Cedar Lodge, they uncovered hidden goods belonging to Glutts and Werner. Glutts expressed regret for leaving home, realizing the mistake he made.

The old barn and other buildings showed signs of recent use, with tracks in the snow leading to the house. Jed suggested knocking on the door to talk to the occupants, but Jack wanted to observe first. Andy and Randy hid in the hay, while the group found machinery in a shed. Jack decided to approach the house alone, pretending to be hunting for food. An elderly woman responded in broken English. Feeling watched, they left and planned to return later. They went for a hunt, encountering wildlife and enjoying hot chocolate. While exploring cautiously, they spotted a fox. Gif shot at it, but only grazed the animal, which fled in surprise.|['1.

Randy and his friends had a thrilling day hunting in the woods. They managed to shoot a fox and a few partridges. As they were about to head home, they encountered the farmer they had once rescued. The farmer, Herman Crouse, explained that he was not interested in getting involved in any conflicts and just wanted to be left alone. He thanked the boys for their help and wished them luck with their hunting before continuing on his way home.

Herman Crouse, a German-American, warned the boys to steer clear of some acquaintances. He advised them that better hunting spots were elsewhere. After parting ways, Herman continued on his journey, leaving the boys to explore on their own. They followed him to an old house where they saw him interact with other German men. The men exchanged money and conversed in German. The boys, Jack, Gif, and Fred, sneaked into a barn where they found hidden packing cases. The Germans, led by a man named Herr Bauermann, inspected the contents of the cases. The boys, curious about the mysterious boxes, peeked through cracks in the loft to catch a glimpse of machinery and coils of wire inside.|['**1.

While the men explored, one of them suddenly bent down and retrieved an item from the ground. He showed it to the others, making remarks the boys couldn't understand. The Germans were very interested in the discovery of the glove. They searched the barn thoroughly, causing the cadets in the loft to worry they might be found. Eventually, the Germans assumed the glove belonged to Herman Crouse and left it on a shelf. The cadets were frozen after the Germans departed, unable to move to keep warm. They decided to head home to have supper. Remembering their past encounters with submarine villains, they hurried back to Cedar Lodge through the woods. Exhausted and cold, they were welcomed by Henry Stowell, who had prepared a warm meal. Stowell shared some information about Werner's suspicious activities, hinting at a deeper mystery.

The storm raged on all day, with the wind growing stronger. The boys huddled inside the Lodge, keeping the fire going. They read, wrote letters, played games, and even tried making candy, pies, and cookies. Gif, Jack, and the twins braved the wind to reach the woodshed nearby. Suddenly, wolves approached, their eyes menacing. The boys quickly shut and bolted the door. They prepared to defend themselves with shotguns, firing at the wolves as they approached.

Gif's guess was right, and they all walked to the hotel where the sleigh to the other town departed. Stowell easily got a room in this place and soon left for home.
