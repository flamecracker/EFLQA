After many exciting experiences in New York City, Joe and Blake journeyed out West, where they encountered cowboys, Indians, and peril. Their adventures continued on the Pacific Coast, in the jungle with wild animals, and in Earthquake Land, facing danger from earthquakes and volcanoes. Despite the risks, they returned safely with rare films. Taking a break at Mr. Hiram Baker's farm near Central Falls, their peace was interrupted by a urgent assignment from Mr. Ringold.

The carriage swayed ahead of them as the horse raced against a motorbike. The boys needed to cross a field to reach a bridge. Despite the danger, Blake decided to go for it. The motorbike entered the field but suddenly slowed down. The horse leaped over the bridge's edge, leaving the carriage hanging. The boys managed to pull the carriage back from the ravine's brink just in time. The men in the carriage were stuck, with one unconscious. Hank, the driver, seemed unhurt but anxious. They needed to be careful not to send the carriage plummeting down the ravine. Hank warned them to be cautious as they worked to rescue the trapped men.|"[""1.

The Spaniard expressed his gratitude towards Joe and Blake for saving his life. He promised to repay the favor and show his gratitude in various ways in the future. Despite the confusion about their missing horse, the Spaniard seemed appreciative. When a letter fell out of his pocket addressed to Joe and Blake from the Film Theatrical Company, he was astonished. The Spaniard was overwhelmed by the turn of events and seemed a bit disoriented. Hank suggested getting a doctor due to the recent events, but Joe and Blake remembered a nearby spring and offered to fetch water instead.

"""I apologize for the inconvenience,"" the Spaniard continued, ""as today has been quite eventful. First, the unexpected runaway, followed by the fortunate abrupt halt,"" he said, peering towards the gulch where the horse lay. ""And then your heroic act of pulling us back from the brink of death,"" he added with a tone of awe and gratitude. ""I can't express my gratitude now, but someday I hope to show it."" Joe and Blake exchanged puzzled looks, and then turned to Hank, their guide, who had driven them on previous trips before they acquired the motorbike. ""I must apologize again,"" Mr. Alcando said quickly. ""I'm not myself today, but meeting you, whom I sought, was a surprise. Now, if you'll excuse me,"" he said, glancing at the letter addressed to Blake and Joe.

To engage the public and attract investors, the idea of using moving pictures was proposed. This concept, put forth by Mr. Alcando, was well-received, and he was tasked with organizing it. In order to ensure that the films would be beneficial to the railroad's efforts, Mr. Alcando felt it necessary to understand the intricacies of the film industry. He was sent to New York by his company, where he was introduced to Mr. Hadley of the Film Theatrical Company. Mr. Hadley recommended two boys, who had recently returned from aiding in a flood zone, as guides to help Mr. Alcando learn more about the film business. Surprised by the sudden mention of Panama in a letter, the boys were taken aback but intrigued by the unexpected opportunity.

"As usual, we will pay you boys well and cover all expenses. It's unfortunate to interrupt your vacation again, like we did for the flood pictures, but the anticipated big slide can't wait. You must be quick to capture the views. I'll await your response.

Joe noticed something odd. The Spaniard we saved seemed bothered that it was us. He acted as if he would have preferred someone else to rescue him. Maybe he's just overly polite and didn't want to inconvenience us.

Joe agreed, finding the Spaniard's behavior strange but dramatic. Despite any reservations, they both felt obligated to honor Mr. Hadley's request to film the impressive Panama Canal's Culebra Cut.

Blake and Joe were intrigued by the tales of landslides in a book they were reading. The challenges faced by French and American engineers while constructing the Canal were discussed. The engineers underestimated the width needed to prevent soil slides, eventually widening it to 1800 feet. Despite their interest, the boys decided to inform Mr. Hadley of their plans before proceeding. They were then welcomed by Mr. Alcando, a courteous Spaniard. Although polite, there was a hint of nervousness in his demeanor, leaving the boys curious. During a visit to his room, a gust of wind scattered papers, revealing a snippet of a letter mentioning disappearing letters. Mr. Alcando made light of the situation, thanking the boys for their inadvertent help.|"[""1.

Not knowing the American language can be a challenge, as Mr. Alcando and his friends discovered. In a letter, his friend confused 'guns' with 'ones,' wishing for big pictures instead of big guns. Mr. Alcando hoped to learn about taking moving pictures and planned to correct his friend's misunderstanding.

"""Oh, that's all nonsense!"" laughed Mr. Hadley. ""We have investigated his credentials, and find them all right. Besides, what object would a South American spy have in finding out details of the defenses at Panama. South America would work to preserve the Canal; not to destroy it. If it were some European nation now, that would be a different story. You don't need to worry, Blake.""

""No, I suppose it is foolish. But I'm glad to know you think Mr. Alcando all right. If we've got to live in close companionship with him for several months, it's a comfort to know he is all right. Now when are we to start, how do we go, where shall we make our headquarters and so on?""

Blake and Joe, seasoned travelers, were uninterested in the typical scenes of their ship's departure due to their numerous past adventures. Despite their youth, they had experienced thrilling journeys out West, to the Pacific Coast, jungle lands, earthquake sites, and the flooded Mississippi Valley. Mr. Alcando, a Spaniard traveling with them, preferred the deck's open air during departure. He had a deep appreciation for the boys saving his life and was eager to help them prepare for their voyage to Panama. On the steamer, they encountered tourists and personally guided groups. As they sailed toward Colon, the weather turned cooler, hinting at winter's approach. Mr. Alcando, enthusiastic about their destination, engaged Joe and Blake in technical discussions about moving picture work.

Joe agreed, suggesting the ticking noise might be from something in the bedclothes. Without hesitation, Joe uncovered a small brass-bound box near the foot of the berth, containing metal projections causing the sound. Blake dismissed it as a foreign alarm clock hidden to muffle the noise. Joe's pale face surprised Blake, as Mr. Alcando was usually cheerful. Blake explained they heard the ticking, leading to the discovery. Mr. Alcando revealed it was his new alarm clock, an invention he was testing before selling. Adjusting the mechanism, the ticking stopped, bringing relief. Excited for Panama, Mr. Alcando shared plans to explore the canal and learn about filmmaking, grateful for his friends' support.|"['1.

"""I am pleased with your enthusiasm,"" replied the other person. ""I am eager to start working and even more excited to venture into the depths of the jungle with my camera along the railway lines to showcase our efforts in civilizing the area. The film will be a window for the world to witness our progress,"" he added, in a poetic tone. Despite Joe's suspicions about the young Spaniard, nothing in the following days confirmed his doubts. The strange alarm clock was not mentioned again, nor was it found in Mr. Alcando's room. Joe speculated that the Spaniard might be pretending to learn about filming, hiding his true expertise until the conditions were right. As days passed, the boys arrived at Colon's excellent harbor, feeling the grandeur of the Panama Canal project. They settled in the comfortable Washington Hotel, enjoying the luxuries of the North in a Southern setting. Plans were made to film the Canal and jungle, and they eagerly awaited the government tug to start their filming journey. Their wait was pleasant, meeting new acquaintances and preparing their cameras for the trip. They were to film as guests of the U.S. government, with the films becoming part of an official exhibit.

On a calm night, the only sounds were the gentle rush of the waves on the shore. Joe and Blake heard distant voices from the Spaniard's balcony. The boys sensed a secretive discussion. Across the space, Blake inquired about Joe's fear of someone beating him to patent a focus tube invention. The next morning, the group boarded the tug _Nama_. A man hurried to Mr. Alcando with a message. The group was joined by Army engineers. As the real work began, Joe and Blake focused on their moving picture project.

"A boat travels along a canal until it reaches a lock. The boat enters a basin, and a gate closes behind it. Water is then added to the basin from a higher part of the canal, raising the boat to that level. The gate opens, allowing the boat to continue at the higher level. This process is like going ""uphill"" on the canal. In the Panama Canal, some parts are 85 feet higher than others. For example, a vessel entering at Colon must rise 85 feet to reach Gatun Lake. As the vessel approaches the Pacific end, it descends 85 feet through a series of locks. The tug with Blake, Joe, and Mr. Alcando heads towards Toro Point breakwater to start filming their journey through the canal. They learn about the breakwater and the protective measures in place at the locks."|['1.

"""What would happen if you did hit the chain?"" inquired Blake as they continued their journey through the locks. Blake and Joe were capturing images of the chain in action. The captain explained that if a large vessel like the _Olympic_ collided with the chain at a slow speed, it would come to a stop within about seventy feet due to the chain's mechanism. The chain is operated by hydraulic power and can withstand immense pressure before breaking. Even if a vessel managed to break the chain and the first gate, there is a second gate as a safety measure. Additionally, emergency dams are in place to prevent flooding in case of a catastrophic event. The boys eagerly photographed the opening and closing of the lock gates, powered by electricity and fed by water from Gatun Lake. The gates parted slowly, resembling the pages of a book unfolding, allowing the vessel to pass through.

Blake hesitated before speaking, finding himself unexpectedly suspicious of Mr. Alcando. Joe, too, remembered his own past doubts about the Spaniard, now disarmed by his candidness. Captain Watson sarcastically remarked on the dangers of dynamite, emphasizing the immense effort in the ongoing work at Culebra Cut. The boys, equipped with cameras, planned to document the final stages of the canal construction. Standing atop Gold Hill, they marveled at the colossal excavation - a nine-mile cut, 120 feet deep, with towering sides and a wide base. The captain vividly described the earlier labor-intensive process of removing dirt before the waterways were operational. As they continued filming the canal's progress, they prepared for their journey through Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks towards the Pacific Ocean, eagerly capturing the completion of this monumental engineering feat.|"['1.

The boat was tied to the pier, waiting for the electric trains to help it move, when a foreign ship arrived. Blake and Joe, near the captain, saw Mr. Alcando looking at the big ship. A breeze made the flag on the foreign ship flutter, showing Brazilian colors. Mr. Alcando waved at someone on the ship. Suddenly, Captain Watson shouted a warning. The foreign ship veered, crashing into the boat, causing chaos. Joe wished he had a camera to film the scene. The boat was stuck between the ship and the pier. The foreign ship started moving away, helping to release the boat. The boat slowly sank, but valuable items were saved. The boat was towed away to prevent any navigation problems.

For a brief moment, a strange calm settled over the chaos. The rush of water from Gatun Lake surged towards the _Bohio_ tugging at its mooring cables. Mr. Alcando, usually not one to shy away from danger, found himself capturing the unfolding events with his camera. The accidental opening of the lock gates unleashed a torrent that threatened to overwhelm the vessel. Yet, the cables held, allowing the _Bohio_ to rise with the flood. As the water surged, Blake and Joe stood steadfast, filming the unfolding drama. Captain Wiltsey tried to navigate the powerful current with the engine at full throttle.

Mr. Alcando had shown he could film nature scenes as well as the boys. But filming nature wasn't the only aspect of their work. They also captured theatrical scenes and indoor and outdoor dramas. Outside the cabin, the boys prepared to film despite the rain and the ominous sound of earth sliding into the Canal. The boys quickly readied their cameras and waterproof gear. As the earth continued to slide down Gold Hill, the boys rushed to capture the disaster. The film was sensitive enough to work in poor light. Emergency orders were given to address the slide.

The project was completed successfully after much hard work. However, a deceitful major shareholder of the railroad devised a malicious scheme. Initially, other shareholders resisted, but he convinced them by painting a grim picture of the railroad's future. His plan involved causing small explosions near Culebra Cut or the dam to scare away shippers from using the Canal, thus benefiting the railroad. He intended to blame innocent parties and use moving pictures to carry out the explosions discreetly. Despite his initial intentions to frame innocent parties, a change of heart occurred when the Spaniard encountered the boys who saved his life.
