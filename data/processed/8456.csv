After dinner, Patty and Cousin Tom took a stroll on the deck, but the strong wind made them retreat to the cozy saloon. Sitting on a red velvet sofa, Cousin Tom engaged in a conversation that went over Patty's head. Unintentionally, the gentle rocking of the boat and the continuous chatter put Patty to sleep.

In a rush to catch their train to Boston, Cousin Tom hurried Patty along, offering her a simple breakfast of coffee and a roll.

Patty, a mischievous girl in the Fleming household, decided to play a prank on her family by setting all the clocks two hours ahead on the morning of April 1st. She carefully adjusted the time on various clocks in the house, including those in the dining room, kitchen, and her relatives' rooms. Patty even managed to change the time on her cousin Elizabeth's watch without waking her up. The next morning, the family was thrown into chaos as everyone woke up thinking they had overslept. Bridget and Molly, the maids, were the first to panic, followed by Cousin Elizabeth, who was distressed about being late for her engagement at the Authors' Club.

There was quite a stir among the group as everyone checked their watches and clocks, expressing surprise and dismay. Tom's watch showed half-past seven, but since it wasn't reliable, no one believed him when the others confirmed it was actually half-past nine. Cousin Elizabeth was initially furious but then found humor in the situation, laughing at the April Fool's joke Patty played on them. Bridget and Molly, being Irish, found it particularly amusing. However, Ruth didn't see the fun in it. Patty felt sorry that Ruth wasn't enjoying herself and promised to make her stay more enjoyable by organizing youthful activities.

"Patty sang delightful child-songs by Robert Louis Stevenson, and Ruth recited a part of ""The Courtship of Miles Standish."" The audience was entertained by Cousin Elizabeth as Lady Jane, and Cousin Tom as Sir Thomas, a comical naturalist.

Patty felt a mix of excitement and apprehension about her visit, anticipating boating and bathing adventures with her cousins.

"Marian explained, ""I helped set up the room and made some items like sofa pillows. We were excited for your visit. However, Patty's clothes were in poor condition.

"""Yes, we can do that,"" Patty eagerly responded. ""My father always sends me money when I ask, so if you buy me some clothes, he'll repay you right away. I need everything. My current clothes are no good at all.""

"""No,"" said the little boy, and somehow, Mrs. Elliott didn't know how, but in an instant, Gilbert had hopped into a small boat and was alone on the lake.
