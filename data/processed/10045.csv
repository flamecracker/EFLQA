Dave and Darrin, two midshipmen, discovered a fellow midshipman named Pennington involved in opium smoking at Chow Hop's den. Determined to uphold midshipman honor, they decided to report the matter to the chief of police. Dave urged a delay to prevent other midshipmen from falling into the same trap. Dr. Lawrence was called to help Pennington recover. The doctor explained that Pennington had turned to opium due to a toothache, fearing the consequences of seeking medical help. Darrin understood the pressure midshipmen faced with medical issues.

"Pennington, feeling remorseful, confessed to seeking opium for a toothache, misled by a clerk. He was worried about his reputation among midshipmen, fearing they might gossip about his mishap. In naval slang, seeking favor for promotions is scornfully termed ""greasing."" The midshipmen were instructed to familiarize themselves with the ship before reporting at 5 p.m. Pennington, suffering from a throbbing toothache, sought advice from Hallam. They located the sick-bay, where Pennington was diagnosed with an ulcerated tooth. The captain, aware of the situation, ordered Pennington and Hallam to report to the commandant of cadets.

Dave went to the authorities because he knew the new fourth class midshipmen were away from home for the first time and might be tempted to misbehave. The Navy captain praised Dave's quick and wise actions, though he warned that some classmates might not appreciate it. The midshipmen were divided into sections for ship training during the cruise, with Dave leading the electrical instruction group. The chief electrician emphasized the importance of not touching switches without permission due to potential dangers. The midshipmen listened attentively and learned about the ship's machinery.

Dave, with his injured shoulder causing him great pain, stopped as soon as he reached the bottom. The area was dimly lit, with some light reflecting from a distant bulb. Heistand, likely of German descent but without an accent, appeared friendly yet strict to the crew. He instructed the midshipmen on tending to furnaces, lighting fires, and cleaning. Two firemen were tasked with coal delivery, while Heistand demonstrated proper shoveling techniques. The furnaces were lit, and Heistand explained the use of water gauges. The midshipmen, now covered in coal dust, worked diligently despite the heat. Dan worried about Pen's intentions, suspecting hidden motives. Pen approached Dave privately, discussing avoiding trouble and potential consequences. The passage highlighted the importance of discipline and respect among naval academy students.|"[""1.

Earlier that day, Pennington intentionally injured Darrin's shoulder, causing him pain. Despite the disagreement about resting the shoulder, they agreed to settle things in a barn.

"""Don't let him outsmart you, David, stay sharp!"" cautioned Dan, as he and Farley vigorously massaged Darrin's muscles. ""He almost had you, and we shouldn't give Pen an easy win."" After the officials left the barn, Dalzell focused on helping his friend while Farley assisted the defeated midshipman. Darrin and his companions headed off to enjoy the remaining shore leave, while Pennington's team left him at an ice cream parlor. Pennington, not in top shape, chose to rest. During the voyage, the midshipmen learned about battleships, serving as firemen, mastering electrical details, and practicing with guns. As they neared England, they hurried for supper formation. Pennington, with hidden money, planned to explore with friends. The fleet's arrival in a fortified port involved salutes between ships and forts to show respect. The midshipmen prepared for official visits the next day. Dave, Dan, and Farley decided to explore the town rather than ride, aiming to learn more on their own."|"['1.

Plymouth is an ancient English seaport that has been well-known since the thirteenth century. Many parts of the town, like entire streets, appear to have been built during that time. This is particularly true for streets near the waterfront. The three midshipmen explored the streets for two hours, meeting classmates along the way. English workers and shopkeepers greeted them warmly in their American uniforms. In the afternoon, they visited the new market and bought souvenirs for their families. Dave even got a gift for his sweetheart. However, their curiosity led them to a shed where they were tricked, leaving them in a humorous predicament. Despite the situation, Dave took responsibility, showing true friendship to his comrades.|"[""1.

"""I can hardly believe that an Englishman would play such a trick on young officers of a friendly power,"" he declared. ""But I told you, sir, the fare out to your ship would be half a sov. I lied. If a nasty little cockney played such a trick on you, it's my place, as a decent Englishman, to take you out for nothing--and that's the fare.""

As the second launch left the side gangway, the Briton, who had been preparing well, ranged alongside. In his most seamanlike style, the Briton pulled up next to the ship. Dave tried to pay the fare, but the skipper refused. The three middies shook hands with the Briton, then headed across to the side gangway, acknowledging the stranger. The Briton waved heartily before leaving.

None of the three midshipmen considered letting go of the life buoys and giving up as a way out of their predicament. Firstly, human nature clings to hope, and secondly, suicide is seen as a cowardly choice. The liner ahead launched a rescue boat guided by signals from a lookout. Despite the zig-zag course, the boat eventually reached the midshipmen. They were quickly taken to a stateroom, stripped, warmed, and fed. The ship's doctor commended their heroic actions, especially Darrin's effort to save the life buoys. Pennington's lack of acknowledgment was noted by many. The marine sentry's quick action in releasing a buoy led to the rescue of another young man. The class noticed Pennington's aloofness towards Darrin after his rescue from the sea.|"['1.

"""Danny, don't attempt that. Running a red light is risky, especially with candles. The wax will likely drip and be discovered by the authorities. There's no point in studying if you keep getting in trouble."" After dinner, both students gave up their free time and returned to their desks to study. They worked diligently until the bell signaled the end of the study period. ""It's not easy,"" the senior student admitted. ""Nothing at Annapolis is simple, except maybe dancing.

Oh, the experiences missed by being stuck in an office like this!"" ""Neither you nor I officially know about this fight. The Navy is a fighting force. Can we afford to lose a fighter like that young man?"" The midshipmen were surprised and pleased by the invite. It was unusual for officers to invite midshipmen, especially those who were socially active. Darrin and Dalzell hid their shock but accepted happily. At Mrs. Stearns' drawing room, they met two lovely girls, Flora and Marian. Flora was blonde and friendly, while Marian, a dark and bold contrast, had her eyes set on Navy life and marriage within it. Despite Marian's attempts to charm him, Darrin remained loyal to Belle Mead, seeing Marian only as a fun friend.
