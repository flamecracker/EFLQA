During the late 14th and early 15th centuries, chroniclers like Froissart, Monstrelet, and Holinshed provided detailed accounts of events, particularly the Commons' uprising against serfdom under Richard II. Despite less severe serfdom in England compared to the Continent, English serfs faced hardships. They were tied to the land, restricted from trading, and excluded from warfare. The uprising has been wrongly linked to Wickliffe's Church criticisms. The turmoil in Flanders also concerned the English due to historical alliances. Edgar Ormskirk, a scholarly boy, discussed the current state of affairs with the prior at St. Alwyth's convent. Edgar's father, a scholar, had retreated from society after his wife's death, focusing on studies and alchemy to improve society.|"['1.

A father, Mr. Ormskirk, who had not paid much attention to his son Edgar, was suddenly confronted by the Prior of the Convent of St. Alwyth about the boy's upbringing. The Prior suggested that it was time for Edgar to receive a proper education and be guided away from his mischievous ways. Mr. Ormskirk, preoccupied with his studies, agreed that his son needed direction and education suited to his status. The Prior proposed a scholar from the convent to tutor Edgar, as the monastery at Westminster might not be the best fit due to his lack of prior training. Mr. Ormskirk decided to have a scholar from the convent educate Edgar for a few hours a day, as it would benefit both the boy and the convent financially.

Seven years had passed since Andrew was sent to Dartford to bring back a tailor and find a teacher of arms for Edgar. The once rough boy had grown into a tall young man, excelling in his studies and combat training. His father, unknowingly, had also been a great teacher. Meals were now enjoyed leisurely with engaging conversations. Edgar's father, a recluse, found joy in discussing history and current events with his son. Despite his initial hopes for Edgar to become a scholar, his interests lay in combat and adventure stories. His father wisely recognized this and shifted his focus to nurturing Edgar's skills with weapons. He advised Edgar on the virtues of being a gentleman and warned of potential civil unrest in England. Edgar was encouraged to follow his own path, whether scholarly or martial, and to always act according to his conscience.|"['Question 1:\nWhat was Andrew sent to Dartford for?\nA) To find a tailor and a teacher of arms for Edgar\nB) To bring back a tailor and a chef for Edgar\nC) To bring back a tailor and a teacher of history for Edgar\nD) To find a tailor and a teacher of music for Edgar\nE) To find a tailor and a teacher of mathematics for Edgar', 'Question 2:\nHow had Andrew changed over the years?\nA) He became a recluse\nB) He excelled in his studies and combat training\nC) He became disinterested in conversations\nD) He became a scholar\nE) He became a tailor', ""Question 3:\nWhat did Edgar's father find joy in discussing with his son?\nA) Cooking recipes\nB) History and current events\nC) Adventure stories\nD) Combat techniques\nE) Mathematics problems"", ""Question 4:\nWhat did Edgar's father initially hope for Edgar to become?\nA) A tailor\nB) A scholar\nC) A chef\nD) A musician\nE) A mathematician"", ""Question 5:\nWhat did Edgar's interests lie in?\nA) Cooking\nB) Combat and adventure stories\nC) Music\nD) Mathematics\nE) History"", ""Question 6:\nWhat did Edgar's father advise him on?\nA) To ignore his interests and focus on scholarly pursuits\nB) To act against his conscience\nC) To always act according to his conscience\nD) To avoid combat training\nE) To become a recluse""]"|['A) To find a tailor and a teacher of arms for Edgar', 'B) He excelled in his studies and combat training', 'B) History and current events', 'B) A scholar', 'B) Combat and adventure stories', 'C) To always act according to his conscience']
At fifteen, Edgar stopped his lessons, having learned what was necessary for that time. He continued practicing with his weapons but didn't see much use for them beyond self-defense. Back then, joining the army wasn't a common career choice. Soldiers were raised when the king needed them for battles in France or Scotland, and then they dispersed after the campaign. Edgar discussed these matters with the Prior of St. Alwyth, who believed that the people's discontent could lead to dangerous uprisings. The Prior felt that the peasants should have more rights and better treatment to prevent unrest. He worried that the teachings of Wickliffe were causing trouble and that the peasants might rise up against their masters. The Prior feared that if the peasants rebelled, they might commit violent acts, including attacking the nobles' castles.|"['1.

Edgar, a young boy, discussed with a wise man about the misunderstandings people have towards those they don't understand. They talked about how Edgar's father, who was a scholar, was labeled a magician by ignorant villagers. The wise man shared stories of past injustices and revolts due to heavy taxation. Edgar, upon reflecting on the prior's words, realized the growing discontent among the villagers towards the government's taxes. He sympathized with their plight and understood their frustrations. Edgar had attended secret meetings where grievances were aired, but he became wary of a priest named Jack Straw, who incited hatred towards the clergy.

History reveals that mobs often struggle to maintain resistance against authority. Initially, they may achieve some success, but once those in power recover, they swiftly quell the uprising. It is regrettable not only for the rioters themselves but also for dissenters like me who oppose any form of revolt. Initially, the mob may follow their leaders and show restraint, but they can quickly turn savage, especially when blood is shed. If the rebellion escalates, it can lead to destruction and violence, with heads rolling and chaos reigning. Sir Ralph De Courcy mentioned the dangerous ideas circulating among the rebels, advocating for seizing wealthy goods and estates. These radical notions could incite further unrest and harm. It is essential to avoid such conflicts and seek peaceful resolutions to societal issues.|"['1.

Edgar, I was surprised when I told Sir Ralph about my preparations for defense. Some compounds in my lab are dangerous, not due to magic. Innocent substances, when mixed, can cause destruction. For example, saltpetre, charcoal, and sulfur create explosive powder. I found a luminous powder two years ago. It glowed without heat. I painted symbols with it, and they glowed in the dark. This powder could awe a crowd. I painted a Roman statue's head with it, and in darkness, it glowed brightly. It seemed magical, but it's a natural wonder.

I question if fewer than five thousand soldiers and archers could confront the approaching army effectively. It seems impossible to gather such a force, especially when considering the unruly citizens of London who will join them. The city rabble will need controlling, in addition to facing the enemy. It's uncertain if the gathered troops can be relied upon entirely, as they may hesitate to fight against their own kind. Even those from the Tower of London may not all be trustworthy. While the fortress could hold for months if well defended, it's doubtful it will withstand a siege. The king could easily escape, leaving the place before it's surrounded.

John of Gaunt, the ambitious Duke of Lancaster, is a powerful figure in England. Although some suspect he desires to rule as king, it is believed he aims to govern in the king's name. He has a strong following, including his brother, the Duke of Gloucester, and other nobles. However, the people are not fond of him, as seen in Canterbury where rioters swore to obey the king and commons, meaning themselves, and to oppose John of Gaunt and his allies.

We continued our journey, hoping to reach the city gates before they closed. Unfortunately, the horse was moving slowly, and we were three miles away when the city bells chimed the hour. Despite my hopes that my name's recognition in the city might grant us entry, the gatekeepers were unaware of it. They explained that without an order from the lord mayor or a sheriff, they couldn't open the gates due to strict regulations during the troubled times. I remembered hearing about an inn built for late travelers outside the walls and asked for directions. After a brief ride back, we encountered two men who directed us to the King's Head hostelry. As we approached the supposed inn, suspicions arose, and a dangerous situation unfolded. Despite being ambushed, I managed to defend myself until help arrived, preventing a disastrous outcome.

"""We should remain silent,"" one of them advised. ""This is just a street fight, and your father warned us not to get involved. It won't be a fair battle; it will turn into a massacre.

The next day, the king knighted the lord mayor, William Walworth, Robert Gaiton, and five other aldermen who had ridden with him. An augmentation to the city's arms was granted, adding a short sword or dagger to the shield in honor of the lord mayor's brave act. Van Voorden visited Sir Ralph with Robert Gaiton to express gratitude for their sons' heroism in saving Dame Agatha and Aline. They also learned how the young men had defeated seven rioters. Sir Ralph acknowledged their valor but suggested they wait a couple of years before becoming knights to learn obedience and leadership. Sir Robert offered fifty men to aid the king against rebels in Kent and Essex, and Sir Ralph accepted, grateful for the support.

Van Voorden and his companion visited Master Armstrong's armor shop to purchase two suits of armor. Van Voorden expressed his desire for the best quality armor, emphasizing that cost was not an issue. The armorer, Master Armstrong, showcased his finest suits, pointing out their superior craftsmanship and strength.

Riding swiftly towards the rioters, the knights increased their speed to a fierce gallop as they approached. The rioters noticed them and chaos ensued. Some rioters fled, while others stood their ground. Arrows were shot but missed most of the charging knights. The knights, with swords drawn, charged through the crowd, causing havoc. The rioters scattered, seeking mercy, but the knights showed little. The knights pursued the rioters for an hour, seeking revenge for the insults to the princess and the Flemings. Edgar and Albert rode together, their armor protecting them from harm. After the chaos settled, they returned to the castle, where they found many rioters had been slain.

"As they sailed down the Thames, Edgar asked, ""Why is Ghent at war with the Earl of Flanders?"" Mynheer explained the conflict began with a quarrel between John Lyon and Gilbert Mahew. Lyon, favored by the earl, caused anger among the citizens by killing a man. Lyon fled to Douay but was later pardoned and made ruler of ships. This angered many, including Mahew, who convinced the earl to appoint him instead. Lyon, patient, saw his chance when Bruges threatened Ghent's trade.

On the next day, the group departed from Sluys. They presented a strong appearance as Van Voorden had arranged for two well-armed mounted men to accompany the young knights as men-at-arms.

Bringing up the rear were two English men-at-arms and two newly hired men, all equipped with breast-and back-pieces and steel caps. After a brief stay in Bruges, it became clear that the town's trade animosity towards Ghent overshadowed any patriotic sentiments. The group learned that entering Ghent wouldn't be challenging unless they encountered forces preventing foragers from Ghent. The citizens had proven to be fierce fighters, causing the earl to reduce his army, believing the city would succumb to famine.

""If we encounter a strong force, we'll turn back. But if we find food, we'll wait for you to catch up and guard it until the others arrive."" Riding swiftly, the friends soon led by two miles. The villages were deserted, likely due to being between rival cities. They turned off the road and headed across the country. They spotted a few animals and came upon an abandoned mill. ""I'm almost as hungry as those from Ghent,"" one of the men said. They found ten sacks of flour and decided to send for bakers to make bread for the army.

The group had gathered a substantial amount of food and livestock during their travels, providing a feast for the hungry soldiers. They wisely rationed the food to ensure there was enough for the next day. The men worked together to prepare for the impending battle, with clergy offering words of encouragement and blessings. As the enemy approached, the Ghentois set up a defensive position with sharp stakes, ready to defend themselves. When the battle began, they used their strategic advantage to surprise and defeat the enemy forces. Despite being outnumbered, the Ghentois showed great courage and skill in battle, ultimately emerging victorious. The citizens of Bruges, who had anticipated an easy victory, were caught off guard by the fierce resistance of the Ghentois and quickly retreated. The cowardly actions of Louis of Flanders further contributed to the defeat of the Bruges forces. The Ghentois celebrated their hard-won victory, proving that courage and determination can overcome even the most daunting challenges.|"['1.

Great numbers of the flying citizens were killed in the pursuit. It was now dark; the earl on arriving had ordered the gate by which he entered to be closed, and had set twenty men there. Thus the retreat of the citizens into the town was prevented, and many were slaughtered. In consequence, the rest fled to other gates, where they were admitted, but with them rushed in their pursuers. Philip Van Artevelde begged the two English knights to each take a strong party, and to proceed round the walls in different directions, seizing all the gates, and setting a strong guard on them, that none should enter or leave; and then, with the main body of his following, he marched without opposition to the market-place. The earl, when he found that the town was lost and the gates closed, disguised himself, and found shelter for the night in a loft in the house of a poor woman. Van Artevelde had issued the strictest orders that he was on no account to be injured, but was, when found, to be brought at once to him, so that he might be taken to Ghent, and there obliged to make a peace that would assure to the city all its privileges, and give rest and tranquility to the country. In spite, however, of the most rigid search, the earl was not found; but the forty knights and men-at-arms who had entered with him were all captured and killed. No harm whatever was done|"['1.

In the hall, the young knights and their followers waited for Moens to return with the news. When he did, the bells in the city rang, waking everyone. The town poured into the streets, excited by the news. Moens stood with the knights and addressed the crowd, announcing the defeat of the army of Bruges and the arrival of provisions to end the famine.

A loud cheer greeted the two young knights as they returned to town. The crowd rushed towards them, eager to praise their bravery. With some effort, the council members cleared a path for them to a small door. They quickly made their way to Van Voorden's house, where they were warmly welcomed by the Fleming and his family. The knights recounted their escape from the platform and the ongoing search for the captured earl. Despite the joyous atmosphere in town, they remained cautious and only had a light meal after days of scarcity. The city celebrated with bells ringing, flags waving, and bonfires lighting up the streets. The knights, shedding their armor, joined the festivities, marveling at the jubilant scene. The cathedral and churches were packed with grateful worshippers.

The earl displayed cowardice by fleeing without a fight, contrasting with the bravery of the burghers of Bruges. Van Voorden praised the outcome, expecting the news to sway other cities to support them. Despite tensions with Bruges, leniency was promised to most craftsmen. Edgar suggested aiding the council with provisions to alleviate the starving populace. Ghent's victory led to abundant supplies from Damme and Sluys. Van Artevelde's call for Flanders' towns to acknowledge Ghent's supremacy was met with enthusiasm, except by Oudenarde. Ghent's splendor and power grew under Van Artevelde's leadership, prompting a siege on Oudenarde. Despite threats from Burgundy and France, England's support became crucial. The narrative unfolds with alliances, power shifts, and the looming threat of war.|"['1.

The men in the towns are brave in battle but lack the knowledge of laying a siege. The situation seems to drag on with no progress in sight. Instead of focusing on capturing Oudenarde, they are busy with ordinances and contributions for Ghent's honor. Sir Ralph agrees that little has been achieved in the three months of the siege. He advises Edgar and Albert to return to England as there seems to be no hope of progress. The knights agree, feeling they are wasting time. They leave for Sluys and sail back to England.

Two days passed quietly at Oudenarde until news arrived that the French army had halted at the Lys near Comines. Unable to cross the river, some French knights found boats and stealthily crossed with men-at-arms. They hoped the Flemings would leave their position to battle, but the Flemish leader, Peter De Bois, remained firm. The French army spent a night without food or shelter on marshy ground. The next morning, the Flemings, fearing reinforcements, attacked. The French fought back fiercely, causing the Flemings to flee. The French then repaired the bridge and crossed a significant portion of their army. The weather was harsh, and the French suffered. Sir James Pinder suggested fortifying their position, anticipating the French's arrival. However, the Flemings disagreed, believing they could defeat the French in battle.

"""It is just madness,"" Sir James exclaimed to the English knights gathered around him. ""I had hoped the dyke would give us an advantage, but now the Flemings are heading straight into danger like sheep to the shearers. We must rely on our horses' speed for our escape."" Moving through the mist, they spotted French knights scouting ahead and then riding off to warn their army. The French divided into three groups, with one carrying the royal banner to attack the Flemings head-on, while the other two planned to flank them. The French charged, overwhelming the Flemings. The English knights on the right tried to turn their forces but were too late. The Flemings were encircled, struggling to defend themselves.

Sir Edgar and his companions were in a fierce battle against the French knights. Despite the desperate situation, their strong armor protected them from harm. With swift and powerful strikes, Sir Edgar managed to defeat their opponents. Unfortunately, one of their companions was mortally wounded. As they rode away from the battlefield, they saw the French chasing the fleeing Flemings. Sir Eustace and two men-at-arms were severely injured, and a Fleming among them offered to help.

Sir Eustace suggested it would be safer to avoid entering a town to prevent being exposed to the French. They continued their journey and arrived at a wayside inn before heading to Sluys. No news of the battle had reached there yet. The young knights informed a merchant about the disastrous battle of Rosebeque. The merchant expressed relief as he believed the craftsmen of Ghent gaining power would have been harsh. Albert shared their experiences in the battle, mentioning the loss of knights and men-at-arms. The battle was described as chaotic, with the Flemish army lacking leadership. The merchant speculated on the future of Flanders under French control.

Upon your return, Edgar, it would be beneficial for you and my son to train with the lance. It's a noble weapon, and a knight should be skilled in its use. There's a suitable ground nearby for jousting, and I will teach you all I know about it. News from Flanders to England was grim. Thirty-four thousand Flemings were slain after a victory, and towns like Courtray and Bruges suffered pillage and destruction. Ghent resisted the French. Flanders was declared part of France, causing outrage in England. Sir Ralph trained the young knights in jousting, improving their skills. The rivalry between the two popes led to a call for a Holy War, funded by taxing church property. Sir Henry Spencer was chosen to lead the expedition against France. Sir Hugh Calverley agreed to lead the young knights in Flanders, where they gained experience and fought bravely. The knights eagerly awaited the opportunity to campaign under Sir Hugh's leadership.|['1.

The journeys began together, but one moved much faster than the other. The Bishop of Norwich was esteemed and brave, while the Duke of Lancaster was disliked. Many knights joined the bishop eagerly, while few wanted to serve under the duke. Five hundred spearmen and fifteen hundred soldiers joined the bishop's forces. Priests also followed, trading their cassocks for armor like crusaders. They gathered at Calais, waiting for their leaders. The bishop, Sir Hugh Calverley, and two knights swore to fight against Clement's supporters. The king asked them to wait for reinforcements. Sir Robert Gaiton gifted young knights with armor and horses. Edgar and Albert prepared to join Sir Hugh at Dover or Sandwich. Edgar felt uneasy about the war's purpose, questioning the Church's involvement in military matters.|"['1.

"Albert and I share the same view, father. With only two or three thousand men, it's unlikely we can march to Paris and persuade the King of France to support our pope. Nevertheless, we will march in good company and proudly do so under the banner of the esteemed Sir Hugh Calverley.

""I have no objection to that, Edgar. But I would prefer to see you start as knights-errant, always ready to defend damsels in distress. The era of crusades has passed. We've learned that true gains aren't achieved through religious fervor. Men may be inspired to great deeds, but lasting good seldom results. The expedition you're joining seems foolish to me.""

The next day, the two young knights rode to Canterbury, then Dover. The Bishop of Norwich, Sir Hugh Calverley, and other knights arrived, boarding ships to Calais. A month's delay frustrated the eager men. Sir Hugh lamented the lack of war-hardened soldiers, emphasizing the need for patience and obedience. The army was inexperienced and impulsive, lacking the seasoned warriors of previous campaigns like Crécy and Poictiers.

When they reached Gravelines, the bishop denied their plea for safe passage. He stated that the army was not from England but under Pope Urban's command. Although most of Flanders supported Urban, the Lord of Bar, ruling Gravelines, favored Clement. The bishop offered to leave without harm if they acknowledged Pope Urban; otherwise, he threatened to force their submission. The people of Artois, more French than Flemish, took matters into their own hands. Twelve thousand men marched towards Dunkirk and Mardyck. Two young knights agreed with the decision not to engage. The English army, reinforced by knights like Sir Nicholas Clifton, faced the Flemings at Dunkirk. The battle ensued after the Flemings attacked the English herald. The English archers played a crucial role, leading to a victory with minimal losses on their side.|"[""1.

After the English captured Dunkirk, they seized all the seaports up to Sluys. They then marched to Ypres and laid siege to the town, joined by twenty thousand men from Ghent. Many knights and foot-men from England also arrived, attracted by the news of captured spoils. Ypres had a strong garrison, and every assault was repelled. Sir Hugh Calverley led a risky assault, where Edgar and Albert, with archers and men-at-arms, joined the fight. They built a platform to reach the wall and fought fiercely, allowing more Englishmen to climb up. Sir Hugh was wounded, and Edgar helped lower him down the ladder to safety.

The English fought fiercely, driving the enemy back with fresh reinforcements pouring in. English archers shot arrows from the edge of the ditch, causing chaos. Despite gaining ground slowly, Edgar and his party joined forces with Albert, defending him as he was wounded. As the fight raged on, the enemy offered surrender terms to Edgar and his comrades. Edgar, Albert, and their defenders were taken to safety by Sir Robert De Beaulieu, who provided medical aid for Albert's wounds.

When the darkness made it impossible to be seen at a short distance, Edgar, Albert, and Hal climbed to the top of the house. Edgar stood on the sill of the highest dormer window, looking out over the steep roof. It was about twenty feet above the window, making it impossible to stand on. Some houses were much lower, around thirty feet. Edgar thought they could make their way along if they had ropes. He informed Sir Robert, suggesting coming down into an empty or friendly house. Sir Robert mentioned an empty house six doors down. The next day, ropes and grapnels were brought in. Sir Robert confirmed the empty house.

The English army at Crécy, led by a king and filled with skilled fighters and noble knights, faced a different scenario in Flanders. Here, a bishop commanded the army, and many men joined for selfish gains rather than loyalty. Concerns arose about the bishop's delayed arrival, potentially jeopardizing the battle against the French King. The narrative shifted to a man's escape from Ypres due to unsafe conditions after the King of France's victories. The man aimed to establish alliances between Ghent and England but faced challenges due to the bishop's troops' actions. The story unfolded with the man contemplating relocating his family to England permanently. Subsequently, Edgar and Albert's return to De Courcy's castle sparked joy and discussions about their recent battles and injuries.

If you ever become a knight banneret, you'll have land to support your status, riding with knights and men-at-arms. I've ransomed prisoners, but saving a Flemish merchant's life is a unique feat."" Sir Ralph continued, ""Flemings are Europe's bankers, living in luxury. They could pay a king's ransom or a country's taxes. It's no wonder they reward those who save them.
