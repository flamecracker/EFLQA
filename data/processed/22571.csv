When I encountered him, I was unaware that they were not residing together. He compelled me to listen and recounted how he had mistaken a disfigured body from the accident as mine, burying it in my place, convinced of my demise.

No; that is lost. Let me tell you something: There is a group of counterfeiters in this area. They do not distribute their fake money here; most of it ends up in Chicago. Detectives, possibly Secret Service agents, are investigating. Their identities are unknown, but there are rumors that Dan Drake is involved. So far, they have been circulating small denominations, but this fifty-dollar bill is new. Rumors suggest that the leader of this group is a young girl who appears innocent but may be involved in the counterfeiting scheme. The receiving teller's disdain made him realize he might have been deceived by her. He felt a sudden urge to uncover the truth. Frank left the express due to a friend's arrival in Carson.
