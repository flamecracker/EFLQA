""I'm not scared of you,"" Fred retorted, his voice unwavering despite his anger. ""You've deceived me. You've had my passport and money seized. Stranding me in a foreign land at night without a penny? But I'll find a way to retaliate. Anyone who treats me like this must have wronged others.

Useless against Mikail Suvaroff, a Russian prince and friend to powerful figures."" Fred replied, ""You're influential, but that doesn't excuse your actions. You may think I shouldn't have come to Russia, but that doesn't warrant mistreatment. You're my uncle -"" ""Your power ends at the border!"" he interrupted. ""I'm in Germany now.

"""I don't know if you really had the money you claim was taken from you,"" Suvaroff said, trying to stay calm. ""It's easy for you to accuse me, but the officers who detained you say they didn't find any money on you. Your word against theirs holds no weight."" ""Wow! You really despise us--and me!"" he replied slowly. ""I believe you truly think everything you've accused me of! Well, if that's the case, it gives you a reason for treating me this way. I'd hate to think any of my relatives could behave like you unless they believed they were right!"" Fred remained motionless as a few policemen and soldiers in Russian uniforms approached. He knew running or fighting would be futile. However, a young man behind him intervened, ordering German soldiers to step forward. ""I'd regret any conflict,"" the German said calmly. ""My orders are to avoid provoking a war. But I'm not forbidden to defend against Russian aggression. We're ready for war, though we don't seek it."" Fred, now intrigued by this unexpected turn of events, stared at Suvaroff. Witnessing the Russian's reaction, he saw him swallow his pride, remove his hat, and bow to the German officer.

"""In Russia, things are sometimes done this way,"" he explained. ""It's not always the case, but it's possible, especially for a noble. Similar situations can be found in my own country, Prussia. Let me see what I can do to assist you. Once you reach Berlin, your ambassador can provide help, right?"" Suddenly, he declared, ""War has been declared between Germany and Russia! You're in a tough spot, my young friend! The train you were kicked off was the last one heading to Berlin until the mobilization is complete."" With a serious tone, he continued, ""This is just the beginning. We currently have the upper hand. We're taking control of the Russian side of the border station. Unfortunately, Suvaroff may have escaped. The Russians have more troops nearby than we do."" Fred was still in shock, struggling to grasp the reality that the popping of rifles and the calm statements from the German officer signified the start of a war. Ernst assured, ""I intended to lend you the money and allow you to continue to Berlin. Now, I can provide the money, but there are no trains available. You can't stay here.

Fred, a young traveler, embarked on his journey confidently through the hot days and cool nights of the countryside. Determined to cover more ground, he decided to walk at night and rest during the scorching days. The region's short, hot summers and long, cold winters reminded him of East Prussia and parts of Canada, known for breeding horses. As he walked along, he pondered the potential impact of war on the horses bred in the area. Despite encountering signs of human life at dawn, Fred felt a sense of loneliness without his friends as companions.

"Few men were around the village when he entered. He noticed a small group gathered early in the morning near a sign that read ""Kriegzustand!"" signaling mobilization and war. Most men had already responded to the call, except for the elderly who couldn't join immediately. Some older men would also be called for garrison duty so younger men could go to the front lines.

On Sunday and Monday, supplies poured through a small village nonstop. Fred saw German field kitchens baking bread efficiently while on the move. On Tuesday, he was told he could leave as the German army disappeared, except for a few Uhlans. Refreshed, Fred set out that evening. Unaware, England entered the war against Germany. As Fred walked west, he noticed a thickening of the country with aristocratic landholders' homes and lights burning after midnight. The country stirred with officers contributing to the army from these houses. Fred understood the anxiety and saw motorcars carrying women and children west to safety from potential invasion.

The people from the grand houses were moving. The men headed to their military units; the women went to Berlin and other fortresses nearby like Koenigsberg, Danzig, and Thorn. Fred was journeying through historic land, once shaken by Napoleon's army over a century ago. As he walked, he felt tired and hungry despite eating at midnight. The rising sun revealed an old stone house in a village, lacking a flag. Fred's presence raised suspicion among the villagers who mistook him for an Englishman due to the war. Feeling uneasy, he quickly left, realizing the locals were nervous and uninformed without their men around. Fred paid for his meal and continued his journey, wary of the situation.|"['1.

Most soldiers have served their time in the army. The Germans will conscript any able man. This is necessary to prevent the enemy from bolstering their forces. There are strange troop movements in the region, with fewer soldiers than expected. The Austrians are mobilizing across the border, but our focus is keeping the Germans occupied here. Victory isn't crucial now; our goal is to divert German forces from invading France. The speaker emphasizes the importance of stalling the Germans to allow England to prepare.

Fred followed Boris, and in a few minutes found himself in a great room that was obviously the dining-room of the house. In this room there were many pictures, and the walls were panelled in oak, blackened by smoke and age. Boris looked about to make sure that they were not observed, then he touched a spot in one of the panels, and it slid open. Beyond this, however, was revealed an unbroken wall. Again Boris touched a certain spot, and now this wall, seemingly solid and unbroken, gave way, just as the oaken panel had done.

"""Yes,"" he said. ""But it's not the kind of Germans we should worry about. It's just the people from the village. Elderly men, women, and children - boys, obviously. I'm surprised they came, knowing they can't enter."" ""There are soldiers too. They arrived much sooner than expected!"" Boris exclaimed. ""Quick, into that passage! Follow the arrows down.

Fred switched on his torchlight to inspect the warren where he sought refuge. Surprisingly, it was clean and well-maintained, not the dank place he anticipated. The walls were grey and dull, absorbing the light. The arrows, as Boris described, were spaced evenly. Fred felt a sense of connection to the Suvaroff family, realizing he belonged to such a devoted lineage. He marveled at finding Boris, a cousin he never knew existed. Determined to prove himself, Fred pondered on his Russian relatives and the misunderstanding with Prince Suvaroff. He hoped to return to Russia, clear his name, and help the country during the war.

Boris instructed Fred to take charge while he moved to a nearby parsonage through a secret passage. If Ivan returned, Fred was to inform him using the song of the Volga boatmen. Boris emphasized not to reply to avoid detection. Fred, left alone, decided to explore the secret passage to aid Boris. He navigated the passage with the help of arrows and torchlight, marveling at its construction. As he descended, he reached a part leading to the outside.

Fred, a former football player, unexpectedly tackled a young German soldier by instinct, causing him to drop his gun and hit his head. While the soldier lay stunned, Fred observed the surroundings. He noticed a sandy hollow that could fill with water, and a gully leading down into the pit. Assessing the soldier's condition, Fred found him unharmed but unconscious. Despite the risk, Fred decided to move cautiously towards a nearby grey stone house, which he identified as Colonel Goldapp's headquarters.

Fred was in a dilemma about what to do next. He was concerned about the soldier he had accidentally thrown. As he returned, he saw the soldier starting to regain consciousness. The soldier, upon seeing Fred's gun, spoke angrily. Fred struggled to hide his amusement, wondering if the soldier was confused or simple-minded due to the fall. He observed the entrance closely, realizing it was cleverly hidden behind bushes. This gave Fred an idea.

The soldier shook with fear, eyeing Fred suspiciously, thinking he might be behind the eerie voice. Fred, skilled in ventriloquism, had played tricks on family and friends before. The soldier, unaware of such a talent, fled in terror. Fred stifled laughter, slipping away as the soldier ran off. The soldier counted to a hundred, stumbling over the numbers. Fred, hiding, heard the soldier's return. The soldier mumbled to himself about the close encounter, regretting his curiosity. Fred, undeterred, continued down the tunnel, heart racing.

Fred decided not to engage in a lengthy conversation with the Suwalki operator due to concerns about German wireless stations in the area. He was cautious not to reveal the presence of a private Russian station within German territory. Despite the risk of interception, he quickly reported the situation and inquired about Russian army movements. However, the operator had limited information, mentioning troop concentrations and cavalry movements. As the afternoon progressed, Fred grew anxious about Boris's delayed return, suspecting he might be held captive. To navigate safely, Fred disguised himself as a Prussian peasant with Vladimir's help. He sought guidance on accessing the tunnel entrance near the parsonage discreetly.

Fred was amazed by the obedience old Vladimir showed him during their adventure. His mother had always spoken highly of the Suvaroff family and their sense of duty. Despite their power, she warned that families like the Suvaroffs could either do great harm or provide immense service to those around them. Fred noticed the stark contrast in treatment between Boris, himself, and his uncle Mikail Suvaroff's staff. While Mikail inspired fear, Boris's father lacked that devotion. As Fred left the house in disguise, he observed the villagers' murmurs of hostility toward the Suvaroff estate. He set out to find the parsonage, guided by the sun's position and the passing motorcycle. Fred pondered the abundance of dispatch riders, suspecting more significant activities at the colonel's headquarters. Despite his curiosity, his immediate goal was to rendezvous with Vladimir and locate the parsonage undetected.|"[""1.

Fred cautiously scanned the area and then knelt down in the gully where Vladimir awaited him. In under a minute, Vladimir shared the secret of the door. Fred instructed Vladimir to return to the house and either stay near the passage entrance or have someone else stationed there. Fred wasn't sure of the plan yet but felt it crucial to have a trusted person at the house. As Fred observed, there was increased activity with several soldiers and officers in grey uniforms and cars with distinct horns indicating their rank. Despite the commotion, Fred managed to navigate through the area until he was challenged by a soldier. Initially startled, Fred was relieved to not be arrested but noticed the organized chaos inside the house, where everyone seemed to know their tasks amidst the ringing telephones and wired connections. Fred recognized the voice of the captain who had taken Boris, realizing the captain hadn't recognized him in disguise.|"['1.

Fred's tasks were simple; he ran errands and delivered messages around the house. He helped out wherever needed and went unnoticed as a local boy assisting. As he was busy with his chores, he couldn't immediately check if Boris was still in the house. However, an officer eventually instructed him to take a meal tray to Boris's room on the third floor, where a sentry was stationed. Fred was thrilled to see Boris inside the locked room, disguised well enough to not be recognized. Boris shared his plan to escape, signaling Fred with a handkerchief at the window. Fred promised to send a message by wireless and return to aid Boris's escape later.|"[""1.

Fred nodded in understanding and quickly left to prepare the clothes for Boris as requested. As he made his way down with a tray, he encountered a slight delay but managed to convince a sympathetic officer to let him go due to his tiredness and unexpected absence from home. Upon reaching the opening of the tunnel, Fred noticed it was unguarded and relatively safe within the outer line of sentries. He then communicated via wireless with the operator at Suwalki, who initially expressed frustration at the lack of response but was incredulous upon hearing the news Fred shared. Despite sensing the operator's distrust due to German spy activities, Fred remained hopeful that the information would be useful to the Russians. As darkness fell, Fred retrieved the clothing bundle from Vladimir and decided to travel through the tunnel for a safer passage past the sentries. With stealth and caution, he approached Boris's window, ensuring no risks were taken to avoid detection by nearby sentries.|"['1.

There was a risk to think about, which required more time to figure out. A patrol was around the house. Fred had to dodge the guard doing rounds. He hid in the bushes, noting the guards' movements for nearly thirty minutes. There were two guards, meeting at the end of the garden. Luckily, they met where Fred could plan. He mentally mapped their paths and timed them. The guards met at the east end. One walked west, the other north. The one heading west had his back to Fred and Boris's window. Fred observed that they weren't focused on the house but on external threats. After preparing, Fred used a tennis ball with a note tied to it to signal Boris without making noise. He threw it accurately through the window, ensuring Boris could pull up the rope unnoticed by the sentries.|"[""1.

He waited anxiously, the signal was crucial. Three sharp tugs, then the test would begin. The other sentry approached, head down. Fred held his breath, fearing the scheme would be exposed. The man paused as the twine grazed his cheek, but a passing breeze carried it away. One tug signaled Boris to proceed. Fred watched as his cousin climbed up to the roof, hidden momentarily. Another sentry passed, giving Boris the signal to descend. A gunshot rang out, chaos ensued. Despite a near success, disaster struck as a German officer spotted the rope, foiling their plan.|"['1.

Fred and Boris realized the futility of trying to escape as soldiers surrounded them. Despite the chaos, they held onto hope and their fighting spirit. Hiding in a thicket, they stayed still to avoid detection. Suddenly, the noise quieted, and the sound of engines filled the air. Motorcycles and cars rushed past, signaling a change in the situation. General von Hindenburg's departure hinted at grave news. The search for Fred and Boris resumed with renewed vigor, leading to their eventual discovery by diligent searchers.

The German officer accused Fred of being a spy and ordered him to be locked up. Despite the tense situation, Fred remained calm. The officer assured Fred that he would have a fair trial and a chance to defend himself. Meanwhile, Boris, feeling guilty for Fred's predicament, was also taken away.

In the aftermath, he awoke to a Russian man who had helped him and witnessed the aftermath of the fierce battle.

"""Oh, I forgot that is not your custom!"" said Boris. ""But I thought you were dead! I thought they had killed you! I saw them bring you out from my window, and if the sentry had not stopped me, I would have thrown myself out to join you! Come with me--my father is here!""

Fred was still dazed. His escape had been so miraculous that he wanted to pinch himself to see if he were still awake. A month before he had been at home in America, envied by the rest of his patrol because he was actually to go to far-off Russia by himself. And since then he had been three times a prisoner, had been in danger of exile to Siberia, and just now had escaped by mere seconds meeting a blast of bullets from a German firing squad, a victim of a war that had not even been dreamed of when he had sailed from America!

But there could be no real doubt of the truth as he followed Boris into the house. In the dining-room where he had been sentenced to death, he came upon Lieutenant Ernst, chatting amiably with half a dozen Russian officers in their white coats. The German grinned at him.

Ernst only looked wise, and did not answer. Fred was surprised by the way in which captive and captors mingled, seemingly on the most friendly terms. But when he thought it over, it did not seem so strange. Ernst and these Russians knew what a huge thing this war was."|"['1.

"""Yes, more than danger. They are sure to try to do it! But their cavalry is very slow, and I do not believe they have infantry enough nearby to make any trouble for us,"" General Suvaroff said, frowning thoughtfully. ""There is something very peculiar about the whole situation around here! If von Hindenburg is here, it means that their chief concentration on this front must be here. And yet we get reports of an astonishingly small number of troops! Not more than two corps.""

""Father, I want to stay!"" Fred said eagerly. ""It will be safe. I can get back to the house, and they can never catch me there, you know!

"""I believe we will return here with a strong presence before the week ends,"" his father mentioned, pausing briefly. ""Alright, you will remain! Your assistance could be crucial. I cannot prioritize personal matters when Russia's well-being is in jeopardy."" The sun had risen, illuminating the scene. Despite the chaos in the garden and the house, with shattered windows and broken furniture from the recent conflict with the Cossacks, the sounds of roosters crowing and birds singing filled the air outside. General Suvaroff issued a command, which was relayed down the line. A bugle call echoed, and shortly after bidding farewell to the two scouts, the Cossack raiders departed in formation. Observing from an upper window of the deserted parsonage, Fred and Boris saw the villagers watching as the raiders passed through the village. Through Boris's field glass, they could discern the expressions on the faces of the observing Germans, filled with a blend of hatred and fear towards the invaders. ""Indeed,"" remarked the Russian.

Fred quickly sent a message via the wireless detailing General von Hindenburg's escape and the German forces' plan to join the Austrians for an advance from Cracow. Ivan, appearing excited, added crucial information, cautioning against haste. He emphasized the need for rested horses for potential combat and suggested motorcycles for speed. Ivan's demeanor, a mix of admiration and fear, hinted at his formidable character. He warned Fred and Boris of imminent danger, advising them to avoid German detection and use a tunnel in emergencies. Ivan's departure left Fred and Boris with a challenging task - waiting vigilantly in a turret room with Vladimir and others standing guard below.|"['1.

"From the tall tower where the signals were sent out into the sky, there was a clear view of the land for miles around. The area was mostly flat with gentle slopes and few high points. The roads looked like thin ribbons from up there, like lines on a map. Fred turned on the wireless and tuned in, hearing a mix of sounds at first. After adjusting the settings, he caught a clear message in Morse code. ""I'll jot this down,"" he told Boris. ""It's all in German, but it might come in handy if we crack their code."" Boris took over, and Fred scanned the horizon with binoculars. He spotted a group of civilians with carts, not soldiers. They were evacuating, a precaution against being caught in the crossfire. Uhlans, a cavalry unit, passed by, signaling the start of an evacuation. Fred had a gut feeling that Ivan, a character they knew, was being deceived. He saw troops on two roads nearby, a detail that didn't align with the situation Ivan believed in."|"['1.

Fred decided not to disclose his plan to Boris and instructed him to eavesdrop at the thin wall. Concerned about being overheard, Fred stealthily made his way to the other end of the tunnel to ascertain the origin of the Uhlans. Justifying his actions to himself, Fred hoped to leave before Boris returned. As he exited the door, Fred felt the familiar thrill of breathing fresh air. Observing the village from a hidden spot, he noticed the Uhlans departing, leaving the village nearly deserted. Fred pondered how Americans might react in a similar situation. Relieved by the villagers' departure, he observed the Uhlans at the Suvaroff house before they eventually left. Despite his nerves, Fred was relieved when the Uhlans departed without discovering Boris's hiding place.|"['1.

It was time to test his plan. Success seemed unlikely, and the risk was high. Fred knew the danger of being recognized by the Uhlans. Yet, he boldly followed their path northeast, part of his strategy. Soon, a shout and galloping hoofs approached. A Uhlan demanded Fred to stop, but he pretended to be deaf and mute. The officer, puzzled, wrote questions in German. Fred, nervous but brave, responded in German, trying to mimic a native speaker's handwriting. The officer, unaware of Fred's true identity, directed him back. Fred played along, turning back and forth, maintaining his act. Despite the tension, he managed to keep a straight face, concealing his amusement.|"[""1.

"""My name is Gebhardt,"" he wrote. ""I come from Munich, and I am visiting my uncle and aunt here at Gumbinnen. My uncle sent me to Insterberg and then I found I could not go back by train. Soldiers have made me turn around so many times that it has taken me all this time to get here. Why can I not go to Gumbinnen?""

Fred caught his breath. He was getting what he wanted now, certainly! If only he did not betray himself! If the officer would only go on and tell him a little more! And he did go on, almost as if he were speaking to himself.

""If his people have any sense, they will have cleared out of Gumbinnen before this. He knows someone at Insterberg, perhaps, but if it is the plan to let the Russians come so far without fighting and then strike while they are there, the population will have been ordered out. And they have been unloading troop trains at Insterberg, too--so that the Russians would not find out how many men we had here. Eh--take him up behind you, Schmidt! We can't abandon him. Perhaps the hospital people or the cooks can make some use of him.""

Fred found himself in a challenging situation, riding with Schmidt and five other mounted men. As darkness fell, Fred's discomfort grew, but a clever idea dawned on him. Schmidt's tired horse lagged behind, giving Fred an opportunity. With a subtle move, Fred cut the saddle girth, knowing any strain would break it. Schmidt, unaware, relied heavily on his horse. Fred observed Schmidt's rhythmic breathing, indicating his drowsiness. Seizing the moment, Fred waited for the right time to act on his plan.|"[""1.

As the evening darkened, Fred tested his plan. He tossed a handkerchief, startling the horse. The horse bolted, throwing Fred and Schmidt off. Schmidt chased the horse, leaving Fred a chance to grab a revolver from the fallen saddle. He waited as Schmidt fixed the girth, then swiftly mounted the horse. Ignoring Schmidt's shouts, Fred spurred the horse away. Schmidt, surprised by the empty holster, could only watch as Fred rode off. Fred's quick thinking and courage helped him escape on the horse, outwitting Schmidt's attempts to stop him.|"['1.

Fred felt a wave of regret wash over him. He worried about Schmidt's fate, knowing the strictness of the German army. But he couldn't dwell on sentimentality. Fred had taken risky chances himself, seizing any opportunity to escape. His freedom and perhaps his life depended on it. He realized the war's outcome hinged on accurate information. Fred observed the Russians lacked effective spies, surprised by their lack of initiative. The Germans, on the other hand, utilized aerial scouts. Spotting General Suvaroff, the scout thwarted von Hindenburg's capture plan. Fred hoped Schmidt could concoct a convincing alibi and prayed to avoid more German soldiers. Spotting a German military car, Fred's horse spooked, throwing him off and fleeing. Fred quickly recovered, evading capture by darting into a field. He sprinted away, hoping to outpace his pursuers.|"['1.

He had two chances, he pondered. Maybe he hadn't been spotted at all, or perhaps the person in the car assumed he had moved on with the flying horse. Running wasn't an option if he had been seen. Exhausted from the previous night's events and the open space ahead, fleeing was futile against a bullet. After a brief sprint, he halted, laying low to observe and listen. Initially safe as the car sped past, a change in engine noise signaled its return. Though tempted to flee, he resisted, anticipating the car's search. The car approached slowly, stopping near his hiding spot. The blinding headlight obscured his view, granting them an upper hand. As footsteps neared, he readied the pistol, considering a warning shot for a chance to escape. Just then, a voice called out from the darkness.|"['1.

They abandoned Gumbinnen without a fight and regrouped in a half circle behind. With fewer troops but a daring strategy, they concentrated their forces at one point, leaving the south unguarded. The key is to outflank them, not as they expect on their right, but on their extreme left. A small force will remain at Gumbinnen while the main troops rush from Grodno to encircle the enemy.

Boris expressed his acceptance of the situation, mentioning the importance of their mission for Russia. Both Boris and Fred, unfamiliar with the car, took a moment to familiarize themselves with its controls before setting off. Fred took the wheel, suggesting they take turns driving and rest when needed. As they drove through the deserted countryside, the eerie silence contrasted with the distant sounds of battle. Fred found the empty houses and fields reminiscent of stories of past plagues, where people fled, leaving behind a desolate landscape.

They had many miles ahead. After a couple of hours, Fred and Boris switched seats. Fred rested but stayed alert as they neared the critical part of their journey. The sound of a train whistle warned them of the danger ahead. They saw fires and dark figures along the railway. Fred sounded a bugle to avoid suspicion.

Fred and Boris were in a rush as they raced towards a crucial spot, a dark culvert with soldiers watching. The car sped faster as they approached, the headlight shining on the figures ahead. Fred knew they had to pass under the culvert swiftly to avoid suspicion. Despite the steep descent and unknown road, they couldn't slow down. They had to maintain speed to prevent the soldiers from questioning their presence. As they neared the culvert, Fred sounded the bugle to distract the soldiers. The car swayed dangerously, but they couldn't stop. The officer on watch would be curious about their sudden appearance on the deserted road. With Ivan's warning in mind, they had to dash past the culvert without hesitation to ensure their safety.|['1.

As they sped through the shadows, Fred and Boris caught a glimpse of curious faces peering down from above. Dust-covered from their journey, they knew their appearance didn't match that of officers. An approaching turn heightened their anxiety. Boris struggled to control the car, but a massive van wreck blocked their path. With a deafening crash, the car collided, flames erupting from the wreck. Fred and Boris were flung onto the roadside, shaken but alive.|"['1.

Fred was shocked by his fall but unharmed, unlike Boris, who lay injured near the burning car. Boris urged Fred to escape to the Russian lines alone to avoid capture in German uniform. Despite Boris's broken leg, he insisted Fred leave to save them both. Reluctantly, Fred agreed, knowing staying would only endanger Boris further. As the sound of approaching men grew louder, Fred realized he had to act fast. With a heavy heart, he took Boris's coat and helmet, leaving his friend behind to face the consequences of their crashed car.

Fred hurried to move Boris off the road, despite Boris's pain from a broken leg. Fred knew he had to act quickly as he had decided to flee. He didn't have time to assess Boris's injury or provide first aid. Fred, being a well-trained Boy Scout, understood basic bandaging principles but couldn't attend to Boris due to the imminent arrival of the Germans. He believed the Germans would assist Boris. Fred then hid in a pit near the road, covered by bushes, to observe the Germans. The soldiers found Boris, and their officer was surprised by his condition.|"[""1.

"""That man is not a German officer!"" he exclaimed. He leaned over again, and Fred winced as he watched him shake Boris by the shoulder. Fred questioned if Boris was pretending or truly unconscious. It became evident that Boris was not faking. The officer, in a gentle manner, lifted Boris's head and gave him some spirits from a flask. Fred noticed his cousin tense up; he was regaining consciousness. The officer then laid him down, using a cushion as a pillow that had been thrown out of the overturned car. ""I am unsure. I was walking on the road when the car stopped. A man told me to get in and lie low. We drove fast, then there was a crash, and I was thrown out,"" Boris explained. The German officer assessed Boris's injury and decided to provide immediate aid until they found a surgeon.

Fred breathed a sigh of relief. He had made the right choice to stay hidden. As he watched the soldiers search for the imaginary officers, he knew he had avoided trouble. The officer decided to take Boris back with them for questioning. The sergeant grumbled about the mysterious situation. Fred, feeling exhausted and sore from the car wreck, decided to make a run for the Russian outposts. As he approached the fires signaling safety, he encountered German Uhlans. Panicked, he ran, hoping the Russians were close.|['1.

Fred found himself in a dangerous situation as he heard the whistling of bullets overhead, realizing he was under fire. He quickly sought cover in the bushes, knowing it was safer than staying out in the open. As the Uhlans closed in on him, a sudden firefight erupted between the Uhlans and the Russians. Just when things seemed dire, charging Cossacks arrived, turning the tide of the battle in Fred's favor. Amidst the chaos, Fred cautiously emerged from his hiding spot, waving a white flag to signal his surrender to the Russian rescuers. Initially mistaken for a German, Fred narrowly avoided being attacked by a Cossack before an officer intervened, allowing Fred to explain his situation and seek refuge among his allies.|"['1.

"""I'm afraid I do,"" said Fred, a bit ruefully. He could imagine, even though he could not see himself, that the Russian was quite right. He was caked with dirt. In the fall from the automobile, as he had discovered while he was walking away from the wreck, he had sustained a nasty cut over the eye, which, though it was not painful, had bled a good deal. And this had made his appearance even worse than it had been before. His clothes were torn, too.

""Not with this force. And I should not dare to go so far without special orders,"" said the officer. ""We could not charge the culvert, and, approaching it from this side, we should have to ride uphill. But I am sure that when those in command know your story, a force will be sent to rescue Prince Boris. Come with us now. I will get you a horse if you are able to ride.

Fred, a soldier, had returned safely from the fighting around Gumbinnen, where he showed bravery like the famous Skobeleff.

"The Russian chuckled, his laugh carrying a hidden meaning. Fred, too weary to notice, asked, ""Who commands the troops?"" After a moment's wait, he was led inside, where he faced Mikail Suvaroff, a general. A chilling silence fell as Mikail's eyes met Fred's. Initially not recognizing his nephew, Mikail's gaze turned to one of cold hatred. ""Yes, general,"" acknowledged the lieutenant who had saved Fred, puzzled by the situation.

Fred embarked on an early journey to Grodno, a key point for the Russian army. Traveling in an empty motor truck, once used for supplies, he observed the Russian military mobilizing. Witnessing the overwhelming Russian forces, Fred grasped the direness of his situation. The roads teemed with troops, hospital and provision trains, and artillery, readying for a fierce assault on German forces. Unlike the orderly German movements, the Russian advance showcased chaos and destruction. Fred, realizing his pivotal role in altering Russian plans, ironically faced imprisonment. Despite his grim fate, he harbored a secret desire for Russia's victory. Treated decently by his guards, Fred attributed the humane treatment to Lieutenant Sazonoff, not the formidable General Suvaroff. Upon reaching Grodno, Fred encountered a bustling military presence, with incessant noise signaling the imminent action.|"['1.

"""You'll be condemned, of course,"" he said. ""Prince Mikail knows you are a spy. I think you're very lucky that he didn't hang you outside of his own headquarters! Better plead guilty. It will save time for everyone.""

But Fred refused. Hopeless as the case was, he was still determined to take every chance there was, and to fight for every minute of delay. But the proceedings were soon over. The charge against him was read so quickly that he could scarcely follow it. He was allowed to speak for himself, but none of the officers of the court paid any attention to him. The verdict was quickly found. And the president of the court was just about to pronounce sentence when there was an interruption.

Into the room strode a man at whose entrance every officer started to his feet, saluting. The newcomer jerked his hand to his forehead, answering the salute, and then stood staring about. Fred had never seen such a figure. The man was a giant. He wore a khaki uniform. He was nearly seven feet tall, but he was so magnificently formed that it was only the way he towered over even the tall Russian officers about him that his great height was apparent. Fred knew him at once. It was the Grand Duke Nicholas.
