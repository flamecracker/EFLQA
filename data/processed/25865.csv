Mr. Hepworth, familiar with the play, noticed Patty's struggle during her speech. Concerned, he urged Dr. Martin to go backstage as Patty neared her breaking point.

"Breakfast at Pine Branches was a leisurely affair the next morning, contrary to Roger's joke about ""shredded whisk brooms."" Patty got to know the Warner family better over the delightful meal. The estate was vast, with a brook, grove, golf grounds, and tennis court, offering plenty of activities for its residents. Bertha introduced a young bear they cared for, soon to be sent to the zoo. The girls dressed the bear in a playful outfit, capturing the fun with a camera. They shared many laughs over the bear's antics, lightening the mood. Elise, a bit older and more formal, engaged in conversation with Winthrop, a student interested in scientific studies.

Miss Aurora Bender warmly greeted Bertha Warner and her city friends, inviting them into her cozy kitchen-dining room.

Miss Bender quickly distributed the sewing supplies among the girls for their quilting bee. Elise, skilled with the needle, sewed neatly while Patty did fairly well. However, poor Bertha struggled as she was unfamiliar with sewing. As they worked, they chatted about the upcoming party. The days at Pine Branches passed quickly with Patty regaining her health and enjoying various activities. Guests came and went, including Mr. Phelps and Roger. Surprisingly, Patty overheard a quarrel between Bertha and Winthrop. But to everyone's surprise, they entered hand in hand, revealing it was all a prank for a phonograph recording.

The quilt was a labor of love, carefully pieced together by the guests. Mrs. Quimby, an elderly lady, shared her quilting wisdom with Patty.

For the next course, a selection of preserves and cake was served uniquely. Miss Aurora proudly presented an array of preserves and an impressive fourteen types of cake, each in its own basket or platter. The guests were intrigued by this elaborate display. The conversation was refined, and the ladies ate delicately, with proper etiquette. Patty, quick to adapt, selected her cake with grace.

The cellar, recently white-washed, was transformed into a cozy sitting-room with wicker chairs and sofas. A white floor-cloth, originally for dancing, covered the floor.

Patty surveyed their surroundings, noting the absence of any houses nearby. She faced a decision: wait for someone who might know about the abandoned baby or take the child home for the night. Convinced the baby had been deserted, Patty refused to leave her behind. As the baby started crying loudly, the family realized they had grown attached to her.
