The Chinese ruled their own land until 1644 when the emperor was killed by his own people. The Tartars then took over Peking, despite the Great Wall, and established the current dynasty.

Tientsin is a crowded city in the East, with simple homes for locals, but the foreign area is well-constructed and bright. The boys observed this from a hill. The man from the Secret Service doubted Ned's capability to reach Tientsin. However, Ned succeeded, earning the message himself. Riding motorcycles through the ancient city, they faced some curious onlookers but made decent progress, partly due to the officer's uniform. Reaching the telegraph office, Ned hoped for instructions from Washington. The operator eyed them suspiciously, sending a boy to deliver a message. They were led to a room with a warm stove.

Ned pondered these questions with no answers in sight. Observing the detective's reluctance to send him to prison, Ned found courage. He swiftly made a move, toppling the assistant manager and evading the detective's grasp. The American consul, Dressler-Archibald Hewitt Dressler, appeared reassuring and confident. Amid the tension, Ned scrutinized the consul's unwavering demeanor. The room filled with onlookers, including a man with a scar on his cheek whom Ned recognized from his past. Just as the detective attempted to darken the room to aid the operator's escape, chaos erupted. Hans swiftly incapacitated the detective, and a swarm of Chinese men emerged.

"An interruption occurred just in time to prevent a potential conflict. Ned observed the crowd dispersing as motorcycles approached, diffusing the tense situation instantly. The marines' weapons calmed the natives and the telegraph office workers, averting violence. The consul welcomed an investigation, curious about the motives behind withholding a cablegram. Ned clarified that Captain Martin had been detained for his actions. The consul advised them to head to Peking promptly, warning of possible obstacles along the way. Grateful for the consul's help, Ned planned to share the night's events with the State department upon returning to Washington.

Ned explained how Jimmie found Hans in a room off the court, where they planned their next moves. The mystery remained about how Hans got to the Tientsin house. They needed to leave immediately, wondering about the whereabouts of Jack and Frank. The officer shared that the boys had left in the night, probably to explore Tientsin. The consul assured they would find them. It was concerning that the boys had disregarded instructions and warnings to stay together. Ned encountered a Boy Scout from Boston looking for the boys. He showed him where they had stayed, and the scout joined them. Ned saw the trio head towards the city, respecting their decision not to interfere.|['1.

Hans hopped onto a motorcycle just like the others. The bike lurched forward, tipping over and sending Hans crashing to the ground. As the boys laughed, Hans got up, but the machine slid down a slope, startling him. Despite this, they set off for Peking. The city streets were quiet, showing signs of age and decay. Passing through, they saw old buildings and dim lights. Watchmen eyed them warily as they rode by. The journey felt like a ride through a cemetery, awakening the surroundings briefly. Approaching Tientsin at dawn, the road came to life with locals starting their day. The sun rose, promising a hot day ahead. The boys paused for a break, enjoying coffee in a shaded grove.

Ned interrupted, expressing the department's tough challenge. The delicate matter rules out foreign involvement in the conspiracy against Uncle Sam. The focus shifts to identifying the active power's tools. The search isn't in Washington, Tientsin, or the American embassy in Peking, but on the road. The aim is to thwart those hindering the agent's progress. This detective tactic involves letting suspects escape to reveal their accomplices. The officer suspects Taoist priests, unpopular in China, with a possible nearby temple. Taoism, akin to Buddhism, involves mystical practices. They may be disguised foreigners seeking profit. The group's instruments hint at their identity. If time allows, witnessing their rituals could provide insights.|"[""1.

"As the four oddly dressed figures crossed the field towards the grove, Jimmie hurried over with an egg sandwich and coffee. The hot liquid spilled on his hand as he ran. ""I got the only hot cup!"" he exclaimed. ""Those visitors of yours look like they're from Pell Street. What do you know about them?"" The priests, if that's what they were, entered the grove without acknowledging anyone and stood in a line near Ned and the Captain. Ned spoke to them in Chinese, but got no immediate response. One of the priests, with a star on his gown, stepped forward in front of Ned. Ned felt this was a test of his courage. They all decided to go to the ruined temple with the priests to learn about Eastern mysticism. Ned thought about arresting the priests, but without proof of their conspiracy, he hesitated. The temple was in ruins, with only a stone staircase leading down into darkness. The place was eerie and abandoned, showing no signs of recent use."|"['1.

In a quiet cornfield near Tientsin, Frank and Jack were startled awake by the sound of a drum and fife. A delivery boy appeared, informing them about a cablegram. They rushed to the telegraph office, dodging guards along the way. Despite the rain, they reached a mud shack where they found an old woman drugged and a mysterious face peering through a hole. The boy explained he needed his telegraph messenger uniform to move freely in the city. Frank suspected a trap but the boy assured them it wasn't about money.

The boys descended a steep ladder, securing both doors behind them, and found themselves in the cellar. Frank used his flashlight to explore and discovered a hole in the wall leading downward towards the river. As they entered a square underground room near the hut's wall, they realized they were trapped. Another Chinaman appeared in the tunnel, prompting them to guard the exit. They were far from the camp and underground, making it hard to call for help. The Captain ordered marines to surround the temple, suspecting danger.

Ned found himself in a tight spot. He had to make a quick decision - fight his way out or find a hidden passage to escape. He decided to attack the man blocking his way and tried to disarm him. The room was filled with chaos as the sounds of conflict grew louder. The diplomat was desperately looking for an escape route when Ned leaped at him. Despite the man's attempts to break free, Ned's strength and skill kept him in control. As they struggled, a group of Chinamen barged into the room, causing a commotion.

Five minutes later, troubling sounds were heard from the tunnel leading to the chamber. There were sounds of fighting, grunts, and angry shouts. Soon, the familiar voice of Hans was heard. His flushed face appeared at the tunnel's entrance, followed by his bulky figure tumbling into the chamber. After a moment of confusion, Hans spotted Frank and Jack, bringing relief to all. Hans shared his story, hinting that their friends were likely on their way to Peking, where help awaited them. However, Jack, hungry and frustrated, questioned the usefulness of waiting for assistance from the American ambassador. The boys were considering a bold move once the city woke up, hoping to catch the attention of the authorities. Sandy, feeling responsible for their situation, quietly devised a plan to help his friends escape. He cautiously made his way through the tunnel towards the cellar of the mud house, where he found the guards asleep from opium use.

All the boys quickly sprang into action when Captain Martin was instructed to move his men away from the danger zone.

"""No, not to the embassy,"" Ned responded. ""I have nothing important to share with the ambassador yet. I can only say that we are here, we had many challenges on the way from Taku, but all the opportunities slipped away."" ""Oh my!"" Jack exclaimed. ""You shouldn't risk being out in the open until you can bring diplomats to the embassy! You can't do it alone. This isn't New York, it's a town where a foreigner's life isn't valued.""

In his dark room, Ned waited for a sign of the cut through the stile. He had spent the day planning with a man from the police bureau, feeling confident in his near-perfect plans. As midnight approached, footsteps rushed by his door, and the gnawing sound resumed. Ned smiled at the crude attempts to enter his room, contrasting it with New York thieves using skeleton keys. Looking out the window, he saw the once-signaling panes dark. Facing him in the corridor were six Chinamen and stern-faced policemen. Frank, Jack, and Jimmie struggled to enter the room, followed by more boys and policemen with guns. Captain Martin entered, surprised by the scene. Ned revealed the disguised man's true identity, leading to his capture. The room cleared, leaving only the handcuffed prisoners, the boys, and Captain Martin.|['1.
