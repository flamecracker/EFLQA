Jack Lumley and I were close friends. Lumley, a robust and warm-hearted fellow, enjoyed the comfort of warmth but often spoke passionately about his love for sleeping in a snow-bed. Despite our quiet and undemonstrative natures, we shared a unique bond that drew us together, especially during our hunting trips. Lumley, being taller and stronger, always led the way through the deep snow using snow-shoes. These expeditions were challenging, requiring us to navigate through the wilderness where the snow could be several feet deep. As we trekked through the pine-wood and swampland, the frozen river near our outpost, Fort Dunregan, appeared like a vast plain of ice. Despite the bitter cold, the beauty of the snow-covered landscape under the brilliant sun made our expeditions unforgettable.|['1.

"Whispering ""Ptarmigan!"" I pointed to a knoll ahead where dozens of snow-white creatures stood, surprised. Their plumage camouflaged them, only sparkling eyes and wing tips stood out. Quickly, we aimed our guns, shooting the birds. In that land, hunting was for food and sport, making the most of our ammunition. The woods echoed with gunshots as a cloud of white birds flew up. As night fell, we reached a snowy mound with spruce firs. We were exhausted from walking twenty miles, laden with gear. Despite the eerie surroundings, we cleared a space in the snow, built a snow chamber, and lit a fire. The blazing fire transformed the darkness into light, bringing warmth and comfort to our weary bodies."|"['1.

"Our snow cave transformed into a dazzling spectacle with walls glittering like diamonds, pine branches shining vivid green, and tree trunks resembling red-hot pillars. The overhead canopy seemed solid with light, contrasting the ebony blackness around us. Lumley, savoring tea and pemmican by the fire, playfully called Max a ""gross creature."" Max, feeling offended, blamed the cold for numbing his intellect. Lumley explained that grossness lies in overeating without exertion. In the midst of their banter, a mishap with burnt bird and spilled tea occurred. Lumley, resourceful, replenished the tea by melting snow while Max prepared another bird for supper.

Lumley and I settled down for the night in the frozen wilderness of the Great Nor'-west. We wrapped ourselves in blankets to keep warm as we gazed at the stars above. Our conversation turned serious, discussing the grandeur of creation and the Creator. We talked about God, redemption, and sin, then drifted to thoughts of home and civilized lands. As exhaustion set in, Lumley's discourse on grossness was interrupted by my feigned snoring, and we both drifted off to sleep. The next morning, we found a sledge track in the snow, a surprising discovery in our remote outpost, far from civilization. Our isolated life without newspapers or regular communication with the outside world made us yearn for news from home during the long intervals between mail deliveries.|"['1.

Our leader, Mr. Strang, and us, along with another clerk named Spooner, and most of our companions, hailed from our homeland, leaving loved ones behind. The anticipation of the brief respite from the six months of isolation was palpable. Only those enduring extreme solitude, like convicts, might grasp our longing. Our hearts raced as we stumbled upon the tracks of two messengers who traversed vast distances to bring news. The footprints were distinct, made by two robust individuals equipped for the arduous task. As we unpacked the precious cargo, our chief teased us with a deliberate unpacking, revealing letters from home. The men were treated to a feast, and I delivered their letters, then retreated to savor the news in solitude.|['1.

In our residence known as Bachelors' Hall, we had a strong tradition of playing practical jokes, which was usually enjoyable but could sometimes be inconvenient. To prevent mishaps, we would retreat to our rooms and lock the doors, as the locks were not always reliable. One evening, as I was reading in bed to keep warm, a sudden shout interrupted me. Lumley and Spooner were discussing family matters excitedly, and the conversation became so entangled that we couldn't distinguish one family from another. Our large cast-iron stove, meant to keep us warm, ended up overheating due to Lumley's exuberance with the firewood, causing a chimney fire. Salamander, our Indian helper, quickly intervened to extinguish the flames and put an end to our jovial confusion.|"[""1.

During a thrilling episode, I became aware of the serious risk of a fire in the chimney of a wooden house. With the help of my friends, we hurriedly tossed out the belongings from Bachelors' Hall into the snow. As the men gathered around the source of the trouble to warm up, I noticed for the first time a black mark on Blondin's nose. Previously handsome, it now appeared red, swollen, and misshapen. Laughing it off, Blondin and the others left to tend to his nose, while we cleaned up. Winter in the Arctic, with its endless snow and ice, was a stark contrast to the green fields and flowers we once knew. The scent of roses and other plants was a distant memory, replaced by the dominance of white and grey. Lumley, sensing the end of winter, remarked on the rising temperatures and softer snow, signaling the approach of spring.|"[""1.

The Native American, with snow-covered attire and a cautious demeanor, entered the Highlander's home. His rugged clothes showed signs of a long journey. After placing his gear aside, he sat by the stove without accepting a chair. It's customary for Native Americans to share important news only after having a smoke or meal. Macnab, aware of this, waited for the right moment. The Native American, named Big Otter, shared news of a distant land rich in furs. Macnab decided to visit headquarters to discuss this opportunity. The next morning, they set off on a sled with dogs. The day was frosty and calm, reflecting Macnab's anticipation to meet new people.

The Indian and the white man were caught up in a wild chase after four wolf-like dogs on a vast snowy plain. The dogs, driven by a sudden frenzy, engaged in a chaotic brawl, causing a tumultuous mess. Big Otter, the Indian, stepped in with his whip to restore order, eventually calming the dogs. The group then settled down for the night, clearing a space in the snow, lighting a fire, and preparing a meal. As they sat by the fire, Macnab pondered whether dogs envied humans for their comfort, especially when enjoying a smoke.

Big Otter felt very heavy and stiff, as if weighed down by bags of shot. His joints wouldn't budge, and food no longer appealed to him. He had a strong urge to drink the river, and his head felt like it was being squeezed by an evil spirit. His eyes were swollen, and his nose had doubled in size. The Highlander speculated that Big Otter had pushed himself too hard, hunting and fighting before the right time. The Indian listened intently to the Highlander's lecture on the dangers of strong drink, showing his interest through his expressions and eyes. As they settled down to sleep side by side, a change in the weather brought snowfall that covered them completely.

One day, while journeying through the snow-covered woods, Macnab, a Highlander, and Big Otter, an Indian, faced unexpected challenges. As they trudged through the deep snow, Macnab led the way on his long snow-shoes. The heavy snowfall made progress slow and arduous, especially for Macnab, who had to beat the track for the others.

The man and his companions ventured forward, but a hidden rock caused him to stumble and break his snowshoe. Repairing it was tough and time-consuming. They had to return to the shelter of the woods.

When Big Otter helped me get back on my feet, I was relieved to find that I was unharmed. However, our tin kettle was in a sorry state after being knocked almost flat. In our attempts to fix it, we ended up creating a big hole at the bottom, making it impossible to use for boiling water. We had to say goodbye to hot meals unless we roasted them. We managed to melt snow to get drinking water by sealing the hole, but boiling water was out of reach. While our visitor discussed business with Mr. Strang, we retreated to Bachelors' Hall to chat about the unexpected visit and analyze Macnab and Big Otter. Lumley's prediction of a change in the weather came true as a thaw began, melting the snow and ice, turning the landscape into liquid. The echoes of our laughter and songs filled Bachelors' Hall, bringing joy and companionship after a long period of solitude.|"['1.

The song sung by Macnab was filled with determination and courage, urging everyone to face their fate with a brave heart in the world of Ice and Snow. The atmosphere seemed to respond to his words as a loud noise echoed, signaling the breaking of the ice. The river, once frozen solid, now showed signs of strain due to the melting snow. The ice began to crack and shift, creating a spectacle of nature's power. Masses of ice rose and fell, crashing against each other in a chaotic dance. Eventually, the ice broke apart, sending massive chunks downstream towards the distant lake. After the ice breakup, a message arrived at Fort Dunregan, assigning Mr. Lumley to establish an outpost in the far north, a region previously visited by Macnab's friend Big Otter. Lumley was chosen for his steady and self-reliant nature, ready to embark on this challenging expedition with wisdom and strength.|"['1.

I was thrilled at the opportunity that lay ahead. The thought of exploring unknown lands has always stirred something within me, akin to the spirit of an explorer. I have a deep passion for visiting new places, even the most obscure corners. The chance to be the second in command for a trading-post expedition to a little-known area filled me with self-satisfaction. Having my friend Jack Lumley as the leader was a stroke of incredible luck. My father once advised me to always look up and observe the world around me, warning against being self-absorbed and absent-minded. He encouraged me to cultivate a spirit of curiosity and exploration. His words resonated with me, and I have since been fortunate to accompany exploratory missions worldwide. My skill in sketching landscapes and mapping territories has been a valuable asset on these expeditions.

The campsite was a peaceful spot surrounded by trees and bushes, with a view of a shimmering lake as the sun set. After a long journey through the wilderness, crossing rivers and lakes, the group finally arrived in uncharted territory. Lumley and his companions, including the guide Big Otter and the interpreter Salamander, prepared for the evening by lighting a fire and cooking supper. As they enjoyed their meal, a distant thunderstorm approached, and soon lightning lit up the sky followed by deafening thunder.

When the thunder-clap shook the earth, we quickly prepared for the storm. A majestic pine tree shielded us as we covered our supplies and blankets with oiled-cloths. As the rain began, we sought shelter under the tree, but the downpour was too swift. The rain beat down relentlessly, creating streams and pools around us. The storm intensified with thunder and a whirlwind that tore our oiled-cloth away. I clung to a small tree as debris flew past. The chaos subsided as suddenly as it began, leaving a scene of destruction. Lumley, our composed leader, directed us to assess the damage.

Consider this scenario: we find ourselves far from civilization, with dense forests and no roads around us. Without a boat, we are stuck, unable to move forward or backward. Traveling by foot would mean crossing numerous streams and rivers, risking freezing in the winter. Leaving our supplies behind would be a waste. However, my friend proposes solutions. He suggests building canoes from birch trees, using portable rafts to cross streams, and setting up shelters at our destination. Even if our boat is damaged, we could salvage goods and plan for winter. Adapting to challenges, we could send for help or stay put until conditions improve. Despite potential mishaps, we remain hopeful as we encounter a serene lake, inspiring us to sing and navigate the river's rapids with caution.|"['1.

Our team of explorers swiftly returned with news that the rapids, while challenging, were navigable. We soon found ourselves amidst them, rushing down with what might have appeared dangerously fast speed to the inexperienced eye. The river was approximately a hundred yards wide at that spot, with a rugged channel and a clear, deep, and winding path in the middle. The surges on both sides indicated rocks near the surface, marked by black edges breaking the water into foam. Our leader cautioned Blondin, the bowman, as we narrowly avoided a treacherous ledge. With Henri Coppet's skilled steering, we maneuvered past the danger. Our relief was short-lived as we faced another peril, realizing we were committed downstream. Despite the tension, we relied on our guides' expertise to navigate the turbulent waters. Our boat narrowly averted disaster when Blondin's pole got stuck, but we managed to stay afloat. After a challenging night of battling mosquitoes in the swampy region, we found solace in reaching the calm lake where the river flowed.|"['1.

"Using the provided vocabulary list, here is a rewritten English educational passage for middle school students:

Utilizing the incredible ability we have to transport our minds instantly through space and time, I will now depart from our daring fur-traders. I will take the reader deeper into the heart of the vast wilderness and place them on the edge of a smaller body of water located in a south-westerly direction from the immense freshwater sea known as Athabasca.

This lake, while modest compared to the large bodies of water in the northern wilderness, is of considerable size, measuring about six miles across. It is dotted with numerous small islands, some mere rocky outcrops a few yards wide, while others are sizable, densely wooded islets. This lake is unique in that it sits in a hollow on elevated land, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding lowlands from various vantage points. To the west, distant blue hills can be seen, indicating higher terrain, while the land gently slopes towards them. However, from most directions, the land dips below the lake, providing a panoramic view of forests, plains, hills, and waterways that is unparalleled in any other known region.

This region exuded profound solitude, devoid of human presence, yet teeming with vibrant wildlife. The air resonated with the calls of wild birds joyfully soaring overhead, while ripples on the water's surface hinted at the lively underwater world. This was Lake Wichikagan, a place of serene beauty and abundant life.

Two Native American men, Maqua and Mozwa, sat smoking their pipes in contentment as the sun set over the horizon, turning the water golden. Their peaceful moment was interrupted by a distant Canadian canoe-song, a new sound in the Great Nor'-west. The men, Maqua and Mozwa, listened intently as the chorus of the song grew louder. As the boat carrying the singers came into view, Maqua and Mozwa were captivated by the powerful music. Just then, a chirp from the bushes caught their attention. Big Otter, a member of their tribe, responded to the chirp and disappeared into the bushes. He returned with two fellow tribe members, explaining that their camp was nearby for hunting and fishing. Lumley, a white man, welcomed them with a handshake, which they received with surprise until Big Otter explained the gesture.

While we were enjoying ourselves, a loud trumpet sound was heard nearby. Two stunning wild swans flew over us, but before anyone could react, our chief, Jack Lumley, shot them down with his fowling-piece. Lumley was known for his expert marksmanship and quick aim. The Indians, impressed by Lumley's skill, admired him. Donald Bane and James Dougall, our skilled hunters, had successfully brought fresh meat for the party.

Salamander, pleased with his prank, retreated into the bushes to plan his next move. Bane, recognizing Salamander's shrieking, followed the sound and found him. In the darkness, Bane silenced Salamander before he could reveal the prank. Salamander hoped to escape unnoticed, but Bane's firm grip prevented him from fleeing.|"['1.

Salamander, anticipating trouble, heard Dougall approaching and prepared to escape. However, Dougall's strong grip nearly choked him. In a quick move, Salamander pretended to faint, fooling his captor. Bane, feeling guilty, thought he had harmed Salamander. As they tried to move him, Salamander kicked and punched his way free, escaping into the bushes with a laugh. Meanwhile, Lumley and Mozwa reached the enemy camp, filled with armed warriors. Lumley proposed a trade, suggesting that sharing resources would benefit everyone and lead to peace. Lumley believed that if people helped each other instead of stealing, there would be plenty for everyone. The scene was tense, with the warriors ready for battle under the night sky, illuminated by a fire.|"[""1.

After arranging all things satisfactorily, we began preparing for winter. We gathered the whole party to choose the site for our settlement. Standing by the lake, our chief praised the spot's advantages. With a picturesque background, shelter from winds, and ample fish and water supply, it was perfect. The chief suggested converting a nearby rock into a pier for our boats. Tasks were assigned to set up our house and forge, prepare nets, and secure goods. Our chief instructed Max to guard the goods carefully and mentioned hiring Waboose to keep house. While everyone worked diligently, the chief sketched plans and prepared the ground for our future home. By evening, we caught whitefish for a meal, and the chief began clearing the land for our settlement.|['1.

I hurried with three companions to help. In a short while, the tall candlestick was placed in the hole and secured. Lumley had already prepared a small red bundle and tied it to a rope through the top hole. We were trained to follow Lumley's orders swiftly. We would run to him with our guns, forming a line for any situation. Lumley enjoyed drilling us this way, and we found it fun to compete to reach him first when called. Our guns were always ready, so we could act promptly. Lumley gathered us for a ceremony, claiming the land for the Hudson's Bay Company. We fired a volley, causing a stir among the Native Americans. That night, we celebrated with a feast, feeling safe and content. The next morning, we woke late, basking in the successful start of our settlement. Lumley tried to wake us at dawn, but we were too comfortable to rise. The Indigenous people watched us from afar, patiently waiting for us to stir. When we finally got up, the children observed us with curiosity. Lumley directed us on building the hall, discussing its orientation.|"['1.

Waboose looked at me calmly, even with a hint of a smile, after I thanked her for saving my life. As I reloaded my gun, I explained that sometimes one must resort to using fists when no other weapon is available. I emphasized that English people are skilled in using their fists, slightly irked by the amusement in Waboose's eyes. She seemed surprised by my consideration for her feelings, a novelty for her among Indian braves who don't often think about their women's emotions. In a melodic voice, Waboose shared memories of her father's kindness and love, contrasting it with her mother's affection.

Upon reaching Wichikagan, the excitement was palpable as the chief fisherman, Blondin, prepared to draw in a long seine-net. Natives gathered around, their curiosity turning to anticipation as the net slowly revealed its catch. The forest dwellers, initially mere spectators, now eagerly awaited the unveiling of the hidden treasures beneath the surface. As the net was drawn closer to shore, the sight of large fish leaping and splashing heightened the onlookers' amazement. The process of hauling in the net became a communal effort, with each native eagerly grasping a rope, their eyes widening with wonder and anticipation.

As the net closed in, excitement replaced wonder. The women and children eagerly pulled the drag-rope, enclosing a massive school of fish. Panic set in among the fish, darting in all directions. The tribe cheered each failed escape attempt. Canoes followed, herding the fish to shore. The men, almost naked, waded in to catch the fish. Women and children joined in the chaotic scene. The fish leaped ashore, matched by the wild leaps of the tribe. The net neared the shore, creating a frenzied spectacle. Some slipped into the water, mimicking the fish's leaps. The excitement was overwhelming. One brave man tried to roar but ended up joining the chaotic fish-catching frenzy. Canoes arrived to help, including Salamander and Donald Bane.

Tak a grup o' my hand, man. Here! wow! but it seems a fery frundly jack-fush that--whatever."" And, truly, it _was_ a grand haul; for, not only did we obtain enough of every species of fish that swarmed in Lake Wichikagan, to provide a right royal feast to ourselves and our red friends, but a good many were left over and above to form the commencement of a store for the future. By that time we had fairly commenced the fishery with a view to a winter supply. The weather was still delicious, and had begun to grow cool at nights, but as there was yet no frost, all the fish we took had to be hung up by the tail, and thus partially dried. Afterwards, when the frost fairly set in, this hanging process was dispensed with, for fish, once frozen in those regions, remain perfectly fresh during the entire winter, so that those eaten in spring are quite as good as those consumed in autumn.

I devised a movable barrier to lessen the impact of the water-spout, which worked effectively as we started the saw. The onlookers, including our indigenous friends, were intrigued by our progress. As the saw began cutting a large log, the sluice opened slowly, diverting most of the water-spout. Unfortunately, a lack of engineering knowledge led to the sluice breaking, causing chaos. The saw malfunctioned, and the water-spout wreaked havoc before dissipating. Despite this setback, a group of indigenous traders arrived with valuable furs, grateful for our new trading post.

The leader carefully examined the quills he received, pondering their value like a banker before making a trade. His sharp eyes scanned the room, and then settled on a corner where Lumley had placed furs. The chief's gaze drew the attention of others, and he began selecting items for trade. Starting with guns for protection and hunting, he then chose blankets for his family, followed by essentials like a kettle, tobacco, and tools. Lumley guided the chief's decisions, offering credit when the quills ran out. The trading continued with the rank and file of the band, including some troublesome characters.

At last, an event occurred that required a different approach. There was a tall, wiry Indian named Attick, also known as Reindeer for his remarkable speed. Despite his reputation for fleeing from enemies, his skillful fingers caught Lumley's attention when he attempted to steal tobacco. Lumley discreetly signaled Attick to stop, preventing the theft. However, Attick's desire for shiny beads led to another attempt at theft, this time caught in the act by Lumley. Swiftly, Lumley exposed Attick's theft of the beads, leading to a tense confrontation where Attick attempted to attack Lumley with a knife. Lumley swiftly and deftly removed Attick from the store, ensuring the safety of all. Despite this incident, trading continued, with Lumley lecturing the Indians on the dangers of gambling and the importance of honesty. During these discussions, an elderly chief inquired about the trading of alcohol by the settlers.|"[""1.

After a deep sigh, the work at the saw-mill continued in silence. I was grateful we didn't sell alcohol when I saw the strong Native Americans nearby. We had cut many planks for boats and houses before an incident halted our work. A leak in the dam was found, and we rushed to fix it. Lumley, sensing danger, mobilized us to reinforce the dam with heavy logs and stones. Despite heavy rain, our dam held firm. We returned soaked to a meal prepared by Salamander. Our foreman, Blondin, joined us for dinner, conversing in French. Lumley had crafted a board game from a bush's core, teaching me to play. Our chess battles became a friendly competition, with Lumley graciously acknowledging my victories.|"[""1.

Blondin sat by the fire, half-asleep with his pipe. The strong blasts didn't bother him much. We were all tired, the game lost its spark. Salamander sang in his room, and then chaos struck. Water burst in, sweeping us away. We were in darkness, then Salamander's yell broke the silence. A flood invaded our hall, turning it into a water tank. We struggled in the dark until a candle was lit. The scene was comical, except for Blondin, who stood tall. Salamander stumbled, and the door collapsed, releasing a rush of water. The men were carried outside, but the stream subsided, leaving us to assess the chaos. The dam had crumbled, causing the flood.

My father's final counsel to me was about the importance of honoring the Sabbath. He advised me to remember to keep the day holy, despite temptations to engage in regular work or amusements. He emphasized the blessings that come from respecting the Sabbath. When I questioned whether the Sabbath was solely a Jewish tradition, my father explained that it was a day of rest given to mankind at Creation and recognized by Jesus. We followed this belief while traveling, resting on Sundays and even noticing improved progress compared to others who did not rest. Lumley, a companion, conducted religious services and provided instruction during our travels. Our food supply was plentiful with fish, reindeer meat, and wild game. Lumley received a letter from a friend, revealing that his sister had joined him in the region, sparking excitement and speculation between us.|"[""1.

Lumley and I sat by the fire that night, admiring the snowy landscape. Lumley praised Macnab's sister, Jessie, for her courage in venturing into the wilderness. As winter set in, the snow transformed the surroundings, creating a beautiful scene. Lumley and I camped in the woods after a successful hunt, enjoying the warmth of the fire. Lumley teased me about plucking the bird for supper, but we were not too particular about it. The snow fell silently during the night, covering everything in a white blanket. The next morning, we woke up to a winter wonderland. Big Otter arrived at the fort with his family seeking help for his ailing wife. Lumley offered them work and a warm hut to live in. The woman, once beautiful and kind, was now in poor health, contrasting with her refined daughter.|['1.

One winter night, a severe frost arrived, freezing the entire lake. The ice was so smooth that it mirrored the trees and bushes on the distant islets. Max, an adept skater, decided to skate on the frozen lake, enjoying a pastime from his childhood. Lumley, unable to skate, worked on a track on the hillside while giving the men a day off. The track was a wide cutting up the hill's face, cleared of trees and shrubs. As Max skated alone, he realized the value of solitary enjoyment. Lumley's concern about Max's English lessons with an Indian girl led to a discussion about marriage and societal expectations. Despite Lumley's caution against influencing the girl's affections, Max vowed to approach any potential relationship with honesty and respect for her qualities.|"['1.

Oh! The exhilarating feeling of gliding over the vast sheet of ice on Lake Wichikagan was truly magnificent. The opposite shore seemed distant, making it appear as if I was skating out to sea. The strength and vigor of youth coursed through me, and I felt unstoppable. The smooth ice allowed me to glide effortlessly, reminiscent of a swallow skimming the water. The sun's brilliance reflected on the ice, dazzling me with its beauty. Despite a small mishap that left me seeing stars, I continued skating joyfully. After a while, a sense of loneliness crept in, but I pushed it aside and continued my skate.

On the next day, I attempted skating once more but quickly grew tired without friends to join me. Frustrated, I decided to give up. Nature seemed to agree, as the lake was covered in snow, making skating impossible. As I approached the fort, I saw black specks speeding down a hillside track. Lumley had cleared the slope for sledding. Remembering Lumley's words about balancing work and play, I eagerly joined the fun. I ditched my skates and hopped onto a toboggan, propelling us down the hill and colliding with others on the lake, much to everyone's joy. The scene transitions to a snowy forest on New Year's Day, where two men and sledges traverse the undulating terrain. One sled is pulled by an Indian, while the other, a cariole drawn by dogs, carries a fur-clad rider. They move silently, the sleigh-bells jingling as they glide across the snow-covered lake.|"[""1.

In the afternoon, as the travellers neared the end of the lake, the dogs mischievously overturned the white man from the sleigh. The dogs, resembling wolves, dashed away joyfully over the ice, causing their bells to ring merrily. The man, grumbling in an unfamiliar tongue, struggled to his feet. Lumley and I, waiting at Fort Wichikagan, heard the bells and rushed out. Lumley, recognizing the runaway sled, believed it carried Jessie, his sister. As the sled approached, the dogs swerved, spilling out a young girl with stunning black eyes. Lumley, speechless, was introduced to Miss Macnab, Jessie's brother's friend.

There was no applause when the music stopped, but everyone let out a deep sigh, signaling a return to normalcy. Waboose and her mother remained silent, in awe. Jessie Macnab blushed slightly but then started playing a lively Highland reel with great energy! Dougall let out a war cry and began a spirited Highland fling with Big Otter. Inspired by the music, I joined Macnab for a lively dance. Meanwhile, outside, Attick, a vindictive savage, plotted to harm Lumley. He lurked outside, planning to attack him. Lumley, seated by the fire with Jessie, noticed Attick's reflection in a mirror. When Attick tried to attack, Lumley swiftly disarmed him, saving the day.

During a time of peace and prosperity, our fort was filled with hope and joy. However, this tranquility was soon disrupted as dark clouds gathered, and a storm of consternation swept through our community. Following the unsettling events involving Attick's attempted murder on New Year's Day, the Indians left our fort. Attick, wounded not in body but in spirit, harbored deep resentment and sought revenge. With the help of like-minded individuals in his tribe, he plotted against us. As the Macnabs departed for the Mountain Fort with Waboose, I had a heartfelt conversation with her about a mysterious packet.

""A pine-tree or a grizzly bear, yes, I understand,"" Lumley interjected. ""He won't win her willingly; however, savages have a way of marrying women against their will. There's the risk of him trying to abduct her, among other dangers.""

One morning, I ventured out with my gun and Big Otter to hunt ptarmigan. Big Otter, though understanding English, preferred not to speak it. This didn't matter much as I could converse fluently in the native language. Big Otter silently agreed to the plan as he wasn't one for many words. We ventured into the woods, and soon spotted a covey of birds. Knowing the birds would flee if startled, we took turns shooting, successfully bagging them all. Big Otter shouldered the full bag and left. I then pursued a deer, losing track of time and distance. As darkness approached, I realized I forgot my fire-making supplies, leaving me stranded in the wilderness.

Feeling the urgency of the situation, I pushed forward with renewed determination, feeling my body warm up from the exertion. Hope surged within me along with renewed strength. Suddenly, I stumbled upon a set of snow-shoe tracks. Kneeling down to inspect them, I struggled to discern in the dim light. Yearning for a match, I realized the tracks matched the size of my own shoes, likely my own from the journey out. As the tracks led me to a clearer area, a sense of familiarity washed over me.

While Blondin spoke, memories of the previous day and the harrowing night flooded my mind. Grateful for my rescue, I sipped tea as suggested. Following his gaze, I saw our new dog-sleigh, crafted meticulously during winter. Adorned with embroidered harness, our team of semi-wolf dogs rested nearby, ready to pull the sleigh. Big Otter led the way, dogs followed with jingling bells, and Blondin held the tail-line. It was a vast, open land south of Fort Wichikagan, with prairies breaking the wilderness, creating a gentle, park-like scenery. The landscape was dotted with lakelets teeming with waterfowl, signaling early spring. Amid rolling prairies, buffalo herds grazed peacefully, unaware of approaching chaos. A cloud of dust heralded the arrival of men, disrupting the serene setting. The buffalo patriarch, sensing trouble, rumbled in warning, setting off a chain reaction among the herd.

The Native Americans, known as the redskins, chased a herd of buffaloes across the plains. Despite the buffalo's swift pace, the Indians on their wiry steeds closed in. As they neared a wooded area, the patriarch buffalo hesitated, sensing danger. Suddenly, the redskins appeared, surrounding the herd. Arrows and bullets flew, taking down the buffaloes one by one. Later that evening, Big Otter and Muskrat, two Native Americans, discussed a traitor named Attick. Muskrat vowed to punish him for his betrayal, while Big Otter recounted how Attick had threatened the settlers.

"The Native American was correct. Upon clearing the forested area, we noticed that the moon was shining, making it easier for us to follow the path. As we reached a small hill covered with dense bushes, our progress became challenging. ""We must catch up with them,"" the Indian stated firmly.

Although we didn't rush ahead as before to prevent the horses from tiring, Big Otter suddenly spurred his horse, racing ahead. We quickly closed in on the group ahead, who were now stopping to rest and cook. They pretended to be hunting buffalo, but we knew their true intentions.

When Attick raised his gun, I aimed mine, causing a distraction that allowed Salamander to disarm him. Big Otter's tomahawk swiftly ended the confrontation.

"Just before leaving, I reassured Eve, ""Your father is not dead, but sleepeth. You shall meet him again."" I explained how men use similar words when inspired by love for the Great Spirit. With urgency, I shared a surprise and showed her a miniature of her father. Overwhelmed, she wept, holding the miniature close. After calming down, I translated a letter from Weeum the Good.

We quickly took advantage of the situation. Some of our frightened horses broke loose, but others stayed calm, including mine and Salamander's. We rushed towards them, mounted quickly, and fled. Eve joined me, and her mother rode with Big Otter. As we galloped away, we heard our pursuers behind us. Big Otter fired at one of them, slowing them down. We pushed our horses to their limits, distancing most of our chasers. One persistent pursuer kept getting closer until Big Otter shot him down. We continued riding until we were out of sight of the others. We made camp on a natural fortress, a high mound with a clear view around us.

""I have some sweet water from the settlers. I always carry it when hunting, luckily had some today. Drink, it'll help."" It was the first time I called her mother, out of concern as she seemed unwell. Misunderstanding, she laughed softly, looking at Eve.

We were surrounded by foes and instinctively gathered in the center of our plateau, ready to fight back to back.

Exhausted, we found a thick part of the forest, dismounted, and made a bed of leaves for Eve. As we rested, Big Otter struggled to stay awake.

Dear reader, I will not recount every step of the long, diverse, and somewhat challenging journey that separated us from Colorado at that time. Our route was fascinating, as we traversed some of the most stunning and untamed landscapes of the North American wilderness. We deliberately stayed to the west, near the Rocky Mountains, to steer clear of populated areas. Due to space constraints, I can only briefly mention this lengthy journey. Upon reaching a village of a distant Indian tribe, where my guide was acquainted, it was decided that Big Otter and Waboose would remain while I ventured to the cities of the settlers to sell my diamonds. With a friend's help in Chicago, I sold the diamonds for a sum slightly higher than what William Liston had mentioned. I then concealed the bills within my breastplate, alongside my gold, and set off to reunite with my friends in the Far West.|"[""1.

Before that point was reached, much work needed completion. Daylight activities included tobogganing down the snow-slope and playing football on the ice. After dark, the Hall was lit up with extra candles, although the roaring wood fire made them almost unnecessary. A feast called supper commenced at six o'clock, accompanied by humorous and touching speeches. Lumley expressed regret for absent friends, particularly George Maxby.

The Indian prepared to camp by leaning his gun on a tree, setting up a fire, and laying out his bed. He needed to walk over fifty miles to reach Fort Wichikagan in time for a plum-pudding treat. To fuel his journey, he roasted venison, made tea, and carried bear's grease. He set off confidently on snowshoes, effortlessly overcoming obstacles. As the sun set, he continued under the rising moon, crossing prairies, woodlands, and frozen rivers. With determination, he pressed on through the night, only stopping briefly to eat.

Macnab said he foresaw the situation before it began and planned for it. He mentioned his upcoming furlough and his intention to accompany the boy to the States. They aimed to reach in time for a wedding, although it might be delayed. The boy, Lumley, had to walk in snowshoes due to the soft snow in the woods.

It is challenging to make a powerful man understand his vulnerability. Lumley, despite his strength, found himself in grave danger on the ice. He had to act cautiously to survive. Drawing on his gymnastics skills, he strategized. By sinking deep into the water before pushing off, he used the water's buoyancy to his advantage. However, each attempt to escape the ice failed, pushing him closer to death's door. Despite the bleak situation, Lumley fought fiercely for his life. As despair loomed, a brave Indian man, Big Otter, rushed to the rescue. Big Otter's quick thinking and use of snowshoes saved Lumley from the icy grip. Lumley was almost beyond help, but Big Otter's determination and reminder of the dark-haired pale-face waiting for him gave Lumley a renewed will to live.|"['1.
