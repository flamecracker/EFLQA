Cecile quietly slipped into bed, pretending to be asleep while her heart raced with anxiety. Aunt Lydia's watchful eyes kept her on edge, forcing her to fake slumber whenever she glanced her way. The only solace came when she was alone in the attic with Maurice and Cecile. Cecile hoped Aunt Lydia would leave for a moment, giving her a chance to retrieve her precious treasure. But Aunt Lydia, a smart woman, meticulously cataloged the attic's contents, determined not to leave until she had searched every corner. When Cecile begged for mercy, mentioning a purse, Aunt Lydia's demeanor changed, driven by greed. With Jane's help, they uncovered Cecile's purse, causing Aunt Lydia's joy and Cecile's despair.

Lydia believed the Russia-leather purse belonged to Mrs. Bell and had been lost in the attic. Cecile found it and decided to keep it, causing Lydia distress.

When the train started moving, Cecile carefully hid her purse in her frock, knowing her treasure was safe there.

Cecile, Maurice, and Toby quickly agreed to the ragged girl's offer of hot soup and bread.

The young girl, Susie, was found wandering in England, feeling desolate and longing for her mother. She refused to reveal much about herself, except that she was twelve years old. Despite her tough exterior, she would often cry at night, missing her mother. The kind couple who took her in, Mr. and Mrs. Moseley, welcomed her as their own. Susie's sudden disappearance after talking about France left everyone worried, just like another child named Cecile who also had a mysterious determination to go to France without revealing why. Mrs. Moseley sought advice from the clergyman, Mr. Danvers, as Cecile's behavior puzzled her. She feared losing Cecile like Susie, who vanished without a trace, leaving everyone in sorrow.|"['1.

The good clergyman did go the next afternoon, and finding Cecile all alone, he endeavored to get her to confide in him. To a certain extent he was successful, the little girl told him all she could remember of her French father and her English stepmother. All about her queer old world life with Maurice and their dog in the deserted court back of Bloomsbury. She also told him of Warren's Grove, and of how the French cousin no longer sent that fifty pounds a year which was to pay Lydia Purcell, how in consequence she and Maurice were to go to the Union, and how Toby was to be hung; she said that rather than submit to _that_, she and Maurice had resolved to run away.

The change in Toby's life was positive. His willful nature was being tamed by regular work and Mrs. Moseley's care. Without school or worries, Toby indulged in comfort, becoming lazy and uninteresting. Meanwhile, Cecile eagerly awaited a letter from France to travel with Maurice and Toby. She believed Lovedy was there, feeling a strong connection between Lovedy and Susie. Cecile envisioned reuniting Lovedy with her caretaker, Mammie Moseley.

A commotion and chaos followed. John Moseley grumbled about the inconvenient timing with Mr. Danvers away and extra responsibilities on his wife's shoulders. But there was no choice. The dying don't wait for convenience. Cecile helped Mrs. Moseley pack, tearfully bidding goodbye to her children. If her mother passed, she'd return only for the funeral, likely within a week. Cecile was entrusted to care for Moseley in her absence. Departing on the midday train to Norforkshire, she left with hope for a quick return. However, the next day shattered that hope. Mrs. Moseley, in a letter to her husband, revealed her mother's improved health, unable to leave her in such a neglected state. Cecile, walking home with Maurice, was startled by his sudden fear. Aunt Lydia appeared, her cold gaze fixed on the siblings, passing by without acknowledgment.

The group burst into laughter at the rough party. The peasant owner's face brightened. She rushed to the kitchen, returning with two steaming bowls of soup and a bone for Toby. The young girl's brave heart was troubled. How would they find Lovedy if they couldn't speak to anyone? How would they afford food and shelter in France? They felt lost and alone. Maurice, feeling hopeful after breakfast, suggested they simply take things as they come. He longed for heaven, where there was no cold or hunger.

Cecile then proposed a plan to escape Anton by using some money from her frock to travel south. She suggested taking a train to a place where Anton couldn't find them. Pericard returned late at night with food and warned them of Anton's anger. He urged them to escape that night as Anton would be more determined to find them the next day. The children were relieved and grateful for Pericard's help as they prepared to flee from Anton's grasp.|"['1.

Joe shared Cecile's plan with Pericard, who found it good but was surprised that three young children could afford a train journey. Since they couldn't trust Pericard further, Cecile gave Joe the money they needed. Pericard, knowledgeable about Paris, advised them to catch a midnight train to Orleans, suggesting they travel third-class to avoid being traced. They walked to the distant terminus, feeling a mix of emotions. Cecile, trusting her Guide, believed in their journey's success. Pericard helped them get on the train, and as it departed, Cecile kissed him. The children, with their dog Toby hidden, embarked on their journey into the unknown, leaving Pericard behind. They traveled south, reaching the sunny south of France, where Maurice thrived under the warm sun. Despite the monotonous forest landscapes, Cecile's hope reignited. Bordeaux had failed to provide any leads on Lovedy, but their determination remained strong as they continued their search on foot through the Landes forests.|"['1.

In the Landes, there were many small, peaceful villages where kind-hearted villagers lived. They welcomed the little pilgrims warmly, offering food and shelter. Cecile believed she might find Lovedy in one of these villages, similar to the ones her stepmother described. Joe, happy and free from fear, was now a French boy again, looking forward to reuniting with his family. Maurice enjoyed the sunny south and the kindness of the peasant women. Toby, the dog, learned to dance to support the group. In the Landes, the children were well cared for by the villagers who appreciated Joe's music and Toby's dancing. The children saved money and lived better than before. Eventually, they reached a charming village near Arcachon, where the people were less welcoming. Some inns even refused them lodging, prompting them to camp in the forest. The weather was pleasant, and they found a cozy hut with pine needles for bedding.|"['1.

In the forest near Moulleau, Cecile and Joe found a small farm that reminded Cecile of an English farmhouse. Despite feeling drawn to the farm, Cecile couldn't explain her emotions. Joe, wanting to earn money, collected fir cones to sell in Arcachon. While Joe was away, Cecile was fascinated by the farm and a golden-haired child she saw playing. Determined to leave for Joe's mountains the next day, Cecile struggled with her conflicting feelings. One night, as Cecile read to Joe from the Testament, they discussed love for family and Jesus. Joe expressed his longing for his mother, while Cecile shared her devotion to Jesus. Despite their conversation, Cecile felt torn between her desire to stay and Joe's need to find his mother.|"['1.

Maurice, a forest-loving boy, was wide awake and upset about the upcoming long walk. He preferred lounging under pine trees, watching turpentine drip into tin vessels, and observing the lively forest creatures. Determined to stay in his beloved woods, Maurice devised a plan. He would sneak away early in the morning to hide in the forest, ensuring Cecile and Joe wouldn't leave without him. Despite feeling drowsy, Maurice rose before dawn, eager to execute his idea. The forest's shadows intimidated him, but the cheerful bird's song and playful squirrels encouraged him to proceed. With bare feet on the cool grass, Maurice disappeared into the forest, hoping to extend his time in the place he cherished.|"['1.

The sun had risen, brightening the forest. Maurice realized he was lost, but found beautiful dog violets at his feet. Delighted, he decided to pick a bunch for Cecile. Unfortunately, a thorn pierced his foot, making it impossible to walk. As he waited, the forest came alive with sights and sounds, but Maurice, being young, wasn't scared. Anton stumbled upon him, mentioning a debt owed to Cecile and Joe. Maurice suggested paying it to help with their journey. Anton, contemplating silently, decided to return to the hut.

Little Maurice's directions were clear, and soon Anton saw the hut. He chose to stay back, hiding behind an oak tree. From there, he could see the hut's entrance without being noticed. Soon, Cecile and Joe emerged, followed by Toby. Cecile and Joe seemed worried and eventually split up, with Cecile and Toby heading to the village and Joe coming towards Anton. Anton was pleased with how things were unfolding. As Cecile and Toby disappeared, Anton approached Joe. Joe, lost in his thoughts about Maurice, was startled when he saw Anton. Anton was delighted to see fear in Joe's eyes. He taunted Joe, threatening to bring him to justice. Joe, distracted by Maurice's disappearance, urged Anton to help find the lost boy.

After becoming tired from his emotions, he fell asleep. He had planned to stay awake all night, but before the village clock struck one again, he was fast asleep. In his restless slumber, he had a frightening dream where his sick mother called for him, crying and on the verge of death. A voice urged him to hurry to her side, claiming she was dying of a broken heart mourning his absence. Startled, he woke to the village clock striking four, realizing the time had come.

Cecile felt a chill and almost fainted. She wanted to approach the fair-haired woman in the farmhouse to hear her story, but then Joe, looking pale and troubled, called her name.

Joe suffered in London, far from his mother and home, learning English from a dying friend. He endured hunger, cold, and misery, longing for his family.

Toby, the joyful and devoted dog, danced and barked with delight as he woke up little Maurice. The child, overjoyed, hugged Toby tightly. However, Toby needed a rest before continuing their journey. Both child and dog napped side by side, seemingly alone in the vast solitude. But in reality, guardian angels protected them. Even the smallest creatures are known to God. Maurice was safe, but Cecile, ill and delirious, did not recognize him. She was lost in her feverish state, mourning the loss of her trust and faith. Joe, feeling guilty for Cecile's condition, stayed by her side, seeking forgiveness in her unconscious state.

In his long suffering, Joe had almost forgotten little Maurice. But when he saw Maurice and Toby enter the hut, he felt relieved. Even though Joe didn't know much about sickness, he sensed that Cecile was very ill. He knew that sick people needed doctors to get better. So, Joe decided to run to the village to find a doctor for Cecile. He planned to find Anton too and return a piece of paper. Joe instructed Maurice to stay with Cecile and take care of her. Maurice was hungry and confused, wondering why Joe had to leave. Joe explained that he had to find a doctor to save Cecile's life. Despite Maurice's protests, Joe left to find help. He encountered an old woman who directed him to the doctor, who was attending a festivity. Joe, with broken French, convinced the doctor to come with him to the hut.

""I guess that's why you're so good to 'strays,'"" said John Moseley. ""Eh! but, Moll, what has come of your word, as you'd take no more notice of them, since those two little orphans ran away last winter?""

Any stray would do what it liked with Mammie Moseley. But oh! I do wonder what has come to my poor little orphans, them and Susie! I lie awake at night often and often and think it all over. How they all vanished from us seems past belief.""
