With the cargo shifted, water flooded the ship. The mate decided to launch the whale-boat despite the risks. Amid lightning strikes and crashing waves, they managed to cut through the rigging and launch the boat. The passenger and the seaman struggled to get the boat into the water, facing the wrath of the storm. The boat was finally afloat, but the ship split in two.

Harvey struggled over the stones in the ravine, feeling safe from the raging waters. Resting on a flat rock, he thought of his companions. Despite the danger, he retraced his steps to warn them. The rising tide compelled him to act. He found the spot where his shipmates had buried gold, but they were nowhere to be seen. Exhausted, he returned to the opening in the rock. Meanwhile, Wallbridge and the mate faced peril as the waves threatened to destroy the whale-boat. The men rowed against the wind, reaching the wreck of the Waldo. Seeking refuge, they tied the boat to the brig. The sea grew wild, and the cargo shifted, causing the wreck to sink suddenly.

The excitement of the catch was thrilling, with the two friends feeling the rush of adrenaline as they reeled in the fish. The real test now lay in the market price for the mackerel. Stumpy hoped for a good price, as it could make a significant difference for him financially. Leopold was also hopeful, especially considering the value of his family's property. As they docked at the wharf, the anticipation grew among the crowd, eager to see the day's catch. Bangs, from the fish market, was particularly interested, hoping for a bountiful supply. The outcome of the day's work would soon be revealed, with both Leopold and Stumpy anxiously awaiting the market price for their prized mackerel."|"['1.

Leopold had a stroke of luck that day with a hefty catch of mackerel. Bangs, the dealer, was surprised by the quality of the fish. They haggled over the price, with Leopold standing firm at ten cents each. Eventually, Bangs relented, and the fish were sold at twenty cents each due to their size and condition. Leopold earned forty-six dollars from the sale, with Stumpy, his partner, receiving a quarter of the proceeds. The two young fishermen were thrilled by their success. Later, Leopold was asked to help a sick man, Harvey Barth, find his missing diary. Despite searching the room, the diary could not be found. Harvey suspected a tipsy man who had visited him the night before.|['1.

Harvey Bath suspected that the tipsy man took his diary from the flue. He was certain none of the visitors could have taken it. Harvey believed the man thought it was valuable. Leopold found comfort in the invalid's room and then visited his uncle's watch-making store. Leopold's mother had German roots, and she came to the U.S. with her brother. She worked hard and eventually married Peter Bennington. Peter and Katharina moved to Rockhaven and opened the Cliff House. Peter aimed to expand the hotel to attract more guests.

His wife was faithful and devoted to him and the children. She had always done the cooking for the Cliff House, which had given it an excellent reputation. She was not only a good and true woman, but she was an exceedingly useful one to a hotel-keeper. For years she had tenderly thought of her absent brother in Germany. She often wrote to him, and learned that he was doing a good business in a small city. After years of persuasion, she induced him to join her in America. He was met on the wharf in New York, when he landed, by Mr. Bennington and his wife, and conducted to Rockhaven without delay. He could not speak a word of English then; but for six months he devoted himself to the study of it under the tuition of his sister and her children, till he was competent to carry on his business in the town. He was a very skillful workman, and all the watches in Rockhaven and on the island came to him to be cleaned and repaired. Even the rich men of the place found that he could be safely trusted with their valuable gold time-keepers, and he became quite celebrated in his line. He sold a watch occasionally, and had a small trade in clocks and other wares, so that he really made more money than in his native land. He had brought with him a considerable capital, and was enabled to stock his store without any aid from his sister. If Herr Schlager missed his|"['1.

Leopold, the proud new owner of a sloop, decided to let the boat's future name be chosen by its purchaser. The sloop, a speedy vessel with a spacious cuddy, was a prized possession. Leopold's uncle, equally delighted, embraced him in joy over the purchase. After finalizing the deal, Leopold rushed to inform his friend Stumpy and invited him for a sail. They set off to the boat, stopping by the hotel to inform Leopold's father, who approved of the purchase. Leopold then took two gentlemen to Isle-au-Haut for a fee. The trip was successful, with Leopold earning five dollars. The next day, the No-Name, as the boat was still unnamed, set out for a fishing trip, bringing in a bountiful catch of mackerel.

There was no work for Leopold at the hotel that day, but in the afternoon, he took his family and Herr Schlager out for a sail in the new boat. He was just as happy on this outing as if he had earned five dollars. The next morning, the No-Name boat had an unprofitable trip due to the absence of mackerel. When the boat returned, two gentlemen wanted to sail to Rockland, as there was no steamer available. While the skipper was negotiating with them, Harvey Barth entered the office looking sadder than usual. The gentlemen initially hesitated to have Harvey join them, but upon learning he was the lone survivor of the Waldo shipwreck, they changed their minds and invited him along. During the sail to Rockland, Harvey shared the story of the shipwreck and the loss of his diary.

In mid-October, a woman arrived at Rockhaven by steamer. She introduced herself as Miss Sarah Liverage, around forty years old. Despite claiming never to have been to Rockhaven, she displayed an uncanny knowledge of the Cliff House and its occupants. Miss Liverage, modestly dressed and lacking refinement in speech, seemed to harbor a secret purpose for her visit. She requested the room previously occupied by Harvey Barth, sparking curiosity among the hotel staff. Over the following days, her mysterious behavior intensified. She engaged in cryptic conversations with the hotel staff, hinting at important revelations but never following through.

When Leopold walked into the room, he found Miss Liverage pacing nervously. She shut the door and peeked out the window to ensure privacy. Miss Liverage seemed unusually agitated, hinting at an impending revelation. Leopold sensed something important was about to unfold. Miss Liverage assured him of her honesty and proposed a way for him to earn five hundred dollars. Leopold, cautious yet intrigued, vowed not to deceive anyone. Miss Liverage, now visibly anxious, disclosed her motive for being in Rockhaven. She hinted at a buried treasure involving Harvey Barth. Leopold, skeptical but intrigued, listened intently. Miss Liverage revealed details from Harvey's diary about buried gold on the beach. She suspected foul play in the disappearance of the diary.

Miss Liverage was certain the diary was still in the house. Leopold searched the hotel thoroughly during the storm but found no key to the hidden treasure of High Rock. The nurse also searched discreetly but had no luck. Miss Liverage reluctantly gave up hope of finding the diary. When the storm cleared, she looked out at the calm river. She decided to undertake the trip to find the treasure. Leopold took her out on a boat, but the rough sea frightened her. Leopold assured her of safety, but she was still scared. They returned to the hotel, and she vowed never to go on a boat again. Miss Liverage trusted Leopold and decided to let him search for the treasure.

The Cliff House landlord focused on his own business, not prying into the guest's affairs. Leopold felt uneasy hiding things from his father, especially about Miss Liverage. He doubted the nurse's tales of hidden treasures, recalling the tale of Wolfert Webber who dug his garden in vain. Though Leopold searched for the treasure as promised, he abandoned the hunt, feeling foolish. Despite the nurse's vague instructions, he dug around the cliff, finding nothing. Disheartened, he informed Miss Liverage of the failure. Leopold and Stumpy remained close friends, while Leopold excelled in fishing and odd jobs. The Hon.

In spring, Leopold, a young man, used his money to fix up a boat called the sloop. He was excited to sail the Hamilton family, especially their daughter Rosabel, who was very pretty at fourteen. Leopold named the boat after her. In summer, the Hamiltons returned, and Leopold sailed them around the bay. Mr. Hamilton hired the boat every day for a week, so Rosabel could enjoy the water. Leopold, a seventeen-year-old, often thought about Rosabel, despite their different backgrounds. In fall, Leopold's father borrowed money from Squire Moses to improve their hotel. During renovations, they found a hidden diary in the chimney. Leopold kept the diary safe, thinking about its secrets and his promise to Miss Liverage. He shared the story with his father, who dismissed it as a crazy nurse's tale.|"['1.

Eager to uncover the mystery, he felt the day dragged on until he could finally examine the diary. After finishing his tasks and dinner, Leopold hurried to his room and unwrapped the diary. As he read the entries, his excitement grew, especially when he discovered details about a hidden treasure and a man named Wallbridge who had buried twelve hundred dollars in gold. Leopold felt conflicted about sharing the treasure with the nurse, as per their agreement. Despite wanting to discuss the diary with his father, Leopold kept it to himself.

Leopold was puzzled by the writer's thoughts as he had not read the previous pages of the diary. The narrative continued with Wallbridge burying a bag in the sand and a strange coffin-shaped rock appearing during a lightning flash. Leopold felt uneasy about the sign and moved away.

He was intrigued by the coffin-shaped rock mentioned and planned to visit High Rock during a thunderstorm to see it for himself.

The innkeeper openly discussed his troubles with his wife and Leopold, causing the son to feel the strain as much as his father. Despite having enough guests to cover expenses at the old hotel, the new one was struggling. The landlord found it challenging to meet daily financial demands and was on the brink of despair. The interest on the mortgage was looming, and he didn't know where to find the money. Leopold, feeling the weight of his father's distress, thought of the hidden treasure at High Rock. However, he believed it wasn't rightfully his and hesitated to use it. Despite the temptation, he couldn't bring himself to take what wasn't his. Later, during a thunderstorm, Leopold was reminded of the buried treasure and set out in the Rosabel to search for it, hoping to alleviate his family's financial woes.|"[""1.

It was getting dark, but the lightning lit up the scene. The tide rose close to the cliffs. Leopold used an oar to leap to the shore. A squall hit, but the cliffs shielded the boat. After the storm, rain poured. Leopold walked the beach, noticing how lightning changed the rocks' appearance. He reached a ravine and kept walking, driven closer to the cliff by the rising tide. Calm, he thought about Harvey Barth's path. He reasoned that Barth must have walked towards a place called the 'Hole in the Wall.' Leopold believed the hidden treasure wasn't real. He decided to walk the way Barth did and spotted something that looked like what he sought when lightning struck the cliff.|"['1.

Leopold stood on the beach observing a rock that looked like a coffin when the lightning flashed. He realized why he hadn't seen it before; he had been too far out. Moving closer, the rock lost its coffin shape. Leopold marked the spot and reflected on the buried treasure beneath the rock. Remembering a boat-hook found a foot deep, he reasoned that hurricane sand deposits had hidden the treasure. Convinced, he retrieved a lantern and a shovel from his boat, Rosabel. Lighting the lantern, he dug under the rock, accounting for any discrepancies in the description. Leopold was determined to uncover the hidden treasure at Coffin Rock.|"['1.

After a dark shower, Leopold used his lantern to dig for hidden treasure on the beach. Working tirelessly after a long day, he dug a deep hole, hoping to find gold. As he dug deeper, he felt something obstructing his shovel. Excitedly, he uncovered a bag of gold exactly as described by Harvey Barth. Just then, his friend Stumpy appeared, surprising Leopold. Startled, Leopold quickly covered the treasure and pretended nothing had happened. When Stumpy mentioned Leopold's boat, they decided to swap boats to avoid damage. Leopold's secret treasure find remained hidden, known only to him and now Stumpy, as they made their way back to the Sea Cliff House.|"['1.

Leopold faced a dilemma when he realized that his friend Stumpy might reveal where he was found by his father. Leopold was honest and couldn't lie, but he also didn't want his father to use the hidden treasure for personal gain. He believed the money belonged to someone else. Leopold decided to confide in Stumpy and together they covered up the spot where Leopold had been digging.

As the boat sailed further into the bay, the wind picked up, making the sailing more exhilarating. Despite Mr. Redmond's nervousness, Leopold expertly handled the boat, knowing its limits. He skillfully navigated past a schooner and then turned towards High Rock, where the Rosabel sailed smoothly. Mr. Redmond, regaining his composure, tried to save face by claiming he wasn't worried but had been concerned for the safety of the girls. However, the girls were enjoying the adventure, unaware of Mr. Redmond's earlier fears.|"[""1.

The skipper landed his party at the Hole in the Wall, a deep ravine, while Rosabel led the way. Leopold, the boatman, stayed behind, not invited to join. As they gathered clams, Leopold couldn't shake thoughts of hidden treasure near Coffin Rock. Stumpy, with clams in hand, led them to the spot, despite Leopold's unease. Stumpy insisted on washing up at a nearby spring. The water was clear and cold, a luxury on a warm day. As Stumpy washed up, Leopold, feeling uneasy, waited on a bowlder. Stumpy, against Leopold's wishes, headed to Coffin Rock with the clams and shovel. Leopold, realizing his lack of skill in secrecy, decided to unearth the treasure and hide it elsewhere. Stumpy held the treasure, but an unexpected visitor, Mr. Charles Redmond, appeared, causing tension.|"[""1.

Leopold and Stumpy were engrossed in uncovering treasure when they noticed the arrival of a well-dressed young man named Charley Redmond. Charley explained that he had come down to the beach due to thirst and humorously recounted his encounter with the young ladies on the cliffs. He cleverly used a poetic quote to subtly convey his need for water. The ladies kindly directed him to a spring, where he quenched his thirst. Meanwhile, he overheard Leopold and Stumpy discussing the gold and decided to join them.

Leopold and Mr. Redmond debated the ownership of a buried treasure found on the beach. Leopold believed the money belonged to the heirs of the deceased owner, Mr. Wallbridge, and intended to keep it safe until they appeared. Mr. Redmond, wanting immediate access to the gold, proposed a deal to relinquish his claim for two hundred dollars. Despite the argument, Leopold hoped to convince Mr. Redmond to keep the treasure a secret. As they were joined by young ladies on the beach, the debate was cut short.

After Leopold safely docked the boat and dropped off the passengers, he hurried to his uncle's shop with a bag of gold coins. The watch-maker, Herr Schlager, was astonished to see the money. Leopold sealed the bag with red tape and wax, but he didn't believe the seal would protect it. Leopold trusted the safety of the treasure in his uncle's iron safe. Meanwhile, the story of the hidden treasure spread quickly around Rockhaven, reaching the Sea Cliff House where the landlord and others discussed it. Leopold, the finder of the treasure, believed it belonged to someone else and intended to find the rightful heirs. His father, the landlord, saw the gold as a solution to his financial troubles, but Leopold's sense of justice prevailed.

The dinner at Sea Cliff House was enjoyable for the guests after a morning of exercise. As they ate and discussed the hidden treasure of High Rock, rumors of a bag of gold spread through the village. Ethan Wormbury at Island House was dismayed by the news and rushed to his father, Squire Moses, who was equally troubled. They felt the money rightfully belonged to the heirs of the deceased man. Ethan planned to confront Stumpy about the gold. Meanwhile, Squire Moses worried about Bennington, who owed debts all over town.

Stumpy, dressed up, looked more refined than usual. Mr. Redmond teased him, but Stumpy cleverly responded, impressing everyone. Leopold was captivated by Rosabel, considering her the most beautiful girl. Stumpy's wit and attention to Miss Belle won her favor, causing Mr. Redmond to step aside.
