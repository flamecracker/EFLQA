In my introduction to _By Pike and Dyke_, I pledged to recount the final stages of the Dutch War of Independence in a future tale. The conflict was too extensive and intricate to fit into a single book. The previous volume concluded with the demise of the Prince of Orange and the fall of Antwerp. This sequel covers the phase when England, long a covert supporter of Holland, openly engaged in the war. England's involvement significantly contributed to Holland's triumph. Initially, the war was defensive, centered in Holland and Zeeland against overwhelming odds. With England's entry, the conflict expanded, securing Dutch independence through the defeat of the Armada, the capture of Cadiz, and the defeat of the Holy League by Henry of Navarre, aided by English forces and resources. The Reverend John Vickars of Hedingham prayed for Holland's deliverance on December 6, 1585. England's support for the Dutch cause dates back to their struggle against Spanish oppression.|"['1.

Breakfast at Hedingham Rectory was served earlier than usual on December 6, 1585. The village buzzed with excitement as young Mr. Francis Vere, cousin to the Earl of Oxford, prepared to ride to Colchester to join the Earl of Leicester as a volunteer. Accompanied by his brothers and friends, they rode to Colchester where a grand procession awaited the arrival of the earl and his companions. Cheered on by the townspeople, the earl and his entourage made a grand entrance. Mr. Francis Vere bid farewell to the young Vickars, promising to teach them the art of war when they were old enough. The following day, the Earl of Leicester and his followers sailed to Flushing to join another fleet. Over the next year, battles were fought in Holland, with both victories and setbacks for the English forces.|"['1.

Leicester struggled to train his small army using the Spanish system, the first English regular army, adopted to match the foe. Converting knights and countrymen to disciplined troops was challenging. Volunteers like Morgan and Rowland Williams, who had fought bravely for ten years, helped ease the process. Meanwhile, life at Hedingham was peaceful. The village, near the Colne and Stour waters, housed the grand castle of the Veres. The castle, a magnificent Norman structure, boasted intricate carvings and a strong keep. The Veres' vast property included villages and manors. The parish church stood at the village's end, where Mr. Vickars and his family, including sons Geoffrey and Lionel, attended prayers. The boys, raised amidst knights and festivities, dreamed of becoming soldiers under the Veres' banner.|"['1.

Mr. Vickars felt torn between his duty to accept invitations and his love for books. When the earl left for court, peace returned to the castle, allowing Mr. Vickars to enjoy the quiet at Kirby, where his son lived. The Vickars boys had ample free time, often spending it fishing, practicing archery, or exploring the countryside. Despite their mother's concerns, the boys often strayed from their studies to play. One day, after finishing their lessons and chores, the boys sought an adventure to London with Master Lirriper.

The skipper of the ship, the Susan, was preparing to set sail. He mentioned to the boys that they had to wait until the morning to depart as they were still waiting for the rest of the cargo to be loaded. The skipper was eager to make use of the fair wind, fearing it might change direction by the next day. The boys found the Susan to be a large vessel compared to what they were used to. The ship was decked and had a cabin where they would be staying. The skipper assigned the boys to the top bunks in the cabin, ensuring they wouldn't fall out in case of rough seas. He explained that their journey to London could take about three days depending on the wind conditions.

The boatman, John Lirriper, was in a dilemma. He pondered over whether to let the boys go on an adventure with Mr. Francis Vere to fight against oppressors. Although he feared the wrath of Mistress Vickars, who would not approve, he felt powerless to stop the boys if Mr. Vere decided to take them. John Lirriper knew that going against the wishes of the Earl of Oxford, the boys' father, could have serious consequences.

In a bustling town, soldiers were called to arms by trumpets, marching towards the river to board ships for battle. Geoffrey and Lionel, proud in their new armor, followed their company to the vessels. The fleet sailed down the stream for thirty hours until reaching Sluys, a town defended by the Zwin river. The castle stood at the eastern end, connected by a bridge of boats. The town's walls enclosed fields, gardens, and windmills. The English troops, led by Sir Roger Williams, were warmly welcomed by Protestant locals. Williams, known for bravery, inspired confidence in his men. The citizens housed the soldiers, and together they fortified the town against the approaching Spaniards.

The house was spotless, meticulously clean from top to bottom. Not a speck of dust marred the furniture. Even during the city's siege threat, the merchant's wife stayed vigilant over her maids, who were always cleaning. Geoffrey mentioned his mother's pride in their neat home, contrasting it with the Dutch households where cleaning seemed never-ending. Lionel thought the Dutch took cleanliness too far, prioritizing it over peace and quiet. Geoffrey joked about feeling like a criminal entering muddy after working near the sluices. The Duke of Parma faced challenges besieging Sluys due to the difficult terrain. John Menyn, a merchant, revealed the advantage of the Spaniards attacking the western gate.

The wine merchant explained that the cellars were not solely owned by wine dealers but rented out like houses. Different merchants may rent multiple cellars, connected by doors, based on their needs. Captain Vere was grateful for the information, ensuring the safety of men defending the walls. Despite occasional firing, the town remained calm. The garrison made sorties against the enemy but struggled against the Spanish pikemen. The townsfolk formed companies to guard the wall, with women creating a fort named Fort Venus. The women's strength impressed Lionel, while Captain Vere discussed the differences between Flemish and Walloon women. The presence of Protestant exiles in Holland from Spanish-controlled cities increased the population and strengthened the Dutch resistance. The Spanish cruelty and religious persecution fueled the Dutch rebellion. Vere's company was called to reinforce the castle garrison due to an impending attack.|"['1.

During the afternoon, the boys assisted in bringing down wounded soldiers. Gaps appeared in the walls, making the courtyard hazardous. The boys preferred hand-to-hand combat with the Spaniards over waiting in the castle. A council decided to abandon the castle under the cover of night due to the impending threat. Communication with the outside world was blocked. The garrison prepared to defend Sluys against a large Spanish force. Despite being outnumbered, the garrison aimed to hold out until reinforcements arrived. The English saw the town's strategic importance in preventing a Spanish invasion. The Spanish redirected their efforts towards the western gate. Captain Vere restricted the boys from the walls, keeping them safe. The boys observed the Spanish movements from a wine merchant's warehouse. The Spanish landed close to the castle, out of reach of the defenders' guns.|"['1.

Geoffrey and Lionel were discussing the suspicious activities they had noticed. Geoffrey was concerned that someone might be sending information to the enemy by tying a piece of paper around a bolt. Lionel was hesitant to accuse anyone based on just a soldier waving his arm. They decided to keep an eye on the soldier to see if he shoots again. They learned that the next warehouse was owned by William Arnig, a respected merchant. Despite being Catholic, he was open-minded and supported the cause. Geoffrey and Lionel planned to observe the soldier's actions the next day and report to Captain Vere if the shooting continued. They witnessed the soldier picking up bolts by the moat, raising his arm, and returning to the battery. They shared their findings with Captain Vere that evening.|"[""1.

Captain Vere and his men suspected a traitor communicating with the enemy. They devised a plan to catch the traitor in the act. The plan involved climbing onto the roof of a warehouse to observe and intercept any suspicious activity. The soldiers discussed the logistics of the operation, including using ropes and grapnels for safety. Captain Vere assigned roles to the soldiers, with Geoffrey tasked to climb onto the roof and Lionel to stand by the door for the arrest.

Early the next morning, Geoffrey went to his usual lookout spot with two chosen companions. Roger Browne, one of the men, volunteered to go up first due to his experience at sea. He skillfully climbed to the roof ridge using a rope and grapnel. Geoffrey followed, securing himself with a rope tied to Browne. Once at the top, they moved to a chimney stack to avoid being seen by the Spaniards. Geoffrey planned to strike a blow at the crossbowman below. Browne positioned himself above the window with a pistol for protection. The strategy was executed successfully with Geoffrey standing by the window edge, ready to strike, while Browne watched from above.

Geoffrey waited anxiously in the loft until he heard a footstep nearby. Gripping his cudgel tightly, he braced himself. After a brief silence, he realized the traitor inside was preparing a message for the enemy. Suddenly, a cross-bow appeared at the window with a bolt wrapped in a paper. With determination, Geoffrey struck the cross-bow, causing it to fall. Startled, the traitor dropped a pistol, accidentally firing it above the window. Geoffrey was then pulled up to safety by his companions. Together, they confronted the traitor, who was captured with a broken shoulder. The crowd gathered as they headed to Captain Vere's quarters. Geoffrey explained how they had uncovered the traitor's treacherous plans. The governor decided to convene a jury to examine the evidence found on the bolt, detailing the enemy's strategies.|"['1.

The governor made a grave decision, sentencing the guilty man to death for his betrayal. The two young boys were commended for their bravery in exposing the traitor. As the enemy forces attacked the town, a fierce battle ensued. The Spanish soldiers faced great challenges due to the flooded surroundings. Despite their relentless assaults, the defenders, including Sir Roger Williams, Thomas Baskerville, and Francis Vere, stood their ground courageously. The Duke of Parma himself witnessed the valor of the English and Dutch fighters. The defenders, greatly outnumbered, fought tirelessly, repelling each attack with determination. The battle raged on for days, with the Spanish troops constantly reinforced, while the defenders dwindled in number. Despite the odds, they held their ground at the breach, refusing to retreat.|"[""1.

During a fierce battle, the young pages brought food to the soldiers and bravely defended them. Geoffrey and Lionel stayed close to Captain Vere, ready to assist. Armed with pistols, they courageously fought off Spanish attackers, protecting their captain. When Captain Vere was struck down, the boys valiantly defended him until reinforcements arrived. Captain Vere praised their bravery and foresight, knowing they would become great soldiers. After days of fighting, the Spanish army resorted to mining, but the garrison was prepared. The pages, exempt from mining duty, kept watch in the cellars. During an enemy attack, Geoffrey's quick thinking averted disaster by bluffing the enemy with a torch near barrels, causing panic and thwarting their advance.

Captain Uvedale praised Lionel's brother Geoffrey for preventing the advancing Spaniards from entering the cellar, saving the city from invasion. Francis Vere acknowledged the young pages' bravery in detecting a traitor. The defenders fought fiercely in the cellars, amid gunpowder fumes and wine barrels, as the battle raged on. The besieged town awaited relief, with no serious efforts made. The garrison, exhausted and outnumbered, faced a grim fate until Arnold de Groenvelt surrendered. The Duke of Parma, impressed by the defenders' valor, granted them safe passage to Flushing. The garrison marched out with dignity, and the town was spared from destruction. The Duke entered Sluys triumphantly, marking the end of the siege and the beginning of preparations for the invasion of England. The Earl of Leicester resigned, facing challenges from both enemies and allies in the complex political landscape.|"['1.

"The captain yelled, ""Hoist the foresail!"" The crew rushed to raise the sail, but a fierce wind tore it apart. Bill quickly set up a new jib as the boat neared dangerous waters. The boat hit the sand with a deafening crash. Realizing the peril, the captain decided to save the boys. He cut loose the mizzen mast to make a makeshift raft. The boys clung to it as the boat broke apart. In a frantic struggle, they fought the waves, using their swimming skills to survive. The rough water dragged them towards the shore.

""I don't think I can go any further until I have rested, Geoffrey,"" Lionel replied faintly. ""Let us lie down in shelter if it is only for half an hour. After that, if the man brings us some food as he says, we can go on again.""

They stripped, wrung the water from their clothes, rolled themselves in the hay until they felt a glow of returning warmth, and then put on their clothes again. Scarcely had they done so when the man came in with a large tankard and two hunks of bread.

At any other time the boys would have refused hospitality so cheerlessly offered, but they were too weak to resist the temptation.

After a hearty meal of fried eggs and hot ale, the boys felt restored. Their clothes quickly dried in the oven, thanks to the landlady baking bread. Ready to go, they faced questions about the shipwreck. One person mentioned Ralph Hawker, known for being surly. The boys paid and left, but soon two horsemen asked for directions to Ralph Hawker's house. A gust blew off a rider's hat, revealing a shaven spot, hinting at a disguised Papist priest. Geoffrey suspected a plot and suggested investigating. They circled back to approach the house from a different angle, avoiding detection.

Geoffrey and his brother encountered a group of suspicious men while on Foulness Island. The men were well mounted and disguised, with one being a priest in secret. Concerned, they decided to investigate further. Upon overhearing a conversation in a house loft, they discovered the men's intentions were ominous. Geoffrey shared their findings with the earl, who immediately recognized the severity of the situation. The earl ordered horses to be saddled for a swift journey to London to report the matter to Lord Burleigh. The boys, accompanied by two servants, traveled to London and met with the statesman.

The English fleet set sail for Cape St. Vincent, hoping to encounter part of the Armada. Drake landed at Faro, stormed the fort, and took control of the harbor. Despite the massive Spanish fleet in Lisbon, Drake planned to attack. However, orders from England prevented him from entering the Tagus. He waited at the river mouth, destroying incoming ships and challenging Santa Cruz to battle. The Spanish admiral declined, leading Drake to sail to Corunna and destroy their ships. Meanwhile, Elizabeth negotiated for peace but refused to give up control of Dutch towns. The Armada's delay allowed England to prepare for defense. Parma's army in Dunkirk suffered due to cold and wet conditions. Philip's orders to start the Armada were delayed by Santa Cruz's death. The Duke of Medina-Sidonia's lack of knowledge further postponed the expedition. Elizabeth's negotiations for peace failed, leading to England's readiness for defense with 100,000 men prepared to confront the invaders.|"['1.

In May, the English navy, led by Lord Howard, set sail down the Channel. Sir John Hawkins, despite Elizabeth's frugality, had maintained the fleet well. However, the English fleet was dwarfed by the Spanish Armada. Philip of Spain had heavily invested in ship-building, while England's largest vessels barely exceeded four hundred tons. The English fleet was ill-equipped and under-provisioned. Crews were dismissed, leaving the country vulnerable. The Armada, with 129 vessels and 2430 cannons, was ready to sail. The fleet included galleons, galleasses, galleys, and armed merchant ships. The Armada carried provisions to sustain 40,000 men for six months.

On the ship were 8000 sailors, 19,000 soldiers, 1000 gentlemen volunteers, 600 priests, servants, and various officers, and 2000 galley slaves. They faced a formidable fleet off Plymouth with 29 queen's ships, 10 vessels under Lord Howard, and 43 privateers led by Drake. The English force was in dire straits due to Queen Elizabeth's refusal to fund them adequately despite ample treasury resources. Geoffrey and Lionel Vickars stayed in London with the earl but planned to join Francis Vere in Holland. Vere advised them to stay in England.

Upon receiving news of the approaching Spanish Armada, the gentlemen of the town swiftly boarded the ships. By nightfall, the queen's ships and privateers positioned themselves behind Ram Head to set sail at dawn. The Spanish Armada, consisting of forty sail, was spotted by lookouts on the western horizon. The English fleet, led by Howard and Drake, confidently engaged the Spaniards. The English ships, agile and precise, outmaneuvered the larger Spanish vessels. The battle raged on, with the Spanish struggling to close in on the English due to unfavorable wind conditions. As the day progressed, more English ships joined the fight, overwhelming the Spanish forces. Despite the Spanish vice-admiral's efforts, the English maintained their advantage.

The unfortunate events on the _Capitana_ were not the only troubles faced by the Spaniards. In Oquendo's absence, a dispute erupted among the officers due to the day's unfavorable outcome in battle. The captain struck the master-gunner, who retaliated by igniting a powder barrel and jumping overboard. The resulting explosion claimed the lives of 200 sailors and soldiers, but the ship remained afloat. The English salvaged the vessel and discovered untouched powder barrels. The next day, the Spanish fleet, with the advantage of position, challenged Howard's forces. The English maneuvered to sea, prompting the Spaniards to pursue. A fierce battle ensued, with the _San Marcos_ valiantly defending against the English onslaught.

On Friday morning, Howard set sail for Dover to gather much-needed supplies. The Earl of Sussex, in charge of the castle, provided what he could. The stores from captured ships were brought in light boats and shared among the fleet. Later that evening, the English fleet returned to its position behind the Armada. The next day, the weather changed, with strong winds and showers. The Spaniards, lacking local pilots, anchored near Calais. The English fleet closely monitored them, anchoring two miles behind. The Spanish admiral urgently requested gunboats from Parma, but they were unavailable. A council of war on Sunday decided to use fire-ships to drive the Armada out. The plan succeeded, causing panic among the Spaniards, who fled into the sea. The English pursued, engaging the scattered Spanish fleet near Gravelines. Drake and Seymour's forces relentlessly attacked, preventing the Spanish ships from regrouping. The English strategy paid off, as the Spanish ships were driven towards the coast, unable to return to Dunkirk due to unfavorable winds.|"['1.

Howard arrived with his troops at noon and continued the fire until sunset, almost depleting their ammunition. Despite not capturing any prizes, they witnessed three galleons sink and three more drift towards Ostend, where they were seized by English forces. The Spanish Armada was on the brink of defeat, with ships damaged and crews exhausted. The English, unaware of the full extent of their victory, prepared to pursue the retreating Spaniards. The Spanish, disheartened and battered, decided to sail north. The English fleet strategized to guard the Channel and chase the Spanish, believing the Armada would not give up easily.

Geoffrey, a young lad on a Spanish ship, found himself in a whirlwind of events during a battle at sea. As the chaos unfolded, he seemed to lose touch with reality, laughing and behaving strangely. Despite the officer's attempts to communicate with him, Geoffrey remained in his own world. Night fell, and he ate hurriedly, fearing his food would be taken away. When the sailors repaired the ship, he joined in, laughing at odd moments. Disguised as a ship's boy, he worked alongside the crew, hoping for a chance to escape. However, the wind favored the Spanish fleet, dashing his hopes. As the English ships pursued, Geoffrey's behavior grew more erratic, causing others to view him as harmless. The passage describes the challenges faced by both the English and Spanish fleets, highlighting the harsh conditions and strained provisions that marked this historical event.|"[""1.

A week later, the weather cleared, and on August 9th, Geoffrey saw fifteen ships at daybreak. Among them were the galleons of Calderon and Ricaldo, the _Rita, San Marcos_, and eleven other vessels. Signals flew from all, but the high sea made it hard to lower a boat. That night the storm raged, and in the morning, Geoffrey's ship and the others, except Calderon's, steered north. Ricaldo and De Leyva aimed for the Orkneys to refit. Calderon sailed south and met Sidonia with fifty ships. They navigated west of Ireland, most reaching Spain with crews weakened by sickness. De Leyva's ships faced bitter cold towards the Orkneys. The storm, sailors unaccustomed to cold, disease, and famine, forced De Leyva to head south. Some ships wrecked on islands, the rest hoped for shelter in Ireland. The Irish, co-religionists, and allies, turned against the Spanish. Wrecked crews were murdered by natives along the coast. Geoffrey, like others, suffered and worked tirelessly aboard the galleon. Surviving ships faced more disasters, with many crews perishing. Sir Richard Bingham of Connaught tried to rescue the survivors, but the fate of the Spanish Armada was grim.|"['1.

Sir Richard Bingham, known for his compassion, faced a daunting task with eleven hundred prisoners in Galway. Fearing their strength if restored, he ordered the execution of all but a few nobles. Among them was Don Lewis, spared and sent to Dublin. Unfortunately, many prisoners were too weak to walk and perished on the journey. De Leyva, a popular Armada officer, lost two hundred and fifty nobles in shipwrecks off the Irish coast. Geoffrey Vickars went missing during a collision with a Spanish galleon, presumed lost at sea. Lionel, grieving his brother's loss, received a call to join Francis Vere in Holland against Parma's advancing army.

"""No, indeed; you have been far more fortunate than I have,"" Francis Vere said. ""Except for the battle with the _San Matteo_, I have been inactive since we last met. No shots have been fired here, while you have been involved in the crucial fight for our country's survival.

Our forces have dwindled, soldiers unpaid and starving, with tattered clothes. Many have died, and others returned to England. The Dutch are more focused on quarreling than defense, eager for us to leave and return Flushing, Brill, and this town. I was relieved when Parma moved towards us after the Armada's defeat.

During a siege led by Parma, Sir Francis Vere faced challenges with mutinous troops at Gertruydenberg. Despite efforts to resolve the soldiers' discontent, they refused to return to duty due to unpaid wages. The situation escalated, leading to a siege by Prince Maurice, resulting in a failed assault. The mutineers ultimately surrendered the town to the enemy. This incident sparked accusations of treachery against English officers. Vere, appointed sergeant-major-general, navigated diplomatic complexities with various authorities. His appointment at a young age showcased his military and diplomatic skills. Vere successfully led forces to prevent Count Mansfeldt from crossing the Maas, with Prince Maurice overseeing the operation.

In October, Sir Francis Vere led troops to provide aid to the besieged town of Rheinberg. The States urged him to send another convoy as Count Mansfeldt approached with more troops. Vere took English and Dutch infantry and cavalry through a wooded area. The enemy ambushed them, but Vere's tactics forced the enemy back. In a fierce battle, Vere was briefly trapped under his fallen horse but was saved by his men. The English arquebusiers and pikemen defeated the enemy, allowing the convoy to reach Rheinberg. Geoffrey Vickars, a survivor of the Spanish Armada, hoped for a shipwreck to avoid capture.

Geoffrey returned to the ship as planned. Most crew members were below deck due to rain, looking forward to reaching port the next day. He shared his story with an Irishman, explaining how he ended up on the Spanish ship. Geoffrey, pretending to be Spanish, sought the Irishman's help to escape. The Irishman agreed, deciding to buy Geoffrey clothes to disguise him as a servant. They planned to meet in town after the Irishman landed. The next morning, as the ship entered port, Geoffrey was allowed to disembark with the sick. The Irishman arranged for Geoffrey to join him as a servant and escape to England.

As soon as he got off the boat, Geoffrey wandered off into the crowd of onlookers. A kind woman, noticing his pale face and unsteady walk, invited him into her home, where she gave him food and wine. Despite eating heartily, Geoffrey only smiled childishly and muttered his thanks in Spanish when she handed him a dollar as he left. He watched as sick survivors from the boat came ashore, keeping a close eye on Gerald Burke until he went into an inn with two men carrying his belongings. Geoffrey then lay down under some trees for the night. In the morning, he put on the clothes provided by Gerald Burke, washed up, and met him at the inn at six o'clock. They set off on their journey to Madrid on horses and mules, stopping frequently to rest and regain their strength.

As Gerald Burke engaged in conversation with the merchants, Geoffrey mingled with their servants, conversing to pass the time.

Gerald and Geoffrey sat at an inn with 500 crowns each, free from financial worries. Gerald's goal was to reunite with Inez and escape to England. Geoffrey vowed to assist.

In the morning, Gerald Burke and Geoffrey found a quiet spot on the ramparts to admire the sea view. Geoffrey marveled at the city's strategic location on a rocky tongue of land, overlooking a splendid bay. He pointed out the English and Dutch ships trading in the distance, closely monitored by war galleys. Gerald explained the bustling trade in Cadiz, a key port for Atlantic and Mediterranean commerce. He discussed the challenges of the city's limited space for expansion and its vulnerability to attack. The conversation shifted to a daring plan to rescue a young lady, involving a band of men and a priest for a potential marriage.

"Gerald Burke pondered quietly for a moment before expressing his thoughts. ""The plan seems feasible,"" he finally said, ""but involving a priest poses a challenge. In Seville and Cadiz, there are Irish colleges with priests I know, but persuading them to partake in such a risky venture is tricky. The main hurdle is recruiting the right individuals for the job. I can't simply approach anyone on the street and ask for their help in abducting a lady.""

Geoffrey suggested a muleteer they encountered earlier, connected to a group of robbers, as a potential contact to recruit individuals for the task. Gerald agreed, acknowledging the need for caution to prevent information leaks. Upon returning to the inn, Gerald sought out the muleteer to explore the possibility of hiring him and his associates discreetly.

The duo decided to continue their discussion away from prying ears on the ramparts, emphasizing the importance of secrecy to prevent any leaks that might jeopardize their plans.

The muleteer, impressed by the valour of the Irishman, discussed future adventures. The muleteer suggested joining forces due to the loss of his comrades in the fray. The Irishman, named Gerald, declined for now, wanting to organize properly. They agreed to meet at the inn in Jeres. Gerald gave a down payment, and they parted ways. Later, Gerald disguised himself and met the muleteer at the inn. The muleteer shared news of his friends, and they planned to meet again after his inquiry. Gerald advised not to reveal his disguise. The muleteer found his friends interested in joining under Gerald's leadership, and they headed to a shady inn. Gerald, disguised and armed, was followed by Geoffrey for backup.

Gerald and Geoffrey had a plan. They disguised themselves to approach Donna Inez. Gerald dressed as an old soldier with a sling and an eye patch, while Geoffrey posed as a sailor boy. The two friends walked to the Marquis of Ribaldo's estate, about twelve miles away. Upon reaching the village near the mansion, they listened to the locals in a wine-shop. Gerald, pretending to be a survivor of the Armada, mentioned that they fought in the Netherlands. The peasants suggested that Donna Inez was charitable and attended mass each morning, offering a chance for charity.

That evening, the companions rested on a bundle of straw in a shed behind the tavern, making final preparations. The next morning, they positioned themselves by the roadside near the village. The chapel bell chimed as two ladies, accompanied by a servant, approached. Disguised with a patch and false moustaches, Gerald took the lead in their plea for help, claiming to be worn-out soldiers from the ship _San Josef_ of the great Armada voyage. Donna Inez seemed startled but offered assistance, suspecting Gerald was in a fit. She handed Geoffrey a coin before continuing on her way. Pleased with the outcome, the friends changed back into their usual clothing and moved to a nearby village inn. Gerald shared his successful encounter with Donna Inez, revealing her love and their plan to elope during the upcoming festa in Seville.

The next day, they decided to try and get Inez away in Seville during the grand procession at the cathedral when the streets would be crowded. If successful, Inez could slip away unnoticed. They preferred this over forcibly taking her. They planned for the band to intercept the party on their way back as a last resort. Gerald went to the Irish College to seek help from a young priest, a childhood friend. The priest was away, so Gerald rode to the village where the priest was covering for an ill curé. The priest agreed to help despite the risks. They planned to bring Inez to the village to marry her secretly. Then, they would escape to Malaga and sail to Italy before heading to England.

Gerald intended to conduct a secret marriage ceremony in the church late at night. The duo would then stay in the village until the search for Inez calmed down.

Gerald and Inez, along with Geoffrey, left their peasant clothes behind and traveled to Malaga. They met rough-looking men but were not bothered due to their armed appearance. In Malaga, they found a ship to Italy and boarded it the next day. Gerald felt relieved that their journey was uneventful. Inez planned to write to her unforgiving father from Ireland.

After a brief stroll through town, they returned to the boat. The fisherman had sold out but was pleased to see them early. The guard scolded them for the delay. Captain Heraugière wanted to be dropped off discreetly on the left riverbank. He offered extra payment for the inconvenience. They avoided town, stayed at an inn in Leur, and met a peat-boat master. The man explained the fuel trade and the town's restrictions. Captain Heraugière shared his plan to capture Breda, seeking the boatman's help. Adrian Van de Berg agreed to the bold scheme. They discussed hiding soldiers in the boat under peat. The boatman pledged his loyalty to the cause. They planned the operation and decided to keep it secret until the right moment.

Captain Heraugière has proposed a secret mission to the prince, promising success. The plan involves eighty men, mainly from Dutch garrisons, led by Heraugière, Captains Logier and Fervet, and Lieutenant Held. They set sail on the 24th of February, landing near the Mark River mouth. Despite delays, they eventually board a barge loaded with turf. Heraugière stays on deck, updating the men below on the slow progress due to icy conditions. The mission's success hinges on Van de Berg's cooperation, although his strange behavior causes concern. The men hide in a barn, waiting for the next evening to proceed. Heraugière doubts Van de Berg's commitment, suspecting cowardice.

When the strong wind made it impossible to navigate, the barge was secured against the bank. For days, the storm raged, leaving the group stranded with hunger and thirst. Finally, on Thursday evening, they landed at Nordand, a remote fortified building. After resting and refueling, they set sail again when the wind changed. Progress was slow due to low water levels. As they approached the inner harbor, the barge hit an obstacle and began to leak. The boatmen worked hard to pump out the water. Italian soldiers arrived to tow the vessel to safety. A tense moment came when Lieutenant Held nearly coughed, risking exposure. The boatmen cleverly masked the noise, allowing the group to evade capture. Eventually, they executed a daring plan to overtake the fortress, facing grave danger but determined to succeed.|"[""1.

A group of seventy assailants, led by Captain Fervet, successfully seized the castle and defeated the garrison. Paolo Lanzavecchia attempted to negotiate but was thwarted by Hohenlohe's cavalry, who breached the palisade and took control of the castle. Prince Maurice and other officers arrived to find the fight already won, with forty garrison members slain and no casualties among the assailants. The burgomaster arranged the town's surrender, offering soldiers two months' pay to prevent looting and allowing residents to leave or stay without religious persecution. Holland's army, under Prince Maurice and Lewis William, had been reorganized into a disciplined force, utilizing new tactics and firearms.

The pirate ship was swiftly closing in on the vessel, and preparations were in full swing for the impending attack. Weapons were distributed among the crew and passengers, guns were readied, and cauldrons of boiling pitch were set up on deck. The young officer instructed the captain and sailors to man the guns and defend the ship while he and the passengers would hold off the pirates from boarding. As the corsair approached, the captain decided against using the sweeps to conserve energy for the defense. Despite the imminent danger, there was a sense of confidence among the crew. When the corsair fired its cannons, the ship retaliated with a devastating barrage, causing chaos among the pirates.

They had not expected to face more than the usual crew of a merchant ship. The soldiers fired their guns, then fought with pikes and swords, while sailors poured boiling pitch and water from behind. The battle was short. Many Moors fell to the cannons, and the rest, not many more than the Spaniards, soon lost heart. Geoffrey and some soldiers fought the Moors hand-to-hand. Amidst the chaos, they missed the call to retreat. As they were pushed back, Geoffrey saw the ships drifting apart, leaving them stranded. In the end, the Moors were overpowered, and the galley returned to port. Geoffrey awoke to the sound of oars, realizing he was saved but surrounded by death. The Moors tended to their wounded, while the Spaniards were thrown into prison.

Boldero was determined to save the father, even if it meant leaving the girl behind. Geoffrey and his friend used to visit the prison to help the galley-slaves, but they stopped to avoid suspicion. Geoffrey decided to rescue the captives alone. He followed the merchants and armed guards to a campsite. The captives were exhausted and mistreated. Geoffrey waited until nightfall and approached the captives. The father, with gray hair, refused to escape. He had lost hope after his wife's death and his daughter's captivity. Geoffrey respected his decision and left him there. The captives were in a hopeless situation, with nowhere to run. Geoffrey left them to their fate, knowing their escape would be futile.|"[""1.

Geoffrey and his companions had managed to escape from the galleys, a fate they did not wish upon anyone. With swords and pistols, they planned to carefully get the men into a boat and return them safely. Sailing towards the Spanish coast, they arranged for a fishing boat to take them to Carthagena. Juan Mendez, along with his daughter and the two Englishmen, arrived safely. To avoid attracting attention, Stephen Boldero took a Spanish name, and Geoffrey remained himself. They stayed at Mendez's house, where Boldero felt more at ease among the employees. Geoffrey, dressed as a businessman, and Boldero, as a ship captain, armed themselves for the journey to Cadiz, which they completed without incident.

The troops from different nations and backgrounds had varying motivations for fighting. The Huguenot gentlemen fought for their religion with stern enthusiasm, while mercenaries fought for pay.

Lionel watched the Protestant champion with admiration. The man was a unique blend of bravery and cunning, able to match opponents in both courage and strategy. Despite being the idol of the Huguenots, he faced great odds in France due to opposition from nobles and the Catholic powers. The upcoming battle was crucial for his future. The League, his enemy, was well-equipped and confident, adorned in gilded armor and banners. In contrast, Henry's Huguenot troops, battle-worn and solemn, prayed for strength. As the battle commenced, artillery played a minor role. The League's cavalry charged fiercely, causing initial setbacks for Henry's forces. However, the Huguenots held their ground, led by Henry with a distinctive white plume in his helmet, rallying his troops to stand firm against the fierce onslaught.|"['1.

After a fierce battle where the cavalry played the main role, Henry's forces emerged victorious. Despite a moment of panic when it was rumored that Henry had fallen, he reappeared unharmed, boosting morale with a renewed charge that routed the enemy. The Leaguers suffered heavy losses, and Henry had the opportunity to march on Paris. However, due to various reasons including financial constraints and political considerations, he opted for a siege. The city of Paris, under the leadership of the Duke of Nemours and with support from Spain, resisted fiercely despite dwindling supplies.

For a week, two armies, each with about 25,000 soldiers, camped close to each other. Parma's impressive cavalry, with banners waving, signaled an imminent battle. The king readied his troops but waited to see the enemy's strategy unfold. While the king was focused on the cavalry, Parma's main force secretly crossed a river and attacked Lagny. In Lagny, Lionel, a soldier, stayed back due to his wounded horse. He was asked to lead the English infantry stationed there. Lionel, who preferred infantry over cavalry, settled in comfortably with a citizen's family. He befriended the daughters, learning French from them. They discussed the religious conflicts and questioned why foreign soldiers were involved. Lionel advocated for religious tolerance and questioned the involvement of foreign kings in French affairs.|"[""1.

Lionel Vickars, a young officer, formed close bonds with a family while aiding Holland. He showed courage when he protected the household from unruly soldiers. As Parma's troops advanced, Lionel's infantry awaited a battle they couldn't join. Suddenly, news arrived that the Spaniards had crossed the river to besiege the town. The townspeople prepared for defense, fearing the brutal reputation of the Spanish army. Despite the chaos, Lionel's calm leadership inspired hope. The townspeople readied themselves, determined to resist the siege. Lionel's company stood ready, organized and disciplined, awaiting their orders on the walls. The tense atmosphere contrasted sharply with the calm resolve Lionel had seen in the Dutch towns.|"['1.

During a battle, the Spanish forces attacked the town where Lionel and his companions were defending a gate. Despite their bravery, the Spaniards managed to breach the walls and enter the town from multiple points. Realizing the futility of further resistance, the defenders were advised to seek refuge in churches. Lionel, along with his host, found a hidden passage leading to a secret underground chamber beneath the merchant's house. In this safe haven, they were joined by the merchant's family and could stay hidden with enough provisions for a couple of months, away from the chaos and danger above ground.|"['1.

The merchant's servant, badly wounded by the Spaniards, returned to report the brutal attack. The merchant and his family, fearing for their safety, discussed a plan for the servant, Lionel, to escape the town and rejoin the Huguenot army. Lionel disguised himself in the servant's clothes and, with Jacques' help, slipped out through the open gates of the town. Jacques guided Lionel towards the Huguenot army, ensuring his safe passage. Lionel expressed gratitude to the merchant and his family for their aid before embarking on his journey. The townsfolk, preoccupied with daily tasks, did not question Lionel's departure.|"[""1.

Jacques, after gathering information about Parma's army, guided Lionel to Henry's camp. They took precautions and avoided detection by Parma's cavalry. Peasants they encountered were curious about news from Paris, and Jacques reassured them with a fabricated story. Upon reaching the camp, Lionel was warmly welcomed by Sir Ralph Pimpernel. Henry, learning about the capture of Lagny, realized he had been outmaneuvered by Parma. The situation worsened as Parma's army caused havoc in France. However, Parma's troops faced sickness and internal conflicts, prompting his departure. Henry seized the opportunity, recaptured Lagny and Corbeil, and resumed the siege of Paris. Parma's absence allowed Henry to regain lost ground. Lionel, after reuniting with Jacques and the mercer's family, protected them from further turmoil in Lagny. Prince Maurice's brief visit concluded as Parma returned to the Netherlands, ending the stalemate.|"[""1.

During their absence, little activity occurred in the Netherlands, except for Sir Francis Vere's successful storming of Spanish fortifications near Recklinghausen. He relieved the town and drove off the besiegers. Subsequently, he captured a fort on the Rhine opposite Wesel. By the end of 1590, around eight thousand English troops were stationed in Holland, heralding a shift in the war's dynamics. Prince Maurice, with his improved army and English allies, initiated an offensive strategy. In May, he coordinated with Vere to besiege Zutphen. However, Vere first recaptured Zutphen's forts across the river, using a clever ruse involving disguised soldiers. The allies swiftly conquered Zutphen and advanced towards Deventer, overcoming challenges and ultimately securing victories against the Spaniards.|"['Question 1:\nWhat successful military action did Sir Francis Vere carry out near Recklinghausen?\nA) Negotiating a peace treaty with the besiegers\nB) Capturing a fort on the Rhine\nC) Relieving the town and driving off the besiegers\nD) Initiating a defensive strategy\nE) Forming an alliance with the Spaniards', ""Question 2:\nWhat heralded a shift in the dynamics of the war in Holland by the end of 1590?\nA) A decrease in the number of English troops in Holland\nB) The surrender of Zutphen to the Spaniards\nC) Prince Maurice's resignation from his position\nD) The capture of a fort on the Rhine\nE) Eight thousand English troops stationed in Holland"", ""Question 3:\nHow did Sir Francis Vere capture Zutphen's forts across the river?\nA) By launching a direct frontal assault\nB) Through a clever ruse involving disguised soldiers\nC) By negotiating a surrender with the Spaniards\nD) By seeking reinforcements from the Dutch army\nE) By retreating and regrouping with Prince Maurice's forces"", 'Question 4:\nWhat offensive strategy did Prince Maurice initiate in May?\nA) A strategy of retreat and defense\nB) Coordinating with Vere to besiege Zutphen\nC) Negotiating a ceasefire with the Spaniards\nD) Withdrawing English troops from Holland\nE) Forming an alliance with the French army', 'Question 5:\nWhat challenges did the allies face while advancing towards Deventer?\nA) Lack of supplies and ammunition\nB) Unfavorable weather conditions\nC) Strong resistance from the Spanish forces\nD) Internal conflicts among the English troops\nE) Betrayal by their Dutch allies', 'Question 6:\nWhat did the allies ultimately achieve after securing victories against the Spaniards?\nA) Forming a peace treaty with the Spanish forces\nB) Establishing a new stronghold in Zutphen\nC) Retreating to England for reinforcements\nD) Advancing towards Amsterdam\nE) Securing victories and overcoming challenges']"|['C) Relieving the town and driving off the besiegers', 'E) Eight thousand English troops stationed in Holland', 'B) Through a clever ruse involving disguised soldiers', 'B) Coordinating with Vere to besiege Zutphen', 'C) Strong resistance from the Spanish forces', 'E)']
The Duke of Parma believed he had enough time to capture Knodsenburg before Prince Maurice could return to help. The prince faced obstacles with two rivers and treacherous terrain on his way back. However, Prince Maurice swiftly mobilized his army, crossing the rivers and marshes within days to confront the Spanish forces. With strategic planning, Vere, a trusted commander, led a successful ambush against the Spaniards, capturing many prisoners and horses. This victory forced Parma to retreat, boosting the morale of the Netherlanders while demoralizing the Spanish. Parma, ill and disappointed, had lost ground due to futile expeditions in France. Meanwhile, Maurice continued his successful campaigns, capturing key cities like Nymegen. These victories consolidated the Dutch territories, weakening Spanish dominance. Maurice's innovative tactics, including using spades in sieges, proved effective in overcoming strong fortresses like Steenwyk.|"['1.

The attacking parties swiftly advanced, capturing the two strongholds and leaving the town vulnerable. The following day, the defending forces surrendered and were allowed to retreat. Casualties were high on both sides, with 350 defenders and about 600 attackers losing their lives. After securing Steenwyk, Prince Maurice turned his attention to the heavily fortified Coevorden. The city, situated between swamps with a narrow passage, was well defended by Count Frederick Van der Berg. Despite Verdugo's attempts to seek reinforcements, none arrived, allowing the prince to focus on fortifying his position. Meanwhile, Sir Francis Vere reluctantly obeyed orders to join forces aiding Henry of Navarre in Brittany. However, upon hearing of an imminent attack on Prince Maurice's camp, Vere rushed to provide support, ultimately turning the tide of the battle and leading to the surrender of Coevorden.|"['1.

During a long siege, the town endured relentless bombardment from artillery and Zeeland ships. Eventually, after ninety days, the town fell when three Dutch captains scaled the fort's wall. A fierce hand-to-hand struggle ensued, resulting in casualties on both sides. The Governor Gysant was killed in the chaos. The city surrendered, and the garrison was allowed to leave with their belongings. Subsequently, Coevorden was relieved, and Groningen was besieged and forced to surrender after sixty-five days. This marked the liberation of Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland from Spanish control. Sir Francis Vere and his English troops played a crucial role in supporting the Dutch during the conflict. The Spanish army, led by Mondragon, dealt a blow to the allies at Crolle, forcing them to lift the siege.|"[""1.

In 1590, Horace Vere joined the army, following his brother Robert's death in battle. Survivors, led by Sir Nicholas Parker and Marcellus Bacx, retreated under Prince Maurice's protection. Sir Francis Vere returned to Holland in 1596 to prepare for a joint English-Dutch expedition against Spain. The fleet, including 22 Dutch ships and English troops, sailed from Dover to Plymouth, manned by over 7,000 sailors. Sir Francis Vere and Sir Walter Raleigh led the ground and sea forces, respectively. They set sail on June 1st, heading towards Cadiz, Spain. The English fleet aimed to attack the Spanish ships and capture their cargo. The expedition faced resistance from Spanish forts and war vessels defending Cadiz.

At dawn the next day, the ships raised their anchors and sailed up the channel, eager to engage with the enemy. A fierce battle ensued with the fort, men-of-war, and galleys bombarding the English ships. Despite heavy fire, the English ships retaliated fiercely. The galleys sought refuge near the fort while the battle raged on from morning till late afternoon. The Spaniards eventually retreated, some ships captured while others escaped. Meanwhile, Sir Francis Vere led a successful land operation with regiments landing between Puntales fort and the town. The English forces surprised the Spanish, capturing the walls of Cadiz.

In the past, Geoffrey was involved in various adventures in Holland and France, including the capture of Breda and fighting alongside Henry of Navarre. Despite being Protestant, he managed to avoid detection by the Inquisition by attending Catholic services with his wife and father-in-law. Geoffrey, having been a slave among the Moors, now sees religious distinctions differently. He plans to eventually discuss his Protestant beliefs with his Spanish wife once they settle in England. Sir Francis Vere, a skilled general, is frustrated by the missed opportunity to capture Spanish merchant ships at Cadiz.

Geoffrey had to stay behind as his fleet was at sea, and leaving would result in their confiscation upon return. He planned to gradually wind down his business in Spain, sending goods suitable for the English market on Geoffrey's ships. This move would not arouse suspicion, as it would appear Geoffrey insisted on taking his share. Geoffrey sailed for England with his family on Sir Francis Vere's ship, the _Rainbow_. The fleet's departure from Cadiz led to the town being set ablaze, causing significant destruction. In London, Geoffrey and Dolores were warmly welcomed. Geoffrey decided to settle in London, partnering with his father-in-law in trade.

Geoffrey, after serving an apprenticeship in trade in Cadiz, gained the confidence to establish his business. He informed the firm's correspondents in various European ports that the headquarters would now be in London, trading with all ports except those in Spain. Mendez and Vickars quickly became one of the leading trading houses in London, after Geoffrey's marriage to Dolores. Following the capture of Cadiz, Lionel Vickars joined an expedition under Sir Francis Vere to attack the Spanish fleet in Ferrol. The mission faced severe weather and had to retreat to England. Despite the setbacks, the storm scattered and destroyed the Spanish fleet, saving England from invasion. Sir Francis Vere later advised Prince Maurice in an attack on Spanish forces near Turnhout, leading to a successful engagement.|"[""1.

Several companies of horse galloped after the enemy's horse and baggage. Vere saw they needed help and formed up the English cavalry to cover their retreat. The disordered horse returned, pursued by the Spanish cavalry. But seeing Vere's troops ready, the Spanish retreated. Count Varras was slain, and 300 Spanish infantry killed. 600 prisoners were taken, and 38 colors captured. The victory was achieved by 800 allied horse. The infantry never made it to the field. The success was a cause for celebration. Archduke Albert succeeded Archduke Ernest in governing the Netherlands. His troops had lost confidence, while Holland had grown prosperous. Spain's resources were drained, leading Philip to seek peace with France and England. Henry IV accepted the terms, making a separate peace. A new treaty was made between England and the Netherlands. Sir Francis Vere negotiated the treaty. The States agreed to relieve England of some war expenses. Lord Burleigh of England and Philip of Spain passed away. The Netherlands were ceded to Isabella, and Philip III married Margaret of Austria. In 1599, there was fierce fighting on the island between the Waal and Maas rivers. The States-general planned an offensive campaign for the following year, which was opposed by Prince Maurice and Sir Francis Vere.

The Dutch army swiftly moved towards Ostend, capturing the fort and redoubts to clear the way for offensive operations. Two thousand soldiers were stationed to guard these key positions. The rest of the army navigated the challenging terrain to reach Nieuport for a siege. The Dutch fleet supported by constructing a bridge across a river. News arrived that the enemy was approaching the captured forts near Ostend. Despite differing opinions, Sir Francis Vere believed the main Spanish force was advancing. Prince Maurice dispatched troops to halt the enemy's progress. The Dutch army positioned themselves strategically among sand-hills, preparing for battle. Vere advised waiting for the enemy's approach, a decision that was followed. The Spanish army, led by Marshal Zapena, advanced with infantry and cavalry.

On the 2nd of June, 1600, at half-past two in the afternoon, the battle commenced. Sir Francis Vere devised a strategic plan to tire out the Spaniards by holding his position, calling for reserves, and then launching a full attack. Lionel Vickars' company was stationed on the East Hill along with other troops. A fierce fight ensued when five hundred Spanish infantry charged the hill. Despite intense fighting, the Spaniards were forced to retreat. The Spanish cavalry also faced heavy fire, causing them to fall back. Vere then ordered English troops to flank the Spaniards, leading to their retreat. Despite being outnumbered, the English held their ground until reinforcements arrived.

An English buccaneer once chased a petty trader short of water and vegetables, only to find a surprising turn of events. The buccaneer was astonished when the trader revealed his adventurous past, including being a galley-slave and a prisoner among various groups. Initially skeptical, the buccaneer later acknowledged the trader's bravery after a successful capture of a Spanish galleon loaded with silver. The trader earned a substantial share of the prize money and decided to settle down in Devonshire. Despite plans to work together, the trader eventually pursued a different path, settling down on a small estate due to family ties.

On the night of December 4th, they launched a sudden assault, but Sir Horace Vere and his officers bravely defended the town, driving the besiegers back. However, with dwindling resources and a small garrison, Vere faced a tough decision. In a council with his officers, opinions were divided on whether to abandon the outlying forts to protect the town. Vere took a bold step by sending a message to the archduke through Spanish envoys, buying crucial time.

The English soldiers, led by Vere and Fairfax, strategically positioned themselves to repel the invaders. With barrels of ashes, stones, and hand-grenades, they thwarted multiple attempts to breach their defenses. Vere's vigilance paid off as the enemy's assault was ultimately repulsed.
