A line of wagons and soldiers moved slowly through the dark and rainy hills toward the South. The wagons carried around fourteen or fifteen thousand wounded soldiers who endured the bumpy ride in silence. Despite their youth, these soldiers showed remarkable self-control, only occasionally letting out a groan. The main sounds were the wheels turning and the horses' hooves in the soft earth. The officers gave few commands, and the cavalrymen riding alongside checked on their wounded companions without speaking much. The soldiers, used to the darkness and rain after a fierce battle at Gettysburg, remained confident in their commander, Lee, even though they missed General Jackson. Harry Kenton, observing the rear of the column, saw no signs of pursuit by the Union Army. The soldiers, battered but resolute, were ready to fight again if needed.|"['1.

The two friends left the wagon and walked along a muddy path beside the road, marked by deep ruts from hoofs and wheels.

A significant group of the opposing forces attempted to cross the creek behind us. Captain Sherburne's troop, together with three infantry companies, engaged them and successfully repelled the attack after a fierce encounter. Harry, after handing his horse to an orderly, resumed his position under a tree, away from the generals' discussions but within sight.

Harry hoped that the three would meet in friendship around a festive table, moved by the affection the two colonels held for Carrington. Doubtless, the great artilleryman felt the same. They camped in a rolling country of hills, valleys, forests, and clear streams. Harry liked the Northern land close to the South, neat and trim. He saw the evidence of free labor, where man's success or failure was his own. He pondered on the curse of slavery in the South, believing it was the South's duty to abolish it. As the night fell, Lee and his generals gathered near a small spring in a cove. An atmosphere of suspense surrounded them, with the Potomac rising and Northern cavalry blocking their way. Harry, not yet sleepy, watched the anxious council until sleep overtook him. He was awakened before dawn to join a detachment to clear a path, led by Colonel Sherburne.|"[""1.

Harry was happy to depart. Although he had moments of deep contemplation and a serious demeanor, he was fundamentally inclined towards action, much like his esteemed ancestor. His blood raced faster with the rhythm of his horse's hooves, and his mood lifted as the fresh air of the fields and forests whizzed by. He was also very eager to uncover what lay ahead. If obstacles existed, he desired to face them. If the Union cavalry obstructed their efforts to lay bridges across the Potomac, he was determined to assist in driving them off.

Late into the night, the rain stopped, leaving the earth soaked and trees dripping with water at Sherburne's camp. Despite the risk of spies, a large fire was lit for comfort and courage. Vigilant riflemen guarded, while the young officers dried their clothes by the fire, laughing freely. Harry admired Dalton's spirit and St. Clair's neatness.

Shepard, despite his feelings towards his enemies, was determined to act against them with skill and bravery. He understood Sherburne's mission to open a path for the Army of Northern Virginia to the Potomac and find a way to cross it. Shepard aimed to thwart this plan. The rain had filled Shepard with joy as he saw the swollen waters that would hinder Sherburne's efforts. He decided to shadow Sherburne's movements, observe their strategy, and then swiftly bring Union brigades to counter them. Despite feeling watched, Sherburne did not suspect Shepard's presence. After gathering the necessary information, Shepard withdrew without detection.

Harry knew the rain would soon stop, and if the waves calmed down, he would sail his boat on the river again. However, he lost a precious hour. The thunder stopped, leaving only faint lightning. The waves lessened, so Harry set off in his boat again. Despite the rocking and water intake, he kept it afloat. As the wind decreased, he decided to head to the northern shore. But the steep banks prevented him from landing. He heard oars, saw another boat with a single person, and was ordered to stop. Ignoring the command, he rowed faster. The pursuer shot at him twice, narrowly missing. Harry fired back but missed. Seeing the pursuer closing in, he aimed his boat at him, causing a collision that sank both boats.|"['1.

Harry rushed into the forest, running for half an hour to create distance between him and Shepard before Shepard regained his full strength.

The path Harry followed pointed towards Lee's army, yet the distance could be a problem. He sensed Federal troops nearby as a farmer and his wife signaled from their rooftop. Despite the couple's bravery, Harry suspected they alerted pursuers after sharing breakfast. With the road flanked by hills, he scanned for enemy flags but saw none due to dense forest.

Harry pondered quickly as the two flags mocked him. The fields were deep with mud from the rains, but he had to attempt crossing. Luckily, the flags were out of rifle range. Choosing the western side, he dismounted, removed a few rails, and swiftly leaped over the fence on his horse. The plowed field made progress slow, but he knew his pursuers faced the same challenge. As shouts revealed his trick, some cavalrymen took aim, missing by a wide margin. Harry laughed defiantly, shaking his fist at them. The cavalry split, some pursuing directly while others circled around the field. Harry urged his tired horse on, nearing the woods. Aware of the threat, he hurried, praising his loyal companion. Reaching the fence, he quickly removed it, galloping into the bushes for cover. With the Union cavalry on his trail, he sought a brief respite, stopping in thick undergrowth to rest both himself and his horse.

He stood still, hand on the horse's nose to keep him quiet, hearing the search sounds. Hoofs and voices approached. He led the horse through dense forest, trying to lose the pursuers.

He enjoyed the peaceful break, finding relaxation in his mind rather than just in his body. After being on edge, he finally unwound completely, lying flat with his shotgun still in his grasp. Resting on a soft couch, he listened to a bird's song overhead, hidden among the leaves. Curious about the bird's size and volume of its song, he mused on the idea of sound in proportion to one's size. As he drifted off, a voice urged him awake, warning of danger nearby.

Harry, a skilled woodsman and descendant of Henry Ware, possessed an innate sense of direction and survival. Dismissing the Central European youths' lack of woodcraft, he relied on the sun for guidance. Resting by a stream, Harry found provisions in Michael's bag, grateful for the sustenance.

"He stayed hidden among the trees, enjoying the peaceful night under the starry sky. Unable to spot any soldiers despite searching with his glasses, he knew they lurked in the hollows and forests. A gentle breeze rustled through the air, accompanied by the lonely hoot of an owl. Keeping his horse on course towards the narrow valley where the ""rebel raiders"" roamed, he encountered Connecticut men who let him pass upon seeing his canteen and letter. Continuing southwest, he later turned west, encountering two alert Union soldiers who scrutinized him closely. When one of them drew a pistol, he swiftly evaded the bullet, engaging in a fierce encounter with Haskell, a formidable opponent.

Harry carefully observed Haskell, who was vigilant and armed with a rifle nearby. Harry, determined to avenge his brother's robbery, decided to hold Haskell until reinforcements arrived. Despite his anger and the urgency of the situation, Harry relied on his superior senses to outwit Haskell. As darkness enveloped them, Harry stealthily moved away, dodging a bullet in the process. He crawled silently, using his acute hearing to detect Haskell's movements.

He remained cautious, knowing any noise could alert Haskell. After a quarter of an hour, he felt safe and stood behind a large tree, reveling in the luxury of being a free man. Triumph surged through him, feeling the stars were on his side. He stretched to ease the stiffness from crawling, then couldn't resist shouting in celebration. Running recklessly, crashing through bushes, unafraid of Haskell, armed and confident in the woods. After a few hundred yards, he slowed, moving silently with forester instincts. Grateful for fate leading him towards Lee, he descended a slope, knees buckling from exhaustion. Resting, he heard an owl hoot, feeling its watchful eyes. Defiantly, he challenged the owl, refusing to be intimidated. Despite the owl's ominous hoots, he vowed to persevere, undeterred by the night's eerie sounds.|"['1.

Harry's excitement overwhelmed him, causing a rush of blood to his head. Staring at the owl with its cold, red-rimmed eyes, he felt a superstitious fear creep over him. Thoughts of ominous poems about ravens and albatrosses haunted him. Determined, he readied his rifle to slay the owl, but a sudden fear of the albatross stopped him. Shaken, he felt as if he had narrowly avoided a terrible deed. Refreshing himself by a brook, Harry regained his strength and continued his journey. Soon, he encountered cavalry from his own army. Urgently, he informed the colonel of his crucial message for General Lee. Quickly mounted on a horse, he sped towards the commander-in-chief, accompanied by a group of soldiers.

The recent news informs us that the Army of Northern Virginia, despite their bravery, did not succeed in capturing all the Northern positions at Gettysburg. Without complete success, General Lee is likely retreating. I trust that you, my dear son Harry, emerged unscathed from the battle.

We still possess a formidable army in the West, resilient and formidable. I have been spared in many battles and remain well. It seems fate has separated us in this war, you in the East and I in the West, under the guidance of providence. I am comforted by your association with great soldiers like Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. Pendleton reports tranquility in his area, though guerilla bands in the mountains cause trouble.

"George, I'm older than you by two months, and sometimes that small difference matters a lot, especially for us. I see a bit of immaturity in you, Harry, that I feel the need to help you grow out of."" George paused before replying, ""Harry, can you promise to keep a very important secret?

Whispering with satisfaction, the man observed the signs of nervousness in someone tall and powerful who had broken three twigs of pine absentmindedly. The man, known as Shepard, seemed to lurk in the shadows, evading capture despite a thorough search by soldiers. Documents went missing, causing alarm throughout the Confederacy. The man's daring and resourcefulness posed a threat as he struck from the shadows, stealing critical dispatches and earthwork plans. Harry, determined to find Shepard, was convinced of his presence in Richmond. The General was informed of the situation, and a city-wide search ensued to apprehend the elusive spy and burglar.|"['1.

Harry was certain the man was Shepard and felt determined to capture him, despite liking him. Knowing Shepard faced hanging if caught, Harry understood the risks of being a spy. Meanwhile, General Lee shifted his camp to the Opequan and later to Front Royal due to maneuvers by General Meade. With no orders to rejoin Lee, Harry and Dalton enjoyed their time in Richmond with the Lanhams, who refused payment. The days in Richmond passed pleasantly, with the Mosaic Club members treating them well. As August arrived, they received news from Harry's father in Georgia hinting at a significant move by Bragg's army. The focus shifted to the West, where the Confederacy faced challenges.

The conversation shifted to new books imported from Europe on blockade runners. Members of the Mosaic Club dove into critiques of novels by Dickens and Thackeray. Harry, certain that Shepard was the spy, took it upon himself to catch him. Despite warnings about wasting time, he persisted, haunted Richmond at night, and finally spotted Shepard near army headquarters. As Shepard tried to slip away, Harry refrained from shouting and decided to confront him. Following Shepard into dark alleys, Harry unexpectedly received a blow to the jaw, losing consciousness. When he awoke in a dimly lit room, bandaged and sore, he realized the fight against the spy was far from over.|"['1.

Harry woke up in a small, plain room that he assumed belonged to a woman. Despite feeling a bit of regret, he realized he was not seriously hurt. He chuckled at how easily he fell into Shepard's trap. He pondered on how he ended up in the woman's room and why he was there. His boots were on the floor, and he noticed the room was tidy, likely belonging to an unmarried woman. As he tried to sit up, his throbbing head forced him back down. He contemplated Shepard's revenge punch and his current predicament. The rain outside made him question if he was still in Richmond. Suddenly, Henrietta Carden entered, revealing a caring side to her. Harry, feeling grateful, explained his situation and awaited his guardian's arrival.|"['1.

It's essential to stick to the story of the fall, a situation that could happen to anyone in dim streets. Miss Carden displayed genuine human compassion and offered assistance. The group had their own keys to the Lanham house, entering quietly without disturbing anyone. The following day, their explanations were accepted without issue, and Harry's jaw healed quickly, though his morale was low. The theft of important documents stopped abruptly, likely due to Harry's encounter with Shepard, prompting Shepard to leave the city. Harry was later tasked with delivering messages from the president to General Lee near the Opequan. After a pleasant stay in Richmond, Harry returned to the Army of Northern Virginia, reuniting with his comrades. The North was amassing forces, preparing for a fierce battle.

Harry and his friends were elated by the victory at Chickamauga, but Harry couldn't shake the worry that Thomas, with one wing, might still hinder complete success for Bragg. Returning to Richmond, the city was jubilant over the triumph. The news of the Yankee army's defeat in the West lifted spirits. The South's fortunes were on the rise, reminiscent of Stonewall Jackson's past victories. Despite the celebrations, Harry's fears were confirmed as Thomas stood his ground, and Bragg failed to capitalize fully on the victory. The war was far from over, and both sides were unable to invade each other with ease. The Army of Northern Virginia settled in for autumn and winter at Clarke's Mountain. The soldiers enjoyed a period of peace and recovery, surrounded by the healing scent of pines and cedars. It was a rare time of rest in the midst of the ongoing conflict.|"[""1.

General Lee was not just a great commander to Harry; he was also a revered hero. Harry believed that only Napoleon, in his earlier days, had received a similar level of trust and admiration. The soldiers who had felt General Lee's leadership in battle now saw him in person for the first time. His appearance and manner commanded respect, but what truly set him apart was his unwavering patience, willingness to take responsibility, and unmatched military brilliance. The Southern people held him in such high regard that his stature only grew with time, much like Lincoln's. Harry often rode alongside him, noticing the general's fondness for young staff members and elderly soldiers. During a ride to Stuart's camp near the Rapidan, General Lee expressed his longing for his ancestral home, Arlington, now held by the enemy. Despite the war's challenges, his love for the land and its significance to Virginians and Kentuckians remained strong.

Dressed in a dazzling new uniform with a broad yellow sash, embroidered tunic, and gold-laden epaulets, Stuart exuded a medieval charm. His hat adorned with thick gold braid and buckskin gloves tapped his yellow riding boots with a whip. Stuart's demeanor, reminiscent of medieval knights, delighted in the chase and pranks. Offering provisions captured from a Yankee outpost, including Yorkshire ham and cove oysters, Stuart highlighted the abundance of forage in Virginia and Kentucky, reminiscing about the ease of forest living.

General Stuart announced that dinner was ready and offered only boxes and kegs to sit on, assuring that the Northern food, some canned, was excellent. He shared a story about an aide sent by 'Old Jube' to deliver a dispatch to General Hill, who was ambushed by a stage villain. Another aide sent as a backup also faced the same fate. The villain, identified as Shepard, read the dispatch and got angry at the unnecessary work. General Early, upon hearing the news, exploded with unprecedented swear words. He then sent two sharpshooters with a copy of the dispatch, but they too were ambushed by the villain, Dick Turpin, who had a repeating rifle.

General Lee and his aides rode back, the commander seemingly in high spirits. Stuart, known for his daring, amused Lee with tales of a Yankee spy. Despite disliking Early's swearing, Lee laughed heartily. Stuart, in his plumed hat and heroic uniform, looked like a knight. Lee, usually enamored with nature, seemed lost in thought, perhaps realizing the Confederacy's dire situation after Gettysburg and Vicksburg.

The preacher at the gathering possessed great power and sincerity, leading a massive chorus of thirty to forty thousand voices after the sermon. Harry was deeply moved by the unity of the men, mostly young lads who were seasoned veterans. As they sang, Harry felt the presence of his lost hero, Stonewall Jackson. While Harry and Dalton searched for their companions, they noticed a familiar figure clad in a Confederate uniform singing fervently. Harry realized it was Shepard, a dangerous spy.

Harry felt a mix of emotions as he watched Julien de Langeais play the violin with extraordinary skill. Despite not understanding the technicalities of music, Harry recognized the mastery in de Langeais' performance. The music transported him to a realm of imagination, away from the thousands of soldiers and cannons around them. Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire whispered to Harry about de Langeais' background as a musician who chose to fight in the army. Harry pondered on the vulnerability of such a talented artist on the battlefield, where a stray bullet could end his life and deprive the world of his genius forever.

Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire spoke highly of young de Langeais, mentioning his family's wealth and plans for his education in Paris after the war.

Harry and Dalton chose to copy his actions and rest under the pine trees with their blankets. Harry quickly found a cozy spot, laid out his blankets, and soon fell into a deep sleep. The entire Army of Northern Virginia behaved like a close-knit family, sleeping early, resting well, and waking with the sunrise. The next day, frost covered the grass, but the boys, resilient as they were, were unaffected. As autumn progressed, the leaves turned vibrant colors before falling in the brisk winds. The soldiers, feeling the chill in the air, built bigger fires. Despite the nearness of the Army of the Potomac, both sides hesitated to attack. The soldiers' thoughts shifted to the Southwest, where news of Grant's victories loomed. Despite the challenges faced by the Confederacy, the soldiers in the Army of Northern Virginia remained resolute under Lee's leadership.|"['1.

As spring approached, Harry noticed the signs of impending action. Grant, who had been in the East visiting his ill daughter, was preparing to lead a massive force against the Confederacy. The North buzzed with activity as preparations intensified. Grant, accompanied only by his young son, arrived in Washington unnoticed and humbly registered at a hotel. Meanwhile, Lee, with his smaller force, anticipated the impending clash. As May arrived, the Army of Northern Virginia seemed relaxed, with soldiers playing games and enjoying the spring weather. However, Harry, in the commander-in-chief's tent, knew the reality of the situation. Lee's concern for supplies was evident, as he expressed worries to the President of the Confederacy about the army's provisions. Despite the calm atmosphere, the looming battle weighed heavily on everyone's minds.|"['1.

Harry had pondered over a letter for a long time. He knew its absolute truth from his own observations. The South was depleted and unable to feed its troops well. The abundance of the previous autumn had quickly vanished, and during winter, they mostly had half rations. Lee, better than anyone else in the South, understood the challenges ahead. He had written to a young woman in Virginia, urging her to remember the Army of Northern Virginia in her prayers. As the eve of significant events approached, Lee sent messengers to all parts of his army. Harry, deeply grateful for serving under men like Stonewall Jackson and Lee, felt the weight of the impending Civil War crisis. Lee, a man of great military and soulful greatness, prepared for the looming struggle. As night fell, Lee and his generals met, discussing plans as the sounds of marching men and moving cannons filled the air.

Lee's plan was unfolding smoothly as his three corps advanced towards the old battlefield of Chancellorsville. Grant's Union forces were being drawn into the Wilderness, much like Hooker's fate the year before. Harry, foreseeing the unfolding events, felt a mix of excitement and dread. The Wilderness, akin to Belgium in Europe, became the battleground of North America. Grant's seasoned army, with veterans of victory and defeat, advanced towards Lee's forces. Colonel Winchester led a veteran regiment, accompanied by his aide Richard Mason and Colonel Hertford with his cavalry. Grant's army was well-equipped, with thousands of wagons carrying supplies and a robust communication system. Lee trusted Grant completely, giving him unprecedented resources to secure victory.

The army's divisions were close but in a land of forests and waters, Northern scouts could appear. Riding cautiously, hand near his pistol, the midday sun clouded. Thickets thickened as the afternoon passed. A distant trumpet call echoed, hidden by the Wilderness. Memories flooded back. A year ago, he rode with Jackson, now armies gathered again. Imagination sparked. Birds chirped, rabbits scattered. Spring bloomed, tinged with red. The illusion of riding to Chancellorsville lingered.

He felt relieved that his horse was well-trained, standing still as Northern scouts passed by. He didn't want to be captured, especially on the eve of a looming battle.

"Harry, listening closely, heard no noise ahead except for the wind rustling through the small forests of the Wilderness. He knew that a battle had not yet started elsewhere. Sound would travel far on that calm May morning, and it was certain that Ewell was closest to the enemy. But Ewell remained still. All his soldiers had eaten breakfast early and stayed in quiet groups, partly concealed by the trees and bushes. The dawn was chilly, but Harry soon felt warmer as the sun rose over the eastern edge of the Wilderness. The light spread upwards, but couldn't pierce the dark thickets. It was almost six o'clock, and General Ewell, growing restless, rode a bit forward. Harry and his team followed. A few Southern sharpshooters suddenly emerged from the bushes, one even dared to touch the general's horse. However, Ewell wasn't upset. He gazed at the man and remarked: ""They're getting ready. They're searching. We've spotted them in the bushes. We advise you not to proceed, General. We'd be lost without you. Look, sir! They're shooting at our sentries!"" Gunshots rang out, with pink flashes and smoke rising. More shots followed on their right and left. The Northern riflemen seemed to be in a long line, testing their enemy's strength thoroughly.

Ewell rode back to the main camp with his staff, where the soldiers were ready, guns in position, waiting for Grant's lieutenant. The forest was silent, tense, waiting for the impending battle. Suddenly, rifle shots and rebel yells signaled the enemy's approach. The bugle sounded, and the battle erupted with thundering guns and rifles. The Northern forces led by General Warren pushed the Southern division back. Amidst the chaos, Ewell, a seasoned veteran, urged his men to stand firm. Despite the fierce fight, the Southern soldiers, though forced back, held their ground with valor. The Wilderness became a battleground, ablaze with the fury of war.

Harry pondered if the assault at other spots had the same impulsive nature. The noise and commotion were so intense that he couldn't hear the battle sounds elsewhere. Despite many men falling, the general remained unscathed, along with the young lieutenant and his horse. A sudden shout erupted, followed by the rebel yell, indicating reinforcements. Gray regiments charged down paths, and cavalry under Sherburne thundered on the left flank. Ewell's division, now reinforced, charged towards the Northern bayonets. The battle was fierce, with cannon fire and bursting shells. Ewell's men gained ground, capturing cannons and driving Warren's troops back. Victory seemed to favor the South. As Harry rode away, the battle continued behind him. Despite stray shells, he and his horse remained unharmed. The battle was moving towards the main Union lines, showing Ewell's success.

Harry stayed at the back on his horse, observing the intense battle. The day grew darker, either from clouds or the thick smoke, making it hard to see. The fight was chaotic, happening under harsh conditions. The cavalry sometimes got knocked off by bushes, not bullets. Infantrymen waded through muddy fields, charging forward. The cannons got stuck, needing men and horses to free them. Grant kept reinforcing his experienced soldiers, while Hill, though unable to advance, stood firm. The challenging terrain Lee chose helped him avoid being outflanked. Harry spotted Hill, a brave fighter despite his wounds. As night approached and Grant struggled to make progress, Lee received news of Ewell's success. The battle in the Wilderness was fierce, but Harry knew the real clash would come the next day.|"['1.

On a dark and eerie night, Harry rode through the thickets behind the Confederate line, the air thick with battle smoke. The frogs' croaks seemed like funeral dirges for the impending ruin. The damp ground and bitter vapors added to the ominous atmosphere. As he rode, Harry encountered riflemen and a sense of danger loomed. In the lonely gap between Hill and Longstreet, the Wilderness felt haunted. Harry, feeling the presence of danger, took shelter in the thicket, suspecting he was pursued by the skilled Union spy, Shepard. Despite the peril, Harry remained calm and prepared, listening intently for any sign of danger, relying on his keen senses to outwit his pursuer.|"['1.

He stayed motionless for a full ten minutes, testing his endurance and silence while waiting for an invisible danger. Every minute was precious as he needed to reach General Longstreet quickly for the morning battle. Despite the ongoing duel with Shepard, he lay close to the earth, listening for any sounds.

He rode swiftly through the night, outpacing Shepard, his rival, and outwitting him once again. Harry, a young lieutenant, made a wide circle to avoid any potential ambush from Shepard, who sought revenge for his defeat. Riding through the darkness, Harry encountered only the sounds of the wilderness, with startled deer and darting rabbits crossing his path. Eventually, he reached the Southern sentinels and was led to General Lee's camp.

The crackling fire intensified, echoing the response of Southern rifles. Field guns and heavier batteries joined in, causing leaves and men to fall. Amid the gloomy Wilderness, 200,000 men clashed in battle under a gray dawn. The smoke from the fierce conflict hung low, mixing with the smell of gunpowder. Grant's powerful army aimed to overwhelm Lee. The Northern artillery targeted the Southern forces, while Hancock led the charge with determination. Despite the chaos, Hancock remained composed, strategically attacking Longstreet's corps. As the battle raged, a gap formed in the Southern army, unnoticed by Hancock due to the dense smoke.

In the heat of battle, the Invincibles charged into the fiery chaos, disappearing from Harry's sight. Urged by duty, Harry swiftly rode to Longstreet, carrying a crucial message to close the gap between their forces and Hill's. Dodging bullets and shells, the air thick with acrid fumes, he reached Longstreet, who understood the urgency. Together, they pushed against Hancock's fierce defense, the Southern troops displaying their fearless resolve. Amidst the chaos, a tragic mistake occurred as Longstreet was wounded by friendly fire, causing confusion among the troops. Lee swiftly took command, rallying the division for a renewed attack. The battle raged on, with both sides fiercely contesting every inch of ground, the forest ablaze with the fires of war.

Harry, accustomed to battle, understood the need for silence and stillness. Grant faced losses and sought better ground, unable to use his numbers advantageously. Lee, unable to capitalize on his successful defense, missed the days of strategic maneuvers. Stuart, the skilled cavalryman, lacked the numbers and brilliance of Jackson. As the sun rose higher, the armies remained still. The Wilderness, scarred by war, was mournful. Coals smoldered, bushes lay in heaps, and surgeons tended to the wounded. Lee's staff prepared for another assault. The Invincibles were to regroup with new recruits. Scouts reported the Union army preparing to leave. Lee deliberated, then decided to act.

Their path meandered through torn, twisted, and charred thickets. Occasionally, a horse would abruptly veer to the side, neighing in agony. The ground beneath their hooves was scorching hot, leaving a trail of fire. Despite the sparks raining down on them, they pressed forward, delivering sealed orders to General Anderson. He swiftly assembled his troops and marched away from the heart of the Wilderness towards Spottsylvania Court House.
