"Aunt Jane nostalgically shared, ""In my time, it was 'Little boys should be seen and not heard.' But times change."" Concerned, Mrs. Dolman cautioned about offering wine to children, fearing early exposure could lead to future issues. She emphasized the importance of setting a good example by being teetotalers.

Mr. Delaney's sister, Mrs. Dolman, expressed concern about the neglected and absurd behavior of the children. She suggested that Mr. Delaney should go on an expedition to the Himalayas with a friend and leave the children in her care. Mrs. Dolman assured him that she would look after the children as her own and raise them in a God-fearing manner. Mr. Delaney was convinced by her sincerity and the letter from his friend about the expedition. The next morning, Mr. Delaney woke up to find his chest occupied by his son, Orion, and his daughters, Diana, Iris, and Apollo, surrounding him on the bed.

"Mr. Delaney, after a moment of silence, spoke up, ""It appears that you all have given me quite the fright. I am relieved to wake and find that the creatures were only my children. But why the early disturbance?"" Diana chimed in, ""Father, we must consider the innocent creatures like the birds, mice, and frogs, along with our pets."" Orion added, ""She was upset with me because I'm big and sometimes have no eyes. I found her behavior silly."" Iris explained, ""We brought the younger ones because we thought it best.

""Well, children, I am very sorry for you, but it is too late to do anything now. The whole thing is arranged. I hope you will try to be good, and also to be happy with Aunt Jane.

""Please don't say any more, father,"" interrupted Iris. She slipped off the bed and stood very pale and still, looking at her father with eyes which, notwithstanding all her efforts, were full of reproach.

""Yes, father, go to sleep,"" echoed Diana. ""I understand all about it. You won't have any hobgoblins now to dream about, for I have got off your knees. They were lovely and flat, and I didn't mind sitting on them one bit.""

""All the same, Diana, I am obliged to you for getting off,"" said Mr. Delaney, ""for I was beginning to get quite a terrible cramp, to say nothing of my sensations at having this giant Orion planting himself on my chest.

In a beautiful garden, four children were the happiest ever. When they entered, it felt like an extra ray of sunshine brightened the world with joy and beauty. Bees buzzed, flowers bloomed, and animals gathered around them. They had a special shed called the dead-house for deceased creatures. The children decided on public or private funerals or burial in dock leaves. They prepared coffins for the dead animals with care. After the solemn ceremonies, Apollo eagerly wanted to resume work on his ship. He planned to use canvas to build a funnel and a steam engine. He asked Iris if she would like to see his ship sail, eager to share his creation with her.|['1.

Mr. Delaney suggested that Orion might as well be the thief if something had to be stolen. He then proposed that they witness a ceremony in the garden where the children were preparing for a pet's funeral. As they walked and talked, Orion announced the start of the public funeral. The children, led by Apollo, were holding a ceremony for Rub-a-Dub, a pet, complete with a grave and a tiny coffin. The mourners, including Diana and Iris, sang a farewell song as they buried Rub-a-Dub. Mrs. Dolman, unimpressed by the children's actions, remarked to Mr. Delaney that she was relieved he was leaving abroad and that the children would be under her care.

Mr. Delaney handed over his children to Jane with a heavy heart, hoping she wouldn't spoil them. The Rectory at Super-Ashton was a bright and spacious house, well-managed by Mrs. Dolman, a determined and active woman. Her husband, Mr. Dolman, was a kind but less enthusiastic figure. The household was abuzz when Mrs. Dolman announced the arrival of the four Delaney children. The Dolman children, Lucy, Mary, Ann, Philip, and Conrad, eagerly awaited their cousins' arrival. With their mother's return imminent, the children maintained composure at the breakfast table.

Mr. Dolman read a letter from his wife, asking for the wagonette and cart to pick her up from the station. He mentioned how he was glad she was coming home as he felt bothered by parishioners in her absence. The children, led by Miss Ramsay, went for a walk after lessons. Despite the heat, they returned for dinner at one o'clock, displaying good manners. Mr. Dolman discussed sleeping arrangements for the children with Miss Ramsay, following Mrs. Dolman's instructions. He then left for a parish visit, bidding the children goodbye. Lessons resumed until tea at five, after which Ann struggled with French poetry and fell asleep.

Miss Ramsay left the room. Ann shed a few tears, and then, seeing there was no help for it, applied herself with all her might and main to learning her appointed task. She got her poetry by heart after a fashion, and, hastily replacing the book in the bookcase, ran out of the schoolroom. She saw Lucy and Mary pacing up and down the terrace in front of the house. They were in clean white frocks, with sashes round their waists, and their hair was very trimly brushed and curled over their heads.

""Well, Miss Ann, my heart is not racing like yours. But, Miss, if I may advise you, keep your feelings to yourself, especially around your mother. She wants you to be calm and well-behaved.""

Lucy and Mary were just like their mother, always obedient and well-mannered. They never questioned her rules. As little Ann came closer, they seemed to ignore her.

Mrs. Dolman was tired after a long journey with her unruly little cousins, the Delaneys. Iris was the only one who behaved well, but her brothers and sister were extremely naughty.

Diana whispered to Orion about running away, but Mrs. Dolman caught on and directed them to follow her daughter, Mary, to get cleaned up by the servant, Simpson.

Philip approached Diana, teasing her about being punished. Iris blushed slightly, the first warm welcome she had received. She extended her hand to Ann silently as they entered the lively Rectory. The four new children, led by Mary and Ann, headed upstairs to meet Simpson. Initially cross about the additional children, Simpson's heart softened seeing Diana's weariness, Iris' tears, and Orion's defiance. Diana boldly declared her dislike for cousins and nurses, urging Philip to inform his mother for punishment. Iris intervened, explaining Diana's hardships and asking for understanding. Overwhelmed, Diana embraced Iris, shedding tears. Iris requested bread and milk for Diana and suggested putting her to bed. Simpson, impressed by Iris' kindness, agreed.

Apollo and Diana, two siblings, were playing in the grass when Diana had a mischievous idea. She wanted to make a bow and arrow to shoot things in the woods. Apollo, being older, knew this was wrong but agreed to help make the bow. Diana found some string, and soon they had a bow ready. Apollo then crafted an arrow from a stick. Despite lacking a tip, the arrow was sharp. Apollo suggested having a few practice shots. The next day, the children's lessons with Miss Ramsay at the Rectory proved to be a challenge. Unlike their previous pleasant lessons with Miss Stevenson, the new teacher brought a stricter approach. The children quickly learned that Miss Ramsay was not to be taken lightly.|"['1.

At breakfast the next morning, Diana was forced to speak only in French, a language she struggled with. She missed her usual cheerful chatter, making the meal gloomy. After breakfast, the children headed to the hot schoolroom. Miss Ramsay, their governess, addressed the kids, emphasizing the importance of paying attention during lessons. She warned of consequences for not preparing their tasks. The children settled down as Miss Ramsay began a lesson on English history, captivating Iris but leaving Apollo distracted.

Diana didn't want to explore anywhere outside her current residence. Her mind was occupied with Apollo's hidden bow and arrow in the woods.

When reprimanded by Miss Ramsay, Diana showed defiance, refusing to engage with her geography lesson. Her behavior led to punishment, but she remained unapologetic.

Orion, however, did not glance at Simpson. He gazed solemnly round the room as if he really saw someone; then he fixed his brown eyes on his sister's face, then he opened his mouth very wide.

In the story, Diana and Orion were taken by Mother Rodesia and sold to a circus manager named Ben Holt. They were quickly taken to the southwest of England. Diana found the circus thrilling, with performances by circus girls, a clown named Tom, an elephant, a donkey, and a troop of talented dogs. Diana enjoyed the attention she received from the circus girls, while Orion stuck close to Aunt Sarah. They were not allowed to attend the public performance but could hear the cheers from their room. After the show, the circus packed up and left for the west of England. Meanwhile, the police searched for Diana and Orion, and their family was distraught. Aunt Jane, who had mistreated Iris and Apollo, became gentle and remorseful.

Aunt Jane faced a terrible moment, too shocked to respond to her husband. Despite his brief satisfaction at outsmarting her, Aunt Jane later confronted the staff and parishioners. Iris, however, underwent a sad transformation. She grew thin, pale, and ate little, hardly speaking. Even Apollo and little Ann couldn't console her. Miss Ramsay noticed Iris' distress and suggested a doctor. Mrs. Dolman, feeling overwhelmed by the Delaney children, worried about Iris. She dismissed Miss Ramsay's concerns, believing the children would be found soon. Weeks after Orion and Diana vanished, Iris entered Mrs. Dolman's uninviting study, looking frail and troubled.

Mrs. Dolman was deeply concerned about her niece Iris, who seemed unwell and distressed. Determined to get her the help she needed, Mrs. Dolman took Iris to see Dr. Kent, a kind and skilled young doctor in their village. Dr. Kent examined Iris thoroughly and then had a private conversation with Mrs. Dolman. He explained that Iris was not physically ill but was under severe mental strain, which could be life-threatening if not addressed. Dr. Kent attributed this to Iris's delicate and nervous nature, compounded by the recent loss of her mother.

Dr. Kent advised Mrs. Dolman that her daughter's illness was worsened by not expressing her grief for her mother's loss. He emphasized the urgent need to inform Mr. Dolman about the missing children.

Mr. Dolman and Mrs. Dolman were discussing a plan to keep Iris alive, which involved taking her and Apollo around. Mrs. Dolman questioned the need for Apollo to go since he was healthy. However, Mr. Dolman believed Iris would confide in Apollo, and he insisted on taking her. Mrs. Dolman acknowledged her mistakes in handling the children and agreed to the plan. They decided to start that afternoon to find the children themselves. Iris, overwhelmed with gratitude, promised to be a better caretaker. Mr. Dolman's proposal seemed correct, and they planned to leave for Super-Ashton by the three o'clock train.

Diana excelled in her performances and pleased Ben Holt, but Orion struggled to follow her lead. Unlike his sister, Orion lacked the courage and skill needed for the circus acts. He was a timid boy with a fearful demeanor, especially when it came to riding Greased Lightning, the horse in the show. Ben Holt, the manager, grew impatient with Orion's lack of progress and began to treat him harshly, even resorting to using his whip on the frightened child. Orion's confidence dwindled, and he often found himself trembling and in tears. Susan Jenkins, another performer, noticed Orion's distress and tried to offer him comfort and support. Despite her efforts, Orion's fear overwhelmed him during a performance, causing him to fall off the horse and get hurt.

The dark cage was a bad place where fierce animals were trained. It was a big box with no windows, only a few small vents in the door. Sometimes, angry animals were locked there, but never a child. Suddenly, the door swung open, and brave little Diana walked in. Her brother, Orion, cried for help. Diana, with determination, calmed Orion and bravely faced the chestnut horse. She convinced Uncle Ben to let her handle Orion instead of punishing him. The next day, they were to perform together.

Despite the scare, Diana remained determined and offered to continue the act.

Diana suggested going to the garden to see the dead-house where Rub-a-Dub was kept. They planned to sit on a small bench and count the deceased. Orion, aged six, thought it was okay for Diana to lie on the damp grass under the moonlight. He noticed the distant lights of the town and the circus attractions. Despite his fear of being close to their guardians, he lay down next to Diana for comfort. As they slept, nighttime creatures like owls and bats emerged, curious about the children in their midst. Orion woke at dawn, remembering their escape from the circus and the need to move farther away. He tried to wake Diana, who was deeply asleep, her cheeks flushed with warmth.
