Once upon a time, there were two brothers. The elder one owned a magical quern that could grind anything. When the younger brother saw it, he wanted it too.

The care of Shintô shrines is overseen by the Yoshida and Fushimi families, nobles at the Mikado's court in Kiyôto. The Kanjuji family manages Buddhist affairs. Priests serving the gods must have a certain rank obtained through the noble families, who receive a fee for their services. In China, rank can be bought, unlike in Japan.

Long, a tall man, introduced his stout friend Broad to the prince, claiming he could widen himself. Skeptical, the prince asked for a demonstration. Broad inflated himself, urging the prince to ride into the forest. Confused but following Long's lead, the prince galloped away just in time as Broad expanded, filling the area like a mountain. After retracting, Broad created a strong wind, returning the forest to normal. Impressed, the prince invited Broad to join them. As they continued, they encountered Sharpsight, a man with eyes bandaged to control his intense vision. Sharpsight demonstrated his power by making a rock burst into flames and gold.

The prince and his companions rode swiftly towards the iron castle. They were guided by Sharpsight, whose keen eyesight helped them navigate through obstacles. As they approached the castle, they found it guarded by an iron bridge that closed behind them, trapping them inside. The castle was eerie, with richly-dressed stone figures lining the halls. In the supper-room, they found a table set for four, but no one appeared. After eating, they searched for a place to rest. Suddenly, the wizard entered with a beautiful damsel, the princess. The wizard challenged the prince to keep the princess in sight for three nights or face being turned to stone. Determined, the prince and his companions prepared to guard the princess through the night, but they all fell asleep, and the princess vanished. Sharpsight quickly spotted her a hundred miles away, perched atop an oak tree as an acorn. With Long's help, they set off to find her.|"[""1.

After delivering the acorn to the prince, Long was instructed to let it fall on the ground. As the prince obeyed, the princess suddenly appeared beside him. When the sun rose beyond the mountains, the wizard entered the room with a spiteful smile. However, upon seeing the princess, his demeanor changed, and one of his iron hoops splintered off. Leading the princess away, the wizard left the prince to explore the castle, which was frozen in time. Everywhere he looked, he saw figures turned to stone by the wizard's curse. The castle was desolate, with life seemingly lost in a single moment. The prince and his companions were entertained with food and wine that appeared magically. Despite their efforts to stay awake, they all fell asleep. Upon waking, the princess vanished, and the prince learned she had transformed into a precious stone in a mountain. With the help of Long and Sharpsight, they retrieved the stone and restored the princess. The wizard, seeing the princess returned, was again thwarted by the prince's actions.|['1.

"In the morning, the prince woke up early once more, and realizing the princess was missing, he woke up Sharpsight. ""Hey, Sharpsight! Wake up and help me find the princess,"" the prince exclaimed. Sharpsight peered into the distance for a while before responding, ""Oh, she's far away, about three hundred miles. She's in a shell at the bottom of a black sea, and in that shell is a gold ring, which she is. But don't worry, we'll rescue her. Today, Long must bring Broad with us; we'll need him.""

Once upon a time, there was a prince who, with the help of his loyal servants Long, Broad, and Sharpsight, freed a group of gentlemen.
