"Frank Haywood adjusted his glasses and peered into the distance from his saddle. Beside him, his friend Bob Archer, a Kentucky native, tended to his saddle. Frank, the son of Colonel Leonidas Haywood, a wealthy rancher and mine owner, had blue eyes and tawny hair, well-versed in cowboy ways from his time on the plains. Bob, keen on outdoor sports, brought his Kentucky horse, ""Domino,"" to the Southwest. The duo, known as the ""Saddle Boys,"" loved exploring on horseback. They encountered adventures, like solving a cavern mystery in the Rockies. Spotting a dun-colored hide in the grass, they discovered a yearling's remains, predated by wolves. Frank recounted the loss of seven animals to wolves recently, including the lame yearling."|"['1.

"""Why not?"" Frank asked, closing his jaws firmly. ""The day is still ahead of us, and we're ready to hunt down that pack to their den. Look at those rocks a few miles away; that must be where they hide, Bob! It's strange that none of the boys have thought of searching in this area for the old she-wolf Sallie and her pups.""

""Sure thing. You can see where she attacked the yearling. Everyone knows her signature move. She's been causing trouble for the ranches here for years. They call her Sallie in jest, but it's serious now; many would ride miles for a chance to take her down.""

""Old Hank Coombs, on his pony, just as expected! You knew he was coming, but kept quiet. Glad to see him. It might be the day we catch that crafty Sallie and her cubs.""

"""We'll follow the trail, if there is one,"" said Frank immediately. He pointed in the direction of a rocky uplift in the sea of purple sage brush. Old Hank, with years of tracking experience, discovered signs invisible to others. Bob observed closely. After a while, they reached the rocks, a potential den for wild beasts. The odor led them closer to the wolf's den. Old Hank detected signs near a crevice. Frank and Bob prepared to search the rocks. Old Hank sniffed the air, signaling the den's proximity. They found claw marks near a gloomy crevice. Frank and Bob discussed how close the den was to their ranch. They planned to end the she-wolf's reign.

Frank and his friends were preparing to confront the fierce she-wolf, Sallie, in her den. Hank, the experienced cowman, warned them to be ready for a quick shot if needed. Bob, feeling nervous, questioned if they could see with the dim light. As they ventured into the cave, the tension mounted. Suddenly, a deafening roar echoed as Bob and Frank fired their guns. Chaos ensued as the torch fell, Hank was attacked, and the wolf remained a threat. Despite the chaos, they pressed on, determined to face the danger and rid the range of the menacing predator.

Fortunately, Frank remained alert and held onto his rifle firmly, quickly reloading after firing. The young wolf cubs seemed ready to join their mother's attack. Frank unleashed his gun with a deafening noise, while Bob worried about the mother wolf's return. The boys worked together to fend off the advancing wolf cubs. The mother wolf, fatally wounded, had collapsed close by. The boys were relieved that the ranch was safe from the wolves' harm. Hank praised Bob for his brave actions. They noticed Domino's unease at the scent of the wolf skin. Hank, with his well-trained horse, carried the wolf pelt back to the ranch. As they rode back, they met Ted Conway, a cowboy, who informed Frank of his father's urgent message. Frank feared the worst and asked Ted if his father was hurt or worse.|"['1.

The Colonel had a leg injury, and a doctor from Arrowhead Ranch was attending to him. A messenger from town urgently called Frank back to the ranch, possibly due to a cattle shipment issue.

Frank expressed his concerns to his dad, Colonel Haywood, about the urgent message delivered by Ted, revealing that his father had injured his leg again. Colonel Haywood introduced Mr. Hinchman, a resident of Mohave City, who had found a sealed bottle containing a message from Colonel Haywood's long-lost uncle, Felix. The message indicated that Felix was located near the Grand Canyon in a place called Echo Cave, where he was exploring the history of ancient cliff dwellers. Felix, aware of the passage of time, sought to communicate with his nephew through the floating bottle. Colonel Haywood emphasized the importance of finding Felix within a month to secure a significant sum for his cousin Janice.

Circumstances are unfolding where a fortune might come into her possession, the stockman shared. The clock is ticking, and if the signature doesn't appear, others, especially her deceitful cousin Eugene Warringford, will benefit. Remember him, Frank? He was snooping around a year ago, asking questions as if he was tracing his uncle's steps out here, only to lose the trail. The ranch owner was right; the message was concise and to the point, penned in a crabbed hand, typical of an elderly man absorbed in scientific research. Bob, the cattleman, affirmed the letter's authenticity. The sender, believed to be in the Grand Canyon, is a mystery they plan to unravel. The idea of a long ride to the Grand Canyon thrilled the boys. They aim to explore Echo Cave in search of Uncle Felix. Abajo, a cow-puncher, eavesdropped on their plans, sparking suspicion due to his sly demeanor, despite his roping and riding skills.|"['1.

"""Hey, boss,"" Abajo said with a grin, ""I wanted to talk about that job from yesterday. Pete and I found the missing stock in a valley ten miles away from Thunder Mountain in Fox Canyon.

Abajo's father added, ""He couldn't have heard much, not knowing about Uncle Felix. But talk of a valuable mine would catch his interest. Abajo is always looking for easy money.""

Two friends were deep in conversation, discussing their mission to the region of the world's greatest natural wonder. They also chatted about recent visitors and the valor of the Prescott sheriff. Suddenly, a shrill yell startled them, and they reached for their rifles upon hearing the horses snort loudly. Bob, still new to the Western country, recognized the value of horses and the severity of stealing them. In the dim moonlight, they cautiously ventured out of their tent, suspecting a possible bear or horse thief. Frank warned Bob to be cautious, as horse thieves could distract while stealing. They heard strange sounds, suspecting a Moqui Indian nearby. Frank speculated that the noises were not a ploy to lure them away. They suspected that one of their horses, Buckskin, might have kicked someone, possibly a Moqui Indian.|"[""1.

Bob admitted feeling silly for being bothered by the half-breed's sly face and glittering eyes. His chum reassured him that they would be fine exploring the canyon the next day, and any worries would fade as they marveled at the sights. Bob hinted at his dad's mysterious behavior with Hank, suggesting they might unexpectedly meet friends. Remembering Hank's help in the past, Bob hoped for his presence again. The boys explored the canyon's astonishing features and were awed by its vastness. Bob likened it to a volcano, while Frank pointed out Navajo Peak in the distance. They hired a guide named John Henry to lead them into the canyon, keeping their true purpose secret. As they descended into the canyon, Bob was struck by the immense scale of everything around them.|"[""1.

Bob and Frank were exploring the Grand Canyon, searching for a hermit-scientist's cave. Equipped with field glasses, they marveled at the rainbow-colored walls and ancient cliff dwellings. Climbing upwards, they navigated narrow passages and investigated the old rooms, noting signs of fire use by the ancient inhabitants. Frank hoped studying these dwellings would lead them to the hermit's hidden abode. Despite the risky climb, the boys, with steady nerves, explored the interconnected rooms along the cliff face. As they ventured deeper, Bob expressed his preference for living in a Hopi Indian adobe house or a Navajo hogan due to the sturdy construction of the ancient cliff dwellings, free from leaking roofs.|"['1.

Frank explained to Bob that it's always important to be cautious, especially when climbing steep cliffs. He mentioned how their guide, John Henry, was prepared with a rope in case Bob felt dizzy, similar to Swiss guides. Frank emphasized the importance of safety and prevention, stating that it's better to be safe than sorry. Despite Frank's concerns about being watched, they continued exploring the Grand Canyon, with Frank noting the odd behavior of their guide. As they discussed the direction they were heading, Frank revealed that they were following an old Moqui Indian who had been seen heading east, hinting at a possible connection to money.

""There are many other tourists camping nearby,"" he mentioned. ""Even the county sheriff is in the canyon. It seems safe, but if you want to stand guard, that's fine.""

Frank handed over the promised payment for the week. ""No hard feelings. Next time, be cautious about accepting money to betray friends,"" he advised.

As they walked away, Bob commented, ""Good riddance! We're on our own now. Let's find a guide. We'll ask every group we meet.""

Bob was about to shout out to ask what was happening when his friend grabbed him tightly. A large rock tumbled down the cliff, causing a small avalanche. Frank explained that he had heard rocks falling all day, making him nervous. He suspected that the big rock had been deliberately pushed. Bob was worried that someone might be trying to harm them. As they continued their journey, Charley, their guide, shared that he had been delivering food to a mysterious person in the canyon every two months.

"""It must be Professor Oswald!"" exclaimed Frank.

""Did you happen to notice, Charley, whether this party you are working for is a bald-headed man? Has he a shining top when he takes his hat off; and does he bend over, as if he might be hunting for diamonds all the time?""

""That him, velly much, just same say. Shiny head, and blob this away alle time,"" with which he walked slowly forward, bending over as though trying to discover a rich vein of gold in the seamed rock under his feet.

The next morning, they had a modest breakfast. Frank asked Charley Moi about a distant shout he heard the previous night, suspecting it was a human voice.

Frank explained to his friends that the tracks they were following belonged to an Indian, specifically a Havasupai, based on the unique toe-in pattern of the moccasin prints.

Bob marveled at the idea of the old Moqui reaching Uncle Felix's cliff hideout. Frank pointed out a crevice in the cliff that could have been used to access the dwellings.
