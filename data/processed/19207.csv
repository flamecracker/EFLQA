"Adults often believe they know best, but as a child, I found their rules quite arbitrary. I knew a bit of dirt on my face didn't affect my supper. Washing was a nuisance, yet my mother insisted. Eating should be for pleasure, not just nourishment, but my mom disagreed. She locked the pantry and enforced meal schedules. I preferred eating when I felt like it, even if it meant some discomfort. Despite these differences, I believe adults have a childlike side. This is why I enjoyed the ""Firelight Fairy Book"" and shared it with others. The book's tales captivated me, reminding me of the joy fairy tales bring. I hope this book sparks the imagination of many more children, just as it did for me."|"['1.

On the fifth morning, a fishing boat got caught in an enchanted whirlpool near Dragondel's castle. The boat vanished as the whirlpool disappeared, leaving the sea in turmoil.

Hardly had the Enchanter finished speaking when the witch-fires dashed towards him in a dance from all corners of the marsh. They revealed a faint path across the bog leading to the castle, disappearing behind them like smoke in the winter air. The ghost-fires escorted the Enchanter to his castle gates before soaring into the sky and scattering. Doors opened on their own, strange creatures passed by, and fiery orbs whirled across the courtyard. Just as they were about to enter the castle, the Enchanter turned to Florian, advising him not to fear and to keep courage in his heart. Florian, a brave lad, vowed to keep fear at bay and served the Enchanter faithfully.

One day, as the group rode through a lovely countryside, Florian, also known as Isabella, was close behind the Prince. Suddenly, the Prince spotted a stunning scarlet flower by the road, resembling a scarlet lily. At the same time, the golden bird Florian wore sang a few clear notes.

The Queen finally agreed. The young Prince, who hadn't sneezed again, was taken to a tower on the Golden Mountain. Doctor Pill ensured his room was draft-free and air was sterilized. Mrs. Pill, a former nurse, cared for him. His parents visited thrice a week, wearing germ-proof clothes. The Prince learned various subjects from teachers.

Once upon a time, a kind peasant girl named Marianna came across a wounded yellow bird. She gently healed its injured wing, and to her amazement, the bird burst into a beautiful song and flew out into the sunlight. The bird returned to Marianna, perching on her arm as they journeyed to a distant land. Unbeknownst to Marianna, she was the true queen of this land, stolen by a wicked nobleman named Garabin.

Early on Midsummer Morning, she hurried to the forest, climbed the tall elm, and hid in its top branches. From there, she could see the entire forest below and the distant mountains. She delighted in the morning songs of the birds. As the sun rose, she heard the woodcutter and his crew approaching. When they reached the tree with axes, they were startled by a spirit they thought resided in the tree and fled. The girl stayed hidden all day, but at night, the woodcutter returned.

Late one autumn night, a young queen gazed out of her window at the moonlit meadows. She heard the strange cry of birds flying southward and saw them pass the moon. Soon after, the queen gave birth to a baby boy with wings. The king, superstitious and influenced by an evil chamberlain, believed the queen was a sorceress and ordered her imprisonment and the baby's death. The queen, in a desperate act, leaped from a tower window into the sea, where she transformed into a bird. The jailer, not cruel, took the baby to a family of charcoal-burners.

Twelve years had passed, and the bird-boy had grown into a handsome young man, while Rosabella had blossomed into a beautiful princess. The bird-boy had saved Rosabella twice, once from a yellow viper and another time from falling off a cliff. When war called the King away, the bird-boy begged to go but was left behind to protect the Queen and Rosabella. Soon after, news arrived that the King's army had been defeated, and the enemy was approaching the castle. Malefico, the wicked chamberlain, captured the Queen, Rosabella, and the bird-boy.

Upon hearing the bells and drums, the townspeople rushed to the palace, some clutching their children, others carrying their prized possessions. The palace braced for a siege as black-bearded pirates descended upon the town, ransacking homes, reading letters, and causing chaos. Their goal? To capture the Princess, spurred by the King of the Oyster Mountains. Despite the Princess locking herself away, the pirates persisted, attempting to breach the palace doors.

The elderly lady chuckled and swayed energetically, causing the shells on her hat to rattle. She explained that before venturing into the waters, a magical ring was needed. There were only three rings in existence, and his brothers had the other two. She hesitated but decided to entrust the sailor with her ring to deliver a message to the King of the City under the Sea. She warned him not to ask questions and to follow a specific path north to find the entrance to the city. Once there, he must seek the King but never eat or drink anything offered, as it would make him forget his past. The sailor received the enchanted ring and set off on his journey, finding the cave entrance swiftly. As he descended deeper into the cave, the sounds of the sea faded, and the darkness enveloped him.

Once beneath the waves, the sailor hesitated, unsure of his path. Gradually, his eyes adjusted to the water, revealing a glowing ball of sea-plant on the seabed. Following a line of these lights, he reached the City under the Sea. Inside, dim green light illuminated the town, where people in shimmering scales and golden-ringed eyes roamed. Taken before the King, seated on a coral throne in a grand hall, the sailor learned of a wedding between the King's daughters and his brothers. Yet, his brothers, having eaten the bread of the under-world, did not recognize him. Seated by the youngest daughter, the sailor shared his quest for the Emerald of the Sea, crucial for his father's life. The princess urged him not to forget his mission.|"['1.

"""The Emerald of the Sea has vanished,"" said the young Princess, looking at the sailor with her bright eyes. Long ago, a wicked Prince of the Under-Waters stole it from her father's treasure.

The tired young sailor found himself on a sunken mountain rising from the ocean floor. Hoping to spot the City under the Sea, he decided to climb to the mountain's top. Strange plants and shells dotted the rocks, fish darted past him, and crabs scurried away. At the mountain's ravine, he saw the black ship of the Emerald of the Sea. He quickly boarded the ship and found the Emerald in the captain's cabin. Holding the glowing jewel, he made his way back to the mountainside. As he climbed, the sun's rays illuminated the water, signaling he was close to the surface. Finally, he reached a beautiful island beach. Soon, the princesses and brothers emerged from the water, begging forgiveness and offering water to break the enchantment.|"['1.

Once the sea princesses dried their tears, the sailor and his brothers strategized on how to present the Emerald of the Sea to the King to save their father. To their horror, they realized a grave mistake in timekeeping had led to the King believing their father's life was forfeited three days prior. Despite the sailor's efforts, his father had languished in the dungeon for a year. The King, seeking revenge, ordered the merchant to be cast adrift at sea. Bound and helpless, the merchant drifted until a wind carried him to an island where the sailor and his companions were preparing to return to the sea. They found the merchant alive in the boat. Using the emerald's power, the sailor summoned a ship to take them back home. Landing discreetly, they evaded the King's guards, and the rising tide eventually engulfed the King's palace, leaving only the weather-vane visible before it, too, vanished beneath the waves.|"[""1.
