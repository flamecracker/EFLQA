It was easy to spot the footprints among the fallen rocks. The boys followed the trail diligently, seeing the gray walls ahead. The tower looked like old English masonry with a drawbridge and moat.

"""It's time,"" Arthur added, ""because the hoboes intend to break into the house. Look, that big guy has a rock and seems ready to throw it at the doors."" The collision only made a loud noise, needing many more hits to damage the sturdy doors. Alec whispered that the hoboes were discussing another way in.

Arthur expressed his gratitude to Monkey for his help and suggested moving to the abandoned castle. Hugh recommended occupying the deserted works, and Alec agreed, eager to take pictures before a storm. Alec had brought a flashlight for night photos. The boys marveled at the castle's ruins, imagining medieval knights. Alec decided to take a picture with the sun shining on the walls. He planned to capture more views the next morning.

"""Wow! This place has around forty rooms in total,"" exclaimed Billy, still sweating from their exploration of the mysterious mansion. ""You know, Alec, she wanted it to be quiet, and this place sure fits the bill. It's so silent here that even the chirping of a bird is absent; it's almost eerie.""""Let's hope it stays this quiet tonight,"" said Billy nervously, noticing the amused expressions of the others.

"""We will sleep on the floor tonight, boys,"" Hugh announced as he laid out his blanket. ""If it's too uncomfortable, we might spend the next night outdoors, weather permitting since we lack a tent."" The others quickly followed suit, feeling drowsy.

Hugh had wisely picked up a club before embarking on his investigation mission. Although he didn't expect to use it, he believed in being cautious. Turning around, he shone his torch on his sleeping comrades, none of whom stirred. Standing in the hall, he listened attentively, imagining the castle's past grandeur with suits of armor and relics. As he climbed the stairs, the sounds became clearer, guiding him towards their source. He reached the second floor, stopping to listen for clues. Realizing he was near an unexplored turret, he discovered it was inhabited by owls and bats. Relieved, he closed the door, allowing the creatures to stay. Feeling lighter, he returned to his friends' room, relieved that the mysterious noises were just harmless animals.|"['1.

Late at night, Hugh and Alec were startled by strange sounds in the old castle. Hugh ventured out alone to investigate, leaving Alec behind. When Hugh returned, he explained to Alec that the noises were just owls and bats in the castle. Alec confessed he was too scared to join Hugh in the investigation. They whispered to avoid waking the others. Hugh apologized for not including Alec but explained he wanted to go alone. The boys settled down to sleep, hoping the noisy owls would quiet down.

Hugh informed Billy that there were no ghosts around, giving them the freedom to relax. With the fine weather, Alec proposed they cook outside under the trees for a change. The idea of dining outdoors excited Billy, who loved being in nature. They decided to leave the castle and spend the night under the stars instead of sleeping indoors. Arthur felt melancholic about the castle's history and wanted to leave. As they prepared breakfast over a campfire, Billy jokingly asked if anyone heard a ghost laugh.

They all set out, leaving their belongings hidden in a safe spot. The area around the abandoned castle had returned to its natural state after being left untouched for ten years. Nature covered the scars of man with new growth. The scouts made their way through the dense wilderness to find a perfect camping spot in the woods.

Hugh was captivated by the extraordinary scene unfolding before him. The once abandoned castle now teemed with activity, as figures in medieval attire engaged in a fierce battle. Knights on horseback, armed with lances and swords, clashed with defenders on the walls. Some attackers used primitive weapons, while others attempted to scale the walls only to be pushed back down. A drawbridge had been raised, but the assailants ingeniously constructed a makeshift bridge across the moat. As the chaos subsided, it became clear that the spectacle was a staged performance captured by a cameraman operating a cinematoscope. The students marveled at the elaborate production, realizing the effort and resources dedicated to such theatrical endeavors.

Monkey Stallings was perplexed by the strange coincidence of being at the castle when the actors arrived to film. Hugh suggested that big companies often scout unique locations for their plays.
