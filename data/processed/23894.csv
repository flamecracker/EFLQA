Billie reminded Teddy they couldn't miss the train at eleven. She shifted happily on her footstool, not caring about the old man now that they had the trunk. Teddy, indignant, almost drove into a ditch, scolding Billie for her attitude towards thieves. As they returned to the village, Billie felt guilty for forgetting her friends in the excitement of finding the trunk. In the kitchen, Mrs. Jenkins greeted them warmly, serving breakfast. Billie refused to share details until they ate. Mrs. Jenkins joined in the excitement, enjoying the adventure. Laura and Violet hastily finished breakfast, eager to leave for their next destination. They bid farewell to Mrs. Jenkins, who refused payment, showing her love for the children. Tearfully, they left, waving goodbye to Mrs. Jenkins, who watched them go with a mix of emotions.|"['1.

In the following days, Billie excitedly shared the ghostly events at her inherited homestead with her family.

While strolling with her friend Chet, Billie encountered Miss Beggs, the English teacher whose statue she had accidentally broken. Billie's windfall could now replace the statue, but Amanda Peabody, a disliked girl in town, taunted Billie about her newfound wealth.

Billie calmly agreed not to argue about having a midnight feast at Three Towers, joking about needing a guard to keep watch due to Amanda's snooping abilities.

They laughed and began a lively conversation until Ferd interrupted, wondering why they were hoarding the chocolates. Billie then revealed the untouched box, explaining it was a gift from Amanda Peabody. Billie, noticing Amanda and her look-alike friend, urged Laura to see them at the end of the train car. Laura, mimicking Billie's posture, chuckled at the situation. After securing their belongings, they marveled at the pretty Molata station, the gateway to Three Towers Hall and Boxton Military Academy. The station, surrounded by lush lawns and a glistening fountain, hinted at the town's prosperity. They were ushered to waiting vehicles for their schools, bidding farewell to friends.

"""This road is amazing,"" exclaimed Billie, turning her head to gaze out the window of the vehicle. With two long seats running from the front to the back, Billie accidentally nudged the girl seated next to her, Eliza Dilks, Amanda Peabody's friend. Amanda, with her sneering grin, sat beside Eliza. Billie, noticing Eliza's mean expression and ill-fitting shoes, suggested she move to the other side for more space. The girls chuckled, and Laura quietly praised Billie. As they approached Three Towers Hall, the sight of the majestic towers rising before them made the girls wish they hadn't missed the scenic beauty of Molata. The view of Lake Molata with its shimmering water and inviting sound of wavelets lapping at the bank amazed them. Miss Walters, the head of Three Towers Hall, greeted the girls and introduced Miss Ada Dill, who would guide them through the dormitories.

As they entered the spacious room with many windows, the girls were amazed by the sight of numerous beds. Despite there being only ten, the room seemed to be filled with beds everywhere they looked. Miss Dill assigned three beds to Billie, Laura, and Vi. Each bed had a washbasin and a towel rack with blue and white towels. Outside, they could see the lush lawn and the glistening Lake Molata through the trees. The warm autumn day brought a gentle breeze that rustled the leaves.

Vi exclaimed that they had forgotten lunch and needed to freshen up. She realized they lacked combs. Vi found one in her bag and urged the others to fix their hair.

"Rose assured the girls that they would soon adjust to their new surroundings. She explained that everyone initially disliked a particular teacher, Miss Ada, and another lady, but eventually found them amusing. The girls, Laura especially, preferred Miss Walters to be in charge. Upon reaching the dormitory, they eagerly read the rules together. They discovered that the dormitories were labeled alphabetically, and theirs was ""C."" They found various regulations, including penalties for breaking curfew. The girls were most intrigued by the punishment for leaving lights on after hours. Billie was shocked by the severity of the consequences.

At Three Towers, the girls were thrilled to find a swimming pool, a luxury they had missed out on in North Bend. Billie was excited about the opportunity to finally learn to swim. She wondered if the boys at Boxton Academy had a pool too. The girls were eager to explore the grounds but Rose wanted to know more about the boys. Billie, protective of her brother and friends, didn't want Rose to meet them. The girls learned that older students often taught younger ones to swim, and Connie might become an instructor soon. Billie admired Connie's simplicity and lack of interest in boys, unlike Rose. This sparked Rose's curiosity and a hint of rivalry towards Billie.|['1.

They walked to a small dock that extended into the lake, hidden by trees. Upon reaching it, they were amazed by the sight. Canoes neatly covered with tarpaulin revealed their graceful outlines, tempting the girls to set sail. Billie, with a love for canoes, preferred them over rowboats.
