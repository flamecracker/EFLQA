"While she thought about this, the kids were reading out loud from their strange books. It was odd to see their tiny fingers move so quickly over the pages. Horace found it moving. The superintendent and guests laughed at his mix-up with the word ""sect,"" except for Dotty and Flyaway who didn't find it funny.

"Softly, ma'am! If a drop of tallow should fall on them from that candle, they might take to themselves wings and fly away. That was what Cupid did in the fairy tale, and you are in fairy-land yourself, Mrs. Rosenberg; you are still half asleep.
