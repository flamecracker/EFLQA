One day, Tommy Brock, a fat and bristly creature, caused terror in the woods. He moved from his stick-house to a willow tree, scaring ducks and rats. Tommy wasn't nice; he ate wasp nests and frogs. Despite occasionally eating rabbit-pie, he was generally unfriendly. Old Mr. Bouncer forgot about his rabbit babies, who were just starting to open their eyes. Tommy complained about the scarcity of food and accused others of poaching. Mr. Bouncer laughed and invited Tommy in for cake and wine. Tommy Brock squeezed into the rabbit hole, grinning. Later, Mr. Bouncer found evidence of Tommy's presence and tracked him through the woods. Tommy had left a trail of mischief behind him.|"['1.

"Benjamin hopped over the wall into a meadow, tracking Tommy Brock. As the evening approached, rabbits emerged to enjoy the fresh air. Spotting one rabbit in a blue coat, Benjamin called out to him, realizing it was his cousin Peter Rabbit. Peter, reflecting on the situation, noted that despite Uncle Bouncer's lack of judgment, there were hopeful signs. Tommy Brock had likely eaten and might doze off, sparing Benjamin's family. Peter knew Tommy Brock had likely headed to Mr. Tod's other house atop Bull Banks. As they climbed the hill, they found Tommy Brock's tracks, indicating he had rested frequently. Approaching Mr. Tod's home cautiously, they noticed fresh footprints and heard snoring inside. Peering through the window, they saw someone asleep in Mr. Tod's bed, curled up under a blanket. ""He's asleep in his boots,"" Peter whispered."|"[""1.

As the sun disappeared behind the horizon, an owl's hoot echoed through the dark woods. Unpleasant things scattered around; rabbit bones, chicken legs, and other eerie remnants lay exposed. The atmosphere was unsettling, cloaked in darkness. Attempting to open the kitchen window, they struggled in the dim light. Peter and Benjamin, after much deliberation, decided to dig a tunnel. Hours passed as they burrowed beneath the kitchen floor. Exhausted, they emerged at sunrise. However, in a moment of panic, they sought refuge under Mr. Tod's kitchen floor. Meanwhile, Mr. Tod, in a foul mood, trudged up Bull Banks. An unfortunate night had left him irritable. As he stomped along, a persistent jay bird alerted the rabbits of danger. Frustrated, Mr. Tod's temper flared as he marched onwards.|"['1.

Mr. Tod cautiously approached his house with a large, rusty key in hand. He hesitated, unsure if the house was truly empty. Turning the key, the rabbits below could hear the lock click. Inside, Mr. Tod was furious to find his belongings set out for Tommy Brock. He crept in and out of the house, eventually entering the bedroom where Tommy Brock lay sleeping. Mr. Tod, uneasy, opened the window, preparing a plan involving a clothesline and a pail of water to disturb Tommy Brock. Despite his efforts, Tommy Brock remained undisturbed, even as Mr. Tod struggled with the water.

Tommy Brock quickly left the room after rolling up Mr. Tod's dressing-gown and placing it under a pail of water in the bed. Meanwhile, Mr. Tod struggled to untie a tight knot that had formed due to the weight and strain on the tree. After gnawing at it for more than twenty minutes, the rope suddenly gave way, almost pulling out Mr. Tod's teeth. In the kitchen, Tommy Brock, dry and grinning, poured scalding tea over Mr. Tod, leading to a fierce battle between them. Below, the rabbits heard the chaos unfold. Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had a sleepless night and quarreled over breakfast. Old Mr. Bouncer, sulky and barricaded in a corner, wondered about Flopsy's next move after she had finished spring-cleaning. Benjamin Bunny, in the midst of the wreckage, found something warm and alive in the oven, which turned out to be the young rabbit family. Peter and Benjamin hurriedly carried the young ones home, much to the relief and joy of Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer.|"[""1.
