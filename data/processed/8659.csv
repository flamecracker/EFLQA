"When the Pilgrim Fathers arrived in Plymouth, they quickly designated a meeting place for their Separatist church, a sturdy and elegant timber fort where they gathered every Lord's Day until they constructed a meeting-house in 1648. Each new settlement that followed suit built a meeting-house for public worship. The Puritans distinguished between the church and the meeting-house, reserving the term ""church"" for the worshippers and calling the meeting-house the Lord's Day house. These meeting-houses symbolized the establishment of the theocracy the settlers sought to create in New England. By 1675, a law mandated the prompt construction of a meeting-house in every town, with magistrates authorized to build it at the town's expense if the residents delayed. Each church operated independently, with the power to manage its members and church affairs according to the guidelines of the Platform of Church Discipline."|"['1.

"The early meeting-houses were simple structures, typically square log-houses with clay-filled chinks and thatched roofs. Initially, settlers took pride in adding lathing and whitewashing inside. These humble buildings, like the first one in Dedham measuring 36 feet long, were later converted into granaries or storehouses. As the colonists prospered, they built more elaborate sanctuaries, known as ""good roomthy meeting-houses."" The second style featured square wooden buildings with belfries if affordable, like the Old Ship in Hingham. These structures, replicated across New England, led to more sophisticated church architecture styles. Meeting-houses were often located on hilltops for defense against Indians, as landmarks, and for their aesthetic appeal. Despite their once prominent role, many of these churches now lie abandoned, with neglected graveyards serving as melancholic reminders of a bygone era. The colonial spellings in descriptions of these early meeting-houses showcase the varied and inventive language of the time."|['1.

The church-raising was a significant event in the town. By law, every citizen had to participate or contribute to the construction of the meeting house. Nails were so scarce that some unscrupulous individuals would burn down empty buildings to salvage the nails. Each male resident had to provide a specific number of nails for the new church. Besides logs, lumber, and labor, a contribution was collected for a barrel of rum and other items. Accidents were common during these events, with men falling from scaffolding and getting injured. In some instances, like in Northampton in 1738, rum was bought to raise the meeting house, leading to injuries. Initially, meeting houses had oiled paper windows for light, but later glass panes were used. These early churches lacked shade due to the fear of forest fires, making them uncomfortably hot in summer and cold in winter.|['1.

In the early days, the meeting-houses were adorned with strange decorations, such as wolves' heads nailed under windows and by doors, with blood stains below. The settlers feared wolves more than bears due to their destructive nature. Bears were abundant, with records showing the killing of twenty bears near Boston in just one week in 1725. Rewards were offered for wolf killings, with instructions to nail the wolf's head to the meeting-house. The meeting-houses served various purposes, including storing gunpowder until after the Revolutionary War. Punishment instruments like stocks and pillories were present, and the first man to occupy Boston's stocks was the carpenter who built them. The meeting-houses also stored grain and sometimes served as a place to dry tobacco leaves.|"[""1.

In colonial New England, the meeting-houses in rural areas were left unpainted at first due to beliefs against vanity. However, as paint became more affordable in the mid-18th century, a competition arose to decorate churches. Towns would levy taxes and seek donations to buy paint. For instance, Pomfret's bright yellow meeting-house sparked envy, leading neighboring towns like Windham and Killingly to mimic its colors. Brooklyn's church went all out, painting its exterior bright orange with chocolate-colored doors and white trim. Inside, simplicity reigned with wooden rafters, sand floors, and benches. A peculiar feature was the sounding-board above the pulpit, ornately decorated but serving little purpose beyond reflecting sound. Children found amusement in studying the knots and veins in the unpainted wood of pews and galleries, while dusty spider webs and cobwebs provided distractions during lengthy sermons. Additionally, Puritans used to carry guns to church for protection against Indians and wolves, a practice that continued for many years.|"['1.

The New Haven church in Colonial times took great care to ensure safety on the Sabbath. They made bullets common currency to ensure everyone had them, instructed colonists on what to do in case of attack, and required men to bring powder and shot to meetings. The church resembled a garrison, with soldiers seated at the main door, cannons mounted nearby, and armed watchers patrolling the streets. However, not all soldiers behaved with decorum, as disorderly incidents were reported. Despite these events, the union of church and army was accepted, with military exercises starting and ending with prayer and psalm-singing. In other settlements like Concord and York, armed men attended church services due to the constant threat of Indian attacks. The men always left the church first to ensure the safety of women and children. The assembly for the Sabbath service was signaled by sounds like Abraham Tyler's horn or the blowing of a conch-shell.|"['1.

In the early days of East Hadley, the person who played the conch shell and cleaned the meeting-house received a yearly payment of three dollars. Drumming, on the other hand, was considered a more skilled task and drummers were paid more. The drum was often used to gather people for worship, and in some towns, it was the primary way to notify the community. The use of drums for church gatherings continued until the introduction of bells. In some cases, flags were also used to signal the time for religious services. The ringing of bells in Boston on Sundays is believed to have been done using hand-bells initially. The church bells, sometimes hung on trees, caused distress to the native Indians. The townspeople would assemble in an orderly manner upon hearing the drum or bell, with families walking together to the church, led by the minister and his wife.|['1.

In some churches, congregants would sit in their pews upon arrival, rising when the parson, clad in a black skull-cap and Geneva cloak, entered. They stood as a sign of respect until he took his place in the pulpit. In 18th-century New England churches, it was customary for the whole congregation to remain standing after the service until the minister descended from the pulpit, escorted his wife from her pew, and greeted others as they left. Early meeting-house benches were long, narrow, and uncomfortable, with no back support. Wealthier families eventually had their own family pews, each uniquely designed. A boy once caused a commotion by attempting to walk on the narrow ledge of a pew's foot-bench, resulting in a noisy crash and a scolding from the minister.|"[""1.

In olden times, church pews had seats that could be lifted against the walls, creating a loud noise heard from far away. Mischievous boys would slam the seats as a greeting, causing a commotion. The pews had balustrades that children would fiddle with, creating squeaks and distractions during long sermons. Restless children received herbs like caraway to stay quiet. One girl even ate the herbs, causing a stir. The fragrance of southernwood was a common scent in churches, symbolizing Sabbath peace. Cushions were rare, and only the wealthy had cushioned pews. Even the pulpit seats were without cushions, except for ones kept for the Bible. Old church traditions and practices were unique to New England, creating a nostalgic atmosphere for those who remember them.|['1.

"In early New England churches, seating arrangements were a serious affair. Wealth and status determined where individuals sat during worship. Committees were formed to assign seats based on rank and importance. The committee members changed frequently to avoid any favoritism. Lists of assigned seats were read aloud and posted on the church door, making it a law. Disobeying the assigned seating led to fines or reprimands. Men and women sat separately, entering through different doors. The most prestigious seat was the ""foreseat"" in front of the pulpit. Some churches had private family pews, and deacons and elders had designated seating areas. The congregation was divided into sections, with men on one side and women on the other. Prominent individuals had reserved seats, ensuring order and hierarchy during church services."|"['1.

In early New England churches, seating arrangements caused much strife and contention. The minister's family had a special square pew, but with large families, there were constant debates over enlarging or rearranging seating. The gallery seats were considered the most prestigious, leading to jealousy and disputes. The process of assigning seats caused disappointment, jealousy, and quarrels in the community. To restore peace, some churches equalized the dignity of seats. Wives had to have seats of equal importance to their husbands, and widows retained their husband's seat dignity. The process of dignifying seats lasted for years and was not abandoned until the early 19th century in some churches. Some towns had detailed rules for seating based on age, office, military service, and financial contributions. In some cases, pews were even sold to the highest bidder to resolve disputes.|"['1.

In the olden days, honor and respect in the community were displayed through seating arrangements in meetings. Judge Sewall, proud when his wife was seated in the foreseat, later regretted his pride when she passed away. Often, there was a lack of seating in the meeting-houses, leading to complaints of people squeezed on stairs. Some brought chairs into the aisles, causing nuisances. In some towns, laws were passed to remove these extra seats. Young men and women sat separately, with select groups being allowed to build pews. There were instances of objections and protests, like when bachelors in Newbury broke a pew built by young women, leading to fines and punishments. The restrictions placed on single men in the colonies may have fueled their objections to young women owning pews.|"[""1.

"Infants were carried to church by their mothers, who sometimes sat outside listening to the sermon while tending to their babies. In the old meeting-houses, there were small cages for very young children who couldn't sit alone. Girls sat with their families, while boys were kept separate and watched closely by constables or tithingmen. The boys misbehaved, poking each other and causing mischief, leading to fines for laughing or playing during service. Even girls like Tabatha Morgus were fined for laughing. The boys, known as ""sons of Belial,"" would also whittle the woodwork in the meeting-house, prompting towns like Medford to pass orders against damaging the benches.

"The Norwalk community is remembered for their lenient approach to discipline. The tithingman was only allowed a small stick and instructed to use it with kindness. However, misbehaving boys faced public punishment. In contrast, Hartford boys endured harsh treatment by the church, being publicly disciplined during worship. Parson Chauncey of Durham took a different approach, addressing misbehaving boys privately to teach them valuable lessons. While some tithingmen were cruel, one devised a humiliating punishment by seating boys with their mothers. Boys misbehaving during meetings were moved to sit with younger children. Boys causing trouble in church galleries were referred to as ""the Devil's play-houses."" Despite these strict measures, mischievous boys found ways to cause trouble, even damaging church property.

"In the old Puritan meeting houses, seating arrangements were highly structured. Boys were sometimes seated with negroes, but in most towns, negroes had separate seats labeled ""B.W."" for black women and ""B.M."" for black men. A humorous incident occurred when a man unknowingly sat in the black men's pew after a jest from William Mills. A unique seat was the ""Deaf Pew"" for hard of hearing, and a dreaded ""stool of repentance"" was used for public shaming. The choir often sat in galleries, facing the congregation, creating a powerful singing presence. The tithingman, a comical figure with a wand, ensured order by waking sleepers with a foxtail. This historical custom of designated seating reflected social status and respect in the church community."|"['1.

During Puritan times in the 17th century, church-goers were expected to stay awake during long, droning sermons. Tithingmen were appointed to ensure everyone stayed alert. If caught napping, they faced harsh consequences. The story of Roger Scott from Lynn, who was whipped for striking a tithingman who woke him suddenly, illustrates the severity of the rules. Another incident involved Allen Bridges, who used a staff with a fox tail and a thorn to keep sleepers awake. One man, Mr. Tomlins, startled awake, thought a wood-chuck had bitten him, causing a commotion in the church. These tales of church-awakenings paint a vivid picture of the strict and sometimes comical methods used to prevent sleeping during sermons, showing the importance placed on attentiveness in religious gatherings.|['1.

The President, after missing his way on a trip through Connecticut, had to ride on a Sunday morning to make it to town for church. Along the way, he was stopped by a Tything man who questioned his reasons for traveling. Only after explaining his situation and promising not to go further than the town intended, was the President allowed to continue his journey. This incident highlights the role of the ancient tithingman, who enforced various laws and rules, including those related to Sabbath activities. In colonial times, time was marked by sundials and hour-glasses, with a tithingman turning the hour-glass during religious services as a reminder of time passing. Sermons could be very long, lasting several hours, and some clergy members resisted changes like introducing Sunday schools. Despite efforts to prolong sermons, changes eventually took place, showing that traditions evolve over time.|"['1.

In the early days of New England, lengthy prayers were highly valued, with some lasting up to two hours. The Puritans, who left the Church of England to avoid brief prayers, considered long prayers a sign of devotion. Standing during prayers was common, and ministers paused to allow the weary to sit. Despite discomfort and long services, complaints were rare. The congregation stood during prayers until recent times, honoring tradition and faith. Ministers were trained in prayer on various occasions, enabling them to face challenges. A story of a minister out-praying an Indian medicine-man illustrates the power of prayer. Over time, as people became less patient, services were shortened. In the past, attendees were not allowed to leave until the service ended. Eventually, as other forms of entertainment emerged, church services were shortened, providing relief to both ministers and congregants.|['1.

Judge Sewall described an extreme cold storm in his diary. He noted how the bread froze at the Lord's Table and how even the ink froze while he tried to write by the fire. Despite the freezing conditions, he found comfort at the meeting. In colonial times, rooms were so cold that even sitting by a fireplace didn't provide enough warmth. This is why his ink froze while he wrote. Sewall also mentioned a day with extreme cold when a newborn baby was baptized in a freezing church. Children were always brought to the meeting-house for baptism, even in bitter weather. Sewall's diary entries about baptizing his children show his pride and hopes for their future. The minister once prayed for milder weather, and the next day, a thaw began, seen as a direct answer to the prayer. Some clergy were annoyed by the noise of the congregation trying to keep warm during long winter sermons. One clergyman even rebuked his freezing congregation with powerful words from the Bible to make them quiet.|"[""1.

In the olden days, ministers endured the freezing cold during services. They preached and prayed with mittens or gloves, donning long cloaks and skull caps to keep warm. Dr. Stevens of Kittery would check the church attendance on icy days. If only seven were present, he'd invite them to his warm home for the sermon. However, with eight, he'd brave the snow in his cloak, fur cap, and mittens to preach. The harsh winter conditions in the unheated churches were so severe that it's speculated whether illnesses like consumption originated from these icy settings. While men had adequate clothing, women's attire was scanty, with thin gowns and little protection from the cold. Women wore gloves, mittens, and enormous fur muffs to shield hands, along with various hoods and veils to cover their heads.|['1.

During harsh winter days, women used foot-stoves to keep warm in the cold meeting-houses. These metal boxes filled with hot coals from home or neighboring farms helped the women endure the icy chill. Children would huddle around their mothers' foot-stoves, warming their frozen fingers. Some foot-stoves were extravagant church decorations, like one made of brass with the owner's initials and a fancy chain. In some places, foot-stoves were banned to avoid fire hazards. In other instances, worshippers used fur bags or even brought dogs to provide warmth. Churches imposed fines for bringing dogs inside, showing the strict rules to keep the cold out. Over time, churches started using stoves for heating during services, but some congregations resisted, preferring the chill over modern comforts.|"['1.

In the past, churches were not built with the idea of having comfortable furniture, so they had to make do with large stoves in the central aisle. These stoves were not only unsightly but also caused issues like smoke, soot, and even dripping liquids during church services. Many people objected to the stoves for various reasons, including concerns about fires, headaches, and even the heat damaging the ladies' hair combs. Despite the objections, some believed that physical comfort was essential for spiritual well-being. An amusing incident was shared about a woman who fainted due to the heat of the stove, only to find out later that it wasn't even lit.

"With all this supporting proof, I believe it is clear that the incident truly occurred in Litchfield and that the credit was wrongly attributed to other towns by dishonest chroniclers; otherwise, we would have to accept a remarkable agreement of church pranks and fake fainting spells across New England. The Puritan nature, stern and averse to pleasure yet glorying in trials, led our ancestors to forsake their English homes and come to these harsh, desolate shores for the love of God and freedom of conscience. They endured personal discomforts with fortitude and even satisfaction, clinging steadfastly to symbols of austere simplicity. The lack of warmth during worship was a testament to their dedication to a religion they believed thrived on Spartan severity. In early colonial days, a ""noon-house"" was often seen beside old meeting-houses, offering warmth and sustenance to congregants between services.

"In the past, churches did not have horse-sheds until after the War of the Revolution. These sheds were built to protect horses and carriages from the weather. In Longmeadow Church in 1796, a horse house was erected in the Meeting House Lane. Boys were not allowed to talk or play in these sheds. In some churches, the Bible was read to keep the boys quiet during the nooning. The boys were sometimes asked to explain sermon notes they had taken. Sabbath-schools were established later, gaining children's interest during the noon interval. The ""wretched boys"" of the Puritan Sabbath disappeared when families sat together in their own pews. The fashion of sermon-reading during the nooning was not common in all parts of New England. In many villages, the nooning was a time for townspeople to discuss news, events, and even horse-trading. Women gathered around the fire, exchanging recipes and quilt-patterns, giving medical advice, and sometimes taking snuff together."|"[""1.

In early New England, wood for noon-house fires came from farmers in the congregation, each contributing a load. Wealthy landowners often provided cider for warmth, with a barrel worth as much as the wood. Cider prices varied, from six shillings in 1782 to ten shillings in 1679. The cider was a source of refreshment and warmth for farmers and church members. Some farmers built private noon-houses with cooking utensils for meals and drinks like hot toddies or flip made with beer, sugar, and rum. Deacons played a crucial role in church duties, including caring for the poor and providing sacramental wines. They were respected figures who sat near the pulpit and wore white linen caps in some areas. Taxes were levied to fund the sacraments, sometimes in the form of wheat or corn. Despite some abuses, deacons were vital to church life in early New England.|['1.

"During the early days of New England, church deacons were responsible for caring for the vessels used in communion services. These vessels were sometimes stored under the pulpit in a closet near the ""Ministers wives pue."" Legend has it that this closet was also used to discipline unruly boys. The communion vessels varied in material, from wooden chalices to pewter and silver pieces donated by church members. The Hanover church still treasures its pewter communion service. Contributions were an important part of church services, with members offering money, goods, or even libellous verses. Even broken wampum was sometimes given, leading to rules about only accepting silver or bills. During the Revolutionary times, special contributions were collected for the Continental Army, including valuable items like jewelry and clothing. One notable act of patriotism was when Madam Faith Trumbull donated her scarlet cloak to be used as trimmings for soldiers' uniforms."|"['1.

In the past, some New England churches had a unique custom where deacons had a significant duty. In Pelham, Massachusetts, during the late 18th century under Rev. Stephen Burroughs, church members received metal checks each month. These checks allowed them to participate in communion, and without one, they were temporarily excommunicated. Deacons distributed these checks to the deserving members, ensuring they were presented during communion. The absence of a check caused great embarrassment. Similar practices were observed in Londonderry, New Hampshire, where special tokens were required for communion. These tokens were presented to pious members by deacons and elders. The communities gathered for solemn services, followed by joyous celebrations and social gatherings. The use of tokens in these churches continued until the early 19th century. Today, some of these tokens are preserved in historical collections.|"['1.

"The deacons in different parishes had various tasks to complete. Some duties were shared with the tithingman. They visited church members' homes to hear children recite the catechism, prayed with the sick, and reported minor offenses. Although they didn't hold as much legal power as tithingmen and constables, there was a desire among early ministers for deaconesses in the New England Puritan church. Deaconesses were seen as more suitable for visiting the sick and afflicted. An aged deaconess in Holland had kept order in meetings and spoke with her ""guifts."" The old psalm book of Ainsworth, printed in Amsterdam in 1612, was cherished by the Pilgrims, adding a historical and charming touch to their worship. The book featured diverse typefaces, including Roman, Italics, and black-letter, making it visually appealing but challenging to read due to the mix of fonts."|['1.

"Henry Ainsworth, a notable figure among Puritans, was a scholar and peacemaker. He was known for his work in translating and commenting on religious texts. Ainsworth's writing style included unique compound phrases formed with hyphens, such as ""highly-him-preferre"" and ""repose-me-quietlie."" Despite his scholarly contributions, Ainsworth faced challenges within his community, including disputes over church practices and even the dress of a parson's wife. Ainsworth's death in 1623 was surrounded by mystery, with some accounts suggesting he was poisoned after a confrontation with a Jew over a valuable diamond.

"The Puritans loved singing psalms, influenced by Geneva and Wittenberg. The Pilgrim Fathers, like Brewster and Bradford, brought psalm copies to the New World. Ainsworth, a pastor, was better at explaining than poetry. His version of the Nineteenth Psalm was well-known. The annotations in his book were like an encyclopedia, explaining spiritual and temporal matters. The Pilgrims learned about lions and anger from the annotations. Ainsworth's explanations were detailed, like defining ""make-a-mow"" as making a face.

"Before the Holland exiles had this Ainsworth's version to sing from, they used the book ""Sternhold and Hopkins' Psalms."" They gladly abandoned it to honor their pastor's work. They may have also been pleased not to sing verses authorized by the Church of England. However, singing Sternhold's lines like ""Alas, poor Priscilla!"" was challenging. The tune in the psalm-book didn't match the meter well. When singing from the pages, it might have been turned into a chant to fit the irregular lines. The Ainsworth's Version was used in early New England meetings. Elder Brewster owned a copy, as shown in his library inventory. Not every family had one due to poverty or illiteracy. Deaconing or lining the psalm, where each line was read then sung, was common. Eventually, New England's psalm-book replaced Ainsworth's in churches."|"['1.

The second version of Ainsworth's book came out in 1617, a third in 1618, and a fourth in London in 1639 as a folio. The sixth version, printed in Amsterdam in 1644, was an octavo. There is a small 24mo copy in the Essex Institute in Salem, and an octavo in the Prince Library in Boston. Reverend Thomas Prince noted in the latter copy that the 1618 version was sung in Plymouth Colony and New England until the New England Version was printed. The first edition of Ainsworth is in the Bodleian Library and Trinity College Library, Dublin. The American Antiquarian Society and the Lenox Library in America have copies. The American Antiquarian Society's copy was given by Reverend William Bentley in 1815. The Bay Psalm Book, now in Worcester Library, was also owned by Bentley. Bentley was a divine, bibliophile, and antiquary, with a strong sense of loyalty during the War of 1812.|"[""Question 1:\nWhere was the fourth version of Ainsworth's book published?\nA) London\nB) Amsterdam\nC) Salem\nD) Boston\nE) Dublin"", ""Question 2:\nWhich library holds the first edition of Ainsworth's book?\nA) Bodleian Library\nB) Essex Institute\nC) Prince Library\nD) Trinity College Library\nE) Lenox Library"", ""Question 3:\nWho noted that the 1618 version of Ainsworth's book was sung in Plymouth Colony and New England?\nA) Reverend William Bentley\nB) Reverend Thomas Prince\nC) American Antiquarian Society\nD) Essex Institute\nE) Lenox Library"", ""Question 4:\nWhen was the small 24mo copy of Ainsworth's book found in the Essex Institute?\nA) 1617\nB) 1618\nC) 1639\nD) 1644\nE) 1815"", ""Question 5:\nWho gave a copy of Ainsworth's book to the American Antiquarian Society in 1815?\nA) Reverend William Bentley\nB) Reverend Thomas Prince\nC) Trinity College Library\nD) Lenox Library\nE) Essex Institute"", ""Question 6:\nWhat was Reverend William Bentley's profession?\nA) Printer\nB) Soldier\nC) Divine\nD) Sailor\nE) Politician""]"|['A) London', 'A) Bodleian Library', 'B) Reverend Thomas Prince', 'Not explicitly mentioned in the text.', 'A) Reverend William Bentley', 'C) Divine']
Around 1639, New Englanders felt the need to restore the singing of Psalms in their churches. They were grateful for the translated Psalms but found many discrepancies from the original text. Thus, a new translation began, with prominent divines like Mr. Welds, Mr. Eliot, and Mr. Mather taking part. The Psalms were printed in 1640 at Cambridge. Mr. Dunster later refined the translation with the help of Mr. Lyon. Despite criticisms of the poetry, the translators prioritized faithfulness over elegance. The Psalms were revised over time, including the addition of Scripture-Songs. The hymns, though unique, may not have been as melodic as expected. The efforts to improve the Psalms continued, reflecting the evolving nature of religious texts.|"['1.

"Rev. Elias Nason humorously comments on ""The Bay Psalm-Book,"" stating that Welde, Eliot, and Mather took on the challenging task of creating this unique piece of literature. They delved into Hebrew psalms and metrical psalmody, resulting in a version that underwent numerous revisions. By 1709, sixteen editions had been printed, with a total of at least seventy editions published. Interestingly, some English dissenting congregations and Scottish kirks even utilized this New England version over smoother English compositions. Despite its shortcomings in language and printing quality, the binding of these psalm-books was durable and well-crafted. The book was highly valued by early colonists, serving as a source of great comfort and mercy. Eventually, dissatisfaction arose, leading to petitions for newer, smoother versions of psalms by Tate and Brady, and Watts. This transition sparked controversies and church-quarrels, culminating in the abandonment of ""The Bay Psalm-Book"" by the end of the century.

"It is surprising that Thomas was unaware of other copies of the first edition of ""The Bay Psalm-Book."" Six copies were housed in the Prince Library at the Old South Church in Boston.

Two are still at the Public Library of Boston. Lieutenant-Governor Samuel Armstrong gave the other three copies to individuals, including Edward Crowninshield, Nathaniel Shurtleff, and George Livermore.

Sternhold, a Calvinist, and Hopkins, a minister, collaborated on this version. Sternhold's intention was for Englishmen to sing these verses for solace and comfort, replacing ungodly songs.

Hopkins wrote a modest preface for his part of the work, praising Sternhold. He admitted his verses were not as exquisite as Sternhold's but still considered them fruitful. The Psalms saw multiple editions over the years, with various authors contributing. Despite criticism, the Psalms remained popular, with numerous editions published. Sternhold and Hopkins' Psalms even had two editions in shorthand. Criticism and praise for the Psalms were abundant, showing the diverse opinions on the work. Wesley criticized the Psalms, while others appreciated them for their devotion. The Psalms also influenced music, with melodies published alongside the verses. In 1592, an essential collection of psalm tunes was released to accompany Sternhold and Hopkins' words. The music included different note shapes and was named after places, a tradition that continues today.|"[""1.

"Music during that era was referred to as pricked, not printed, a term derived from the dot or prick that formed the note's head. Songs printed in multiple parts were known as prick-songs, distinguishing them from those sung extemporaneously or by ear. The term prick-song was not only found in musical books but also in the literature of that time, including Shakespeare's works. Sternhold's songs were considered prick-songs as they included printed music notes. Many tunes in the collection were sourced from the Genevan Psalter, Luther's Psalm-Book, Marot, and Beza's French Book of Psalms, leading to them being mockingly called ""Genevan Jiggs"" and ""Beza's Ballets."" There were significant differences in the wording of various editions of Sternhold and Hopkins' Psalms, with later editions introducing substantial alterations that were criticized by scholars like Warton.

I admit openly that I always enjoy reading Sternhold and Hopkins' Psalms, even though critics may disapprove. The rough vigor and sweeping swing of the renderings impress me more than modern polished methods. These antique psalms evoke the olden times, with a distinct flavor that sets them apart from contemporary poetry. In New England, old, tattered psalm-books of different versions are found in libraries, attics, or among dusty books. Some settlers brought French Psalm-books to America, like the Marot and Beza's Version used by French Huguenot settlers. Marot, a French poet, created the first metrical psalm translation sung by the people, aiding the Reformation. Despite being under Church condemnation, Marot's psalm-songs gained popularity among nobles and courtiers, even though they were later banned by the Church.|"[""1.

"The serious and forward-thinking Calvin quickly embraced Marot's Psalms, expanded to fifty, and included them in the Genevan Confession of Faith. He recommended that they be sung with the solemn melodies composed by Guillaume Frane. Theodore Beza, a prominent theologian, aided in completing the collection, which saw high demand with ten thousand copies sold immediately, an impressive figure for that era. Marot, however, did not find contentment in Geneva with Calvin and the Calvinists. Beza mentioned in his ""History of the French Reformed Churches"" that Marot, unable to conform to the Gospel reformation, lived out his final days in Piedmont under the king's protection. Despite various editions, the French Psalm-Book's appearance evolved from lavish to simpler bindings over time due to changing perceptions. While Marot's psalms feature diverse song-measures, some are elegant and melodious, retaining their charm with old-fashioned spelling.

"The first printed edition of the Psalms in 1696 was titled ""The Book of Psalms, a new version in metre fitted to church tunes by N. Tate and N. Brady.""

Another version found in New England is ""Patrick's Version"" by John Patrick, D.D. It includes explanations of less common words for the common people's benefit.

"I have read these lines over and over again and fail to see anything very funny in them, though they might be slightly changed for the better. Still, they may seem very silly and laughable from an English perspective. Cotton Mather's version was so much better than the poor verses in ""The Bay Psalm-Book"" that one wonders why it wasn't eagerly accepted by the New England churches. They probably preferred rhyming, even the terrible rhymes in ""The Bay Psalm Book."" The ""Psalterium Americanum"" didn't have musical notes or directions, which also made it less likely to be used. Other American clergymen made metrical versions of the psalms that were loved by their congregations. Rev. John Barnard published a psalm-book for his people in Marblehead, but it was never used elsewhere. Rev. Abijah Davis copied pages from Watts without giving credit in his book of psalms. Watts's Hymns, not widely used until after the Revolution, are still well-known. Many new psalm books have been published in the last century, filling church libraries, pews, and second-hand bookshops. Music during worship in early New England was dismal, not only because of the confusing psalms but also due to the few known tunes and how they were sung.

Judge Sewall, a Puritan in early America, faced a challenge with the singing of psalms in his community. Despite the lack of musical training, singers chose their tunes freely, leading to chaos in the choirs. Sewall struggled with singers switching tunes mid-song, showcasing a lack of unity and discipline. The community's reverence for psalm-singing was immense, with even distant tunes prompting acts of respect. The power of psalm-singing in binding the colonists together was profound, fostering a sense of unity and love.

"In colonial New England, church singing sparked heated debates and controversies. Some clergy demanded better performances, while others opposed singing altogether. Traditionalists clung to old ways, resisting the new method of singing by note. They argued that singing by note was blasphemous, popish, and a ploy for money. The dispute over ""singing by rule"" or ""singing by rote"" led to intense animosity among the colonists. Prominent clergymen wrote essays on the topic, and singing lectures were held. A ""Pacificatory Letter"" was needed to calm tensions. Eventually, the traditionalists were convinced that the oldest way was singing by note.

"The musical battle continued even after singers were taught by rule and formed a choir. The custom of ""lining"" the psalm, where singers paused between each line for a reading, hindered church-singing quality. Suggestions like alternating reading and singing were debated in the 1600s. Dr. Watts complained in 1741, but change was slow. Gradually, singers defied the deacon's lining until it was abolished. In Rowley, the choir sang without reading in 1785, winning against lining. Dissatisfaction in Wilbraham led to changes in 1770. Worcester resolved to sing without lining in 1779, leading to a heartfelt departure by a deacon. Despite victories in bigger towns, smaller parishes continued lining due to lack of hymn-books. This practice, though reduced, still exists in some remote areas in the United States."|"['1.

"During the Revolutionary War, new psalm-books emerged, and churches sought permission to use more melodious hymn books. Books of instruction were abundant, some with notes off the staff or only letters, known as ""dunce notes."" One challenging book was ""The Compleat Melody or Harmony of Sion"" by William Tansur, filled with perplexing musical terms. A clash between treble and tenor parts arose, with trebles eventually leading. The introduction of ""triple-time"" tunes faced opposition from Puritans.

Public worshipers a century ago had mixed feelings about fuguing. While some found it angelic and ecstatic, others deemed it heartless and tasteless. The tunes were criticized as trivial and irreverent by some, who believed they inflated the singers' egos rather than glorifying God. Fuguing tunes caused such a commotion that older churchgoers left mid-service. Some clergy preached against it, citing biblical passages to condemn the introduction of fuguing. Choirs used pitch-pipes to start on the same key, a practice that eventually led to the use of musical instruments, much to the dismay of Puritans who saw it as idolatrous. The use of pitch-pipes was often comical, with some disguised as Bible covers. Despite resistance, musical instruments gradually made their way into church services, sparking both amusement and outrage among congregants.|"['1.

"In the early 18th century, the introduction of musical instruments like organs and violins into New England churches sparked controversy. The Brattle Street Church in Boston initially rejected an English organ gift, which was then sent to King's Chapel. Violins were frowned upon due to their association with tavern music, leading to comical compromises like playing them ""wrong end up."" The use of bass-viols and bassoons also stirred dissent among church members. Some clergy openly expressed disdain for the introduction of these instruments, with one even mockingly announcing the singing of a psalm as ""fiddling.""

"The old hymns had smooth, lively words, but young singers and music teachers wanted new, less serious tunes. They used dance tunes like ""Sweet Anne Page"" and ""Babbling Echo"" with sacred lyrics. Even the jolly tune ""Begone dull care"" was changed to sacred songs. This led to paid quartets and debates over church music improvements. An old clergyman once left a church service in protest against operatic sacred songs, showing disapproval of modern music in churches. Puritans faced disruptions during religious gatherings, with punishments like standing on blocks for interrupting preachers.

During colonial times, not only Quakers but other individuals also spoke out in meetings. In Salem and other towns, those accused of witchcraft would pretend to be afflicted during church services, disrupting the ministers. Ann Putnam, a bold accuser in the Salem Witchcraft trials, once claimed there was a yellow bird on the minister's hat. Despite such interruptions, the services went on. In some communities, like Killingly in 1785, newlyweds would stand during sermons to display their wedding attire, a custom that brought joy to the congregation. On Sabbath and Lecture days, some confessed their sins publicly, seeking forgiveness. Captain John Underhill, a soldier, repented publicly, though his sincerity was doubted. Despite his theatrical repentance, he faced rejection and found solace elsewhere. These public confessions were a common yet distressing practice in the religious colonies.|"[""1.

The tale of his wrongdoings, as recounted by his peers, does not portray him as innocently gazing across the meeting-house. Instead, the narrative is just as entertaining as his own sorrowful and aggrieved description of his trial. His preserved letters reveal a mixture of bluster and sanctimoniousness, with a phonetically spelled tone. One of his letters, penned during his excommunication and banishment, addressed Governor Winthrop. The letter is a blend of reproach and plea for understanding, showcasing his unique spelling and dramatic expressions.

In early colonial times, church-goers faced fines for bringing their dogs to the meeting-house. Dogs imported from England and Ireland caused chaos, even chasing offensive animals into the church. Dog-whippers and tithingmen had to remove them with force. Alarms of fire often disrupted services due to flammable chimneys. Sometimes armed men interrupted services seeking help for wars. Despite these interruptions, most services were relatively quiet, with only sounds like infants crying or swallows chirping. False laws about Sabbath observance were enforced, with fines for activities like fishing or sitting under an apple tree on Sundays. These strict laws aimed to maintain decorum and respect for the Sabbath, even punishing trivial tasks like hanging out clothes or driving cattle on Sundays.|['1.

The Puritans were strict in their observance of the Sabbath, extending it to include Saturday evening as well. They would cease all labor every Saturday at three in the afternoon, spending the rest of the day in religious activities like catechizing and preparation for the Sabbath. Cotton Mather described how his grandfather, John Cotton, began the Sabbath on Saturday evening with long religious services at home. The New England clergymen observed Sunday rigorously, refraining from certain activities from sunset on Saturday until Sunday night. Visitors and travellers were also expected to adhere to these strict laws. Despite the seriousness with which the Puritans observed Saturday night, there was some satire directed towards this practice by authors both in England and America.|"['1.

In the 18th century, strict rules were enforced on the people, dictating their daily activities. Men and women were allowed five and a half days for work and leisure, but beyond that, fines were imposed for being out without reason. A day and a half were designated for rest and reflection, prohibiting travel or socializing. The Puritans held their Sabbath in high regard, transitioning from a day of religious observance to a time of quiet reflection. Any criticism of the church or its ministers was met with severe punishment, such as public whippings or fines. Singing schools were held on Sunday nights, providing a more orderly way to end the day. The Puritans strictly adhered to the Sabbath, showing unwavering devotion to their beliefs. Disobedience was met with harsh consequences, ensuring absolute obedience to the church's teachings.|"['1.

During the Puritan era in New England, strict rules governed behavior. Those who spoke disrespectfully of the church or used profanity faced severe punishments. Profanity, even in jest, led to fines, imprisonment, public shaming, and even physical abuse. Women were also held accountable for their words and actions. Offenses like lying, slander, and disrespect towards ministers were met with fines and exclusion from church sacraments. Excommunication was a severe punishment, isolating individuals from their community and even their own families. In some cases, the excommunicated were not allowed to attend church services and faced social ostracism. However, Rhode Island offered a contrasting view, providing refuge and religious tolerance to those rejected by the stricter Puritan communities.|['1.

During the early days of Puritan ministers, they held significant influence in various aspects except for performing marriage ceremonies or leading prayers at funerals. Sewall expressed jealousy when the English burial service was introduced, criticizing it as not distinguishing between the precious and the vile. Marriage ceremonies were instead conducted by magistrates, following the practice of the Low Countries. Over time, ministers lost some of their authority, and church members openly criticized them for trivial matters. For instance, one minister was condemned for making money by selling farm produce, while another was chastised for playing bowls. Despite the reverence for the church, ministers were no longer viewed as infallible, and dissent towards them became more common, leading to public displays of disapproval like pulling a minister out of the pulpit. The ordination of a minister was a significant event celebrated with a gathering that included an ordination ball and feast with plenty of New England food and drinks like cider, punch, and even beer.|['1.

"Reading an old ""ordination-bill"" from a tavern-keeper, one gets a glimpse into the customs of the past. The bill from an ordination in Hartford in 1784 reveals the expenses incurred: keeping ministers, mugs of tody, cigars, wine, lodgings, bitters, breakfasts, punch bowls, dinners, wine bottles, flip mugs, and more. These bills often include barrels of rum, cider, and mead, along with bowls of punch and toddy. In Massachusetts in 1759, concerns about disorderly conduct during ordination services led to ministers advising against excesses. The excessive feasting and revelry at ordinations were criticized in newspapers, with one instance in 1761 at the Old South Church in Boston causing public controversy due to the lavish feast. Despite the criticism, the cost of the feast, which included a variety of dishes and drinks, seemed reasonable for the occasion."|['1.

Although there is no evidence to confirm that the poor benefitted from the remnants of the Boston feast, records from other towns reveal that any leftovers from the ordination-dinner were put to good use. Sometimes, they were used to provide food for the new minister's table. In one instance, the excess provisions were sold in Killingly to help settle the outgoing minister's salary arrears, demonstrating a commendable effort to balance the accounts. The dedication of a church during an ordination would naturally be a cause for additional celebration. An intriguing account of the feast at the dedication of the Old Tunnel Meeting-House in Lynn in 1682 describes a vibrant scene. The dedication dinner took place in Mr. Hoode's large barn, which was adorned with green bows and other decorations. The space was transformed into a banquet hall, where a variety of delicious foods were served, including bear-stake, deer-meat, rabbit, fowl, puddings, pies, tarts, fruits, cider, and Barbadoes drink. The ministers were solemn and focused on discussing the dedication sermon, while the younger members of the Council aimed to have a more festive time. Despite some mishaps and humorous incidents during the feast, it was a joyous occasion that brought together the community in celebration of the new meeting house.|"[""1.

During the seventeenth century, the ordination of ministers was a significant event, often marked by disorder and opposition from the congregation. The Puritan ministers, once revered, now faced challenges and disruptions during their appointments. At the New North Church in Boston in 1720, the ordination of Rev. Peter Thatcher was marred by unruly behavior from opposing factions within the congregation. These disruptions, fueled by strong punch and rum, highlighted a shift in attitudes towards church leadership. The once absolute reverence for ministers gave way to irreverence and personal agendas, reflecting changing times and societal values. Amidst these challenges, the need for temperance reform became increasingly apparent, signaling a shift in the church's standing and the ministers' roles within the community.|"['1.

"In early New England, most ministers were hardworking and diligent, unlike the lazy pastors Shakespeare described. They did not walk a path of idleness but were industrious, preaching and praying multiple times a week, visiting the sick, offering medical advice, and even teaching young men for college. They were described with unique and elaborate titles like ""holy-heavenly"" and ""soul-ravishing."" Despite their dedication, many Puritan ministers battled with doubts and fears, facing uncertainty about their faith and salvation. Some, like Rev. Mr. Bradstreet, had unconventional habits, such as preaching from the deacons' pew and wearing a plaid gown with a pipe. Their struggles with despair and gloom were profound, contrasting sharply with the prosperous and cheerful times we live in today."|"['1.

"During the early years, the New England ministers were not always somber. Cheerful gatherings were held during ordination times, where they enjoyed generous amounts of sack and white wine sent by the Court as a mark of respect. The clergymen depicted in paintings were far from gloomy, as indicated by the presence of punch bowls, drinking cups, tobacco, and pipes in their portraits. The motto ""In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, in all things charity"" further reflected their jovial nature. Some ministers were known for their excellent cider, with one minister's cider being so good that an Indian visitor remarked that Adam and Eve should have made apples into cider instead of eating them. Despite their reputation for fine cider, some ministers also ventured into making stronger liquors and even operated distilleries. One pastor, Rev. Nathan Strong, faced bankruptcy due to his distilling venture, but his public image remained intact, and he even joked about his liquor-making endeavors. Impostors posing as ministers also plagued the early New England colonists, with some engaging in fraudulent activities while pretending to be clergymen.

The Puritan divines, like all men, were not immune to human weaknesses. Reverend Samuel Whiting of Lynn once surprised a group of young people by kissing all the girls, claiming it made him feel better. Even the esteemed Cotton Mather had his amorous encounters. Despite being a mourning widower, he found himself charmed by a young Boston woman. Mather's portrait reveals a handsome man who resisted her advances after fasting and praying for three nights. Puritan ministers often faced financial challenges, with salaries ranging from £20 to £100 annually. Some clergymen even received payment in corn, labor, or wampum. Congregations were known to bargain with preachers, requiring contracts for early departure repayments. Despite these financial struggles, ministers' wives were praised for their devotion and support, often being considered the saints of the Puritan community.|"[""1.

During the early days of New Haven, a Puritan community deeply devoted to religion, a paradox arose. The town faced challenges in paying their minister due to issues with the currency and lack of contributions. In 1651, a decree was made to enforce payment to the minister's salary, even resorting to rating those who did not contribute on Sundays. Despite some objections, fines were imposed on dissenters, like Lieutenant Fuller, who criticized the law on ministers' maintenance. The community also took part in building the minister's house and meeting-house, contributing materials and labor. Pasturage for the minister's horse was provided in the village burial-ground, but abuses led to restrictions. Settlements and sums of money were given to ministers upon their ordination, as seen in the case of Mr. Smith in Sharon.|"[""1.

In the eighteenth century, Puritan ministers in New England were strong supporters of the American Revolution, fearing the English kings' intentions to establish Episcopacy in the colonies. After gaining independence, ministers faced financial struggles, often receiving worthless continental paper money as salaries. They resorted to bartering goods instead of accepting depreciated currency. Some ministers petitioned not to increase their salaries due to difficulties in receiving payments. Church members supported their ministers with various gifts like fish, turnips, and even whales. Donation parties and spinning bees were organized to provide ministers with household items and clothing. Despite the challenges, ministers persevered, relying on the generosity and support of their communities to make ends meet.|['1.

In colonial New England, the minister and his family were supported by the congregation in various ways. Women would create patchwork bed quilts for the minister's family, either by contributing individual squares or by collectively quilting the coverlet. Men in the parish would assist the minister with harvesting by providing a day's work, and in return, they were supplied with rum for a celebratory drink. Another common contribution was cord-wood, with each male church member expected to deliver a load to the parsonage. This wood was essential for keeping warm fires in the minister's home, with some ministers receiving up to one hundred and twenty loads annually. The tradition of providing wood for the minister persisted for many years, showcasing the community's support and care for their religious leaders.|"[""1.

In the past, New England preachers had various ways to supplement their income. They often received gloves and rings at weddings, funerals, and christenings, which they sometimes sold. For instance, the Rev. Mr. Elliot sold both gloves and rings. His record shows that in thirty-two years, he received an astonishing two thousand nine hundred and forty pairs of gloves. Despite the challenge of selling dead men's gloves, he managed to make about six hundred and forty dollars from selling them. To save money, many pastors and their families practiced frugal living. They wore homespun and patched clothing, made their candles from bayberries, and even gathered wild berries and mushrooms for food. Some ministers could not afford paper for writing sermons and had to be resourceful in their use of materials. Despite the financial challenges, these families managed to make ends meet through careful budgeting and resourcefulness.|['1.

In the early days of New England, ministers often had to engage in various money-making activities to support themselves and their families. Some were farmers during the week, while others took in young men to educate or prepare for college. One minister even educated over 300 young Puritans in his own home. Some ministers learned legal skills to draw up wills, while others dabbled in medicine, selling drugs and giving advice to their parishioners. There were also ministers who worked as coopers, carpenters, rope-makers, millers, or cobblers. One cobbler clergyman even worked on his shoes all week with his Bible open on his bench, marking sermon ideas with waxed shoe-thread. Despite their diverse occupations, ministers faced criticism for being too worldly or neglecting their duties. However, they found creative ways to balance their work and service to their congregations.|['1.

"During Puritan times, ministers held immense authority and used their sermons to address personal matters. One clergyman cleverly announced a long-awaited birth in the congregation by preaching on ""Unto us a son is born."" Another minister, dealing with a sick servant at home, used the text ""My servant lieth at home sick."" Dr. Mather Byles substituted for a missing minister and preached on ""Put not your trust in princes."" Some ministers openly confronted parishioners through their sermons. One reproved a man hoarding corn needed by the town, using Proverbs xi. 26. Another sternly addressed a parishioner through the text ""Ephraim is joined to his idols, let him alone."" Personalities often clashed, like when a pastor indirectly criticized a judge through a psalm, met with a clever response. Ministers weren't shy about personal prayers either, as seen when Rev. Mr. Moody prayed for a young man's arrogance and for a young lady who didn't want public prayers. Their prayers were sometimes quite specific, like Mr. Miles praying for rain in a particular way. Despite the occasional personal touch, some ministers stuck to familiar sermons, with one preaching the same sermon three Sundays in a row until he saw an effect."|['1.

"During colonial times, Puritan ministers in New England delivered sermons that covered a wide range of topics, from personal matters to worldly issues. Rev. Mr. Daggett from Yale College had a unique system of sermons that took him four years to preach.

"In olden New England, the Puritan minister was not just a preacher but also a teacher, adviser, and friend. Every natural event sparked a sermon, from comets to earthquakes. The minister spoke of Divine wrath and judgment, wars, shipwrecks, and even scandals. On Sundays, churchgoers rode to service on sturdy horses, some with a pillion for a companion. The wealthier rode fine pacing horses, prized for their unique gait. Farmers rode long distances to church, starting at daybreak. To save horse and human endurance, the ""ride and tie"" system was used, where couples alternated riding and walking. At the church, horses were tied to palings and trees, resembling a gypsy camp. Despite the solemnity of the Puritans, historical records show a diversity of elegant dress among the congregation, contrary to the common perception of simplicity."|"['1.
