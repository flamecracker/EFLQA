Granny and Reddy Fox had been hungry for days, trying to find food. They attempted to raid Farmer Brown's henhouse at night but failed. Granny suggested trying in daylight, but Reddy doubted it. Granny insisted they check the Big River where food sometimes washed ashore. Reddy followed reluctantly, thinking Granny was foolish for believing they could catch Quacker the Wild Duck. As they trotted across the snow, Reddy doubted their chances. He thought Granny was losing her mind and imagined Quacker laughing at her. Despite his doubts, they continued towards the river, hoping for a meal.|"['1. What were Granny and Reddy Fox trying to find?\nA) Shelter\nB) Food\nC) Treasure\nD) Friends\nE) Water', ""2.

"Reddy Fox chuckled to himself, careful not to let Granny Fox catch him laughing. Whenever Granny glanced his way, Reddy put on a serious face. He seemed just as determined as Granny to catch Quacker the Duck. Granny Fox, being wise in the ways of the world, had a plan in mind as she led Reddy to the Big River. She couldn't help but chuckle quietly to herself, thinking, ""He thinks I'm old and clueless. He believes he knows it all. It's useless to talk to him when he's this arrogant. He needs to learn through experience."" Conceit is thinking you know everything, which can sometimes lead to being disrespectful.

"Reddy Fox peered through the bushes at Quacker swimming in the fast-flowing Big River. ""We've got no chance of catching him,"" Reddy muttered. Granny Fox insisted Reddy spy on Quacker without being seen. Granny then surprised Reddy by performing silly antics on the beach in full view of Quacker. Reddy thought Granny had lost her mind, rolling around, chasing her tail, and playing with a stick. Reddy was embarrassed by Granny's behavior, fearing his neighbors would see and tease him. He believed Granny had gone crazy from hunger.

Granny Fox rolled over and chased her tail in the snow, silently. Reddy debated whether to intervene or wait for her to regain composure. Meanwhile, Quacker, the Wild Duck, watched from the water, surprised by Granny's odd behavior. Despite being a good diver with no fear of the cold, Quacker's curiosity was piqued. He had faced dangers in the Far North and felt confident in his ability to stay safe. However, watching Granny's strange antics made him curious.

Granny Fox and Reddy set out to the Old Briar-patch in search of food. Despite Peter Rabbit not being outside, they spotted him hopping about within the bushes. Peter greeted them, mentioning the hard times and his empty stomach. Reddy, feeling envious of Peter's food, tried to follow him through the briars but struggled due to his larger size. Eventually, Reddy gave up, unable to keep up with Peter's cleverly crafted paths. Granny Fox then led them to the Green Forest to find Mrs. Grouse, but she had wisely hidden in a spruce-tree. The exhausting hunt in the snow made Granny Fox realize she wasn't as spry as she used to be. The lack of food had weakened them, emphasizing the importance of food for strength.|['1.

Granny and Reddy Fox needed to take a break despite feeling hungry. Reddy was so discouraged that he wished he were dead, but Granny reprimanded him gently, reminding him to rest and look at things differently after a little break. Granny, feeling the aches of old age, decided not to join Reddy in hunting at the Old Pasture. This made Reddy realize the truth about Granny's age and how much she had cared for him.

"""Go back inside and rest, Granny,"" he said kindly. ""I'm going to find something, and you'll get your share."" With that, he headed towards the Old Pasture, not minding the ache in his stomach. We all make foolish wishes now and then. Even Peter Rabbit and clever Granny Fox have done it. So, it's no surprise that Reddy Fox, hungry as he was, made a foolish wish. As he left for the Old Pasture to find food, he bravely ventured into the cold, snowy Green Meadows. The snow was hard, allowing him to run on the crust. He remembered a shelter in the Old Orchard where Bob White lived and decided to check there first. As he entered the orchard, he heard Tommy Tit the Chickadee enjoying suet.

Reddy Fox was hungry and frustrated as he roamed through the Old Orchard and past the Smiling Pool. He watched enviously as Bob White and his family enjoyed the grains scattered by Farmer Brown's boy. Reddy tried to sneak up on them but failed. At the Smiling Pool, he saw Billy Mink catch a fish, making Reddy wish he could dive too. Disheartened, Reddy continued to the Old Pasture, feeling bitter about his hunger and inability to climb, fly, or dive. He overlooked his own strengths—his sharp wits, keen senses, and speed. Lost in self-pity, he missed opportunities, like passing by Old Jed Thumper without noticing. The tale teaches that focusing on what one lacks can blind them to their own strengths and opportunities.|"['Question 1:\nWhat was Reddy Fox feeling as he roamed through the Old Orchard and past the Smiling Pool?\nA) Joyful\nB) Frustrated\nC) Grateful\nD) Content\nE) Relaxed', ""Question 2:\nWho was enjoying the grains scattered by Farmer Brown's boy?\nA) Reddy Fox\nB) Billy Mink\nC) Bob White and his family\nD) Old Jed Thumper\nE) Old Orchard"", 'Question 3:\nWhat did Reddy Fox wish he could do after watching Billy Mink catch a fish at the Smiling Pool?\nA) Climb trees\nB) Dive\nC) Fly\nD) Run fast\nE) Sing', 'Question 4:\nWhat did Reddy Fox overlook about himself as he wandered through the Old Pasture?\nA) His sharp wits\nB) His keen senses\nC) His speed\nD) His inability to climb\nE) His inability to fly', ""Question 5:\nWhat did Reddy Fox miss out on because he was lost in self-pity?\nA) Passing by Old Jed Thumper\nB) Watching Bob White's family\nC) Catching a fish like Billy Mink\nD) Enjoying grains scattered by Farmer Brown's boy\nE) Climbing trees in the Old Orchard"", 'Question 6:\nWhat lesson does the tale of Reddy Fox teach?\nA) Always focus on what you lack\nB) Opportunities are always easy to spot\nC) Strengths and opportunities should be ignored\nD) Frustration leads to success\nE) Focusing on what one lacks can blind them to their own strengths and opportunities']"|['B) Frustrated', 'C) Bob White and his family', 'B) Dive', 'A) His sharp wits', 'A) Passing by Old Jed Thumper', 'E) Focusing on what one lacks can blind them to their own strengths and opportunities']
Reddy Fox was on the trail of Old Jed Thumper, but he arrived at Jed's castle just two jumps too late. Disappointed, Reddy realized he wouldn't catch Jed that day. Determined, he put aside his bitterness and focused on using his senses as nature had intended. Following the Big River, he found a spot where the water wasn't frozen. Sniffing the air, he discovered a dead fish floating in the river. Despite the cold water, Reddy waded in and caught the fish. As he ate, he remembered Granny Fox at home, hungry and unable to hunt. After a struggle, Reddy decided to take the fish to Granny instead. This act of kindness filled him with happiness, knowing he had helped Granny despite his own hunger.|"['1.

Reddy Fox rushed home from the Big River, carrying a fish in his mouth. He had only taken two bites from it.

Bowser the Hound loves hunting for the thrill of the chase, not to harm anyone. Farmer Brown's boy stopped using his gun to befriend the animals.

It was time for Reddy to have some fun. He boldly sat in front of Bowser, grinning mischievously. Bowser, taken aback, growled and lunged at Reddy, but the chain held him back.
