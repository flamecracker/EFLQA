Have you ever wondered how snow is formed and where it comes from? It is created high in the sky from vapor and falls from the clouds like rain. Each snowflake is unique, just like people.

Yet, the most remarkable light comes from God, warming our fields and blessing us with harvests.

"This passage teaches us about God's eternal love and the importance of helping others. God's love is compared to the changing seasons, always present and never failing.

Once upon a time, a young boy and his father worked together to remove the last nail from a door. The boy was overjoyed as they finally pulled out the nail, but he noticed the marks it left behind.

Lesson number two, Discipline. This knife has been through many trials and tests. The steel had to endure a tough, hot process before being tempered and sharpened. I sometimes resist certain processes, but then I remember my knife and understand the importance of discipline. The third lesson is Neatness. Imagine the man buying this knife, choosing it from a display of various kinds. He picked this knife for its graceful lines and smooth pearl handle. People are drawn to neatness. The fourth lesson is Usefulness. This knife serves various purposes with its big and small blades, a file, and tiny scissors. Life's true test is usefulness.

"I have a unique book filled with letters written by a remarkable man, Theodore Roosevelt, to his children. How fortunate were his children to receive such heartfelt letters! Not many fathers take the time to write to their children like our great president did. We should all aspire to be like Roosevelt, appreciating the value of written expressions of love. The 119th Psalm is exceptional as it solely focuses on God's laws and commandments. Each verse emphasizes the importance of following God's word. Young readers, I encourage you to read this Psalm and reflect on its teachings. When you reach the 94th verse, pause and sincerely say, ""I am thine."" May you always belong to God.

The eye is the most delicate part of our body, vulnerable to harm. It's amazing that many of us go through life without eye injuries. God has given us eyelids as a protective guard. They close whenever danger approaches, shielding our eyes effectively. Moving from the simplest form of life to the highest, the soul of man, each of us possesses something eternal - the soul, akin to God. To protect our souls, God provides faith, a sense of right and wrong, conscience, and guidance through Christian homes, the Church, and supportive communities. Different types of yokes make carrying heavy loads easier. Jesus understood their value, promising to share the burden with his followers. Sometimes, we must heed advice, especially from respected sources like the renowned English novelist, Charles Dickens.|['1. What does the text suggest about the vulnerability of the eye?\nA.

Charles Dickens' youngest son, Edward, departed for Australia at sixteen. His father penned a parting letter, emphasizing the value of the New Testament and the significance of personal prayers. Dickens instilled the importance of truthfulness and duty, urging his son to follow the teachings of the Bible. Similarly, Dr. Harper, the esteemed President of Chicago University, reflected on his youth, expressing a wish for greater attention to church, academics, and respect for his parents. The process of building a church, stone by stone, illustrates the dedication and effort required for monumental achievements. Each stone and tile was carefully placed, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and diligence in reaching goals.|"[""1.

Today, it is snowing outside. Did you know that in just one square mile, one foot of snow would weigh a whopping 65,000 tons? Imagine this: if you were to load a ton of snow onto each sled and line them up with horses, the procession of sleds carrying the snow could stretch all the way from Philadelphia to New York and even further up the Hudson River towards Albany. And that's just from one square mile! There are thousands of square miles covered in snow every winter. But have you ever wondered how snow forms? It starts as tiny flakes, falling one by one. To help you understand, let's look at this magnet and some nails. The magnet lifts up small nails easily, just like how it's easier to respond to good influences when you're young. As we grow older, it becomes harder to respond to positive influences. The larger nails represent young adults and mature individuals, showing how important it is to heed positive calls early in life. Lastly, the rusty, large nail symbolizes a life deep in sin, needing a strong and loving call to turn towards goodness. So, it's best to respond to positive influences early and eagerly, just like the man who sought a better life for his family during a famine long ago.|"['1.

"Many years ago, after the Pilgrim Fathers landed in New England, John Eliot, a dedicated Christian missionary, arrived in America. He spent sixty years in Massachusetts, most among the Native Americans. Known as the ""Apostle to the Indians,"" he learned their language, translated Scriptures, and shared his motto, ""Prayer and pains, through faith in Christ, will do anything."" Just as Eliot helped the Indians, someone helped humanity with the invention of the alphabet, forming words, sentences, and conveying ideas. The Bible has been translated into many languages, aiming for all to read God's message. A stroll in a park taught a lesson: a pine tree's voice corrected a slouched posture, reminding to stand tall and walk with pride."|"['1.

"As I walked away from the pine tree, lost in my thoughts, a new voice caught my attention. ""Be kind and fair, never achieve success through scolding or insults. Embody fairness and justice. Be like Christ, a true Christian gentleman."" I searched around but found no one in sight. ""Here I am,"" the voice spoke again. I gazed ahead to see a graceful elm tree, smiling and bowing courteously. ""I will try to follow your advice,"" I replied. Continuing on, I awaited more wisdom from the trees.

In life, we are all like shoppers in a big store. Just like when we visit Wanamaker's, we must buy something. But in the store of Life, we must also make choices. What do we buy? We can choose anything that is true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report. It's like selecting our favorite food when we are hungry. Bread is called the staff of life because it gives us strength. Even though we enjoy ice cream, cake, and other foods, a meal is not complete without bread.

God's standards are universal and unchanging. Whether in Ohio, Mexico, England, or Spain, right and wrong remain the same. Just as stealing is wrong in Germany and Brazil, murder has always been and will always be condemned. The Ten Commandments serve as guidelines for our actions. Imagine being measured by God's standards, like being measured in height. We all need to measure ourselves against the life of Jesus. Sleep is a precious gift from God, not just for us but for all creatures. Did you know elephants and horses sleep standing up? Birds often tuck their heads under their feathers.

Doors come in different forms, from the wooden doors of houses to the metaphorical doors of life. While physical doors are made of wood and swing on hinges, the doors of life are shaped by our will. Just like heavy doors feel light when hung on delicate hinges, the doors of life are guided by love. Knobs and locks play key roles too. Knobs, like courtesy, allow us to open doors, while faith acts as the lock that secures the doors of life. It's like a paradox - you lock your door by opening it.

This passage emphasizes the importance of preparation, growth, and making the best of one's circumstances. The Bible is highlighted as a valuable and accessible resource for spiritual guidance. Just like Chinese lilies that grow rapidly due to adequate preparation in the dark, our lives also require preparation for future endeavors.

Have you ever heard a really loud noise before? Maybe the booming sound of thunder during a storm or a cannon being fired? Well, I once experienced the most terrifying noise when a boiler exploded near my home. It happened one evening during a prayer meeting. The whole town heating plant went up in a massive explosion. The church nearby was plunged into darkness, the walls shook, and windows shattered. People were so scared that they dropped to their knees and crawled towards the door.

It is a package sent to missionary families with essentials like clothing, bedding, and sometimes toys. In a city, children from a Sunday School once filled a box with gifts. They gave clothes, books, and toys. One girl even donated her beloved doll, wanting to make another child happy.

"After a fire destroyed their church, the community gathered to decide its fate. They pondered whether to rebuild in the same spot or find a new location. Eventually, they chose to construct a new church at Copley Square. Years passed, and the church became known as ""Phillips Brooks' Church,"" reflecting the influence of a beloved figure. Another significant story revolves around a Christmas hymn. Phillips Brooks, during a trip to the Holy Land, penned a poem for his Sunday School children, which was later set to music and sung in Trinity Church, Philadelphia. This hymn, a beautiful Christmas tradition, holds a special place in the hearts of many. Additionally, the tale of a Christmas tree in a tropical setting highlights the symbolic messages it carries - eternal life represented by its evergreen nature, the guiding star atop signifying higher aspirations, the lights symbolizing Jesus bringing light to the world, and the gifts beneath mirroring God's ultimate gift of love in Christ."|"[""1.
