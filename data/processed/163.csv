Once upon a time, a Fairy named Thistledown was welcomed by a group of Spirits who asked him to join their dance. However, Thistledown was too sad to participate. He shared his story with them, and a Spirit named Sparkle, adorned with diamonds, offered him a chance to earn a golden bell by completing a task.
