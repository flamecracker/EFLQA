For three days, the Spring sun had been shining brightly over Lake Geneva, casting a golden glow on the water. Storms had passed, leaving a gentle breeze rustling through the ash-trees. Buttercups and daisies sparkled in the sunlight, while a brook fed primroses and anemones. Old Mary Ann, known throughout the neighborhood, sat by the brook with her basket. She had led a varied life, far from her home, speaking a foreign language. As she gazed at the flowers and birds, memories of her past flooded back. She reminisced about her childhood in a village called Zweisimmen, where her grandfather's military legacy influenced her family. Despite hardships, she persevered, caring for her son Sami after her husband's death.

Mary Ann decided not to let her son go alone, so she accompanied him as they wandered over the mountains.

As Sami turned seven, Mary Ann decided to teach him to read instead of sending him to a French school. To her surprise, Sami quickly grasped reading and found joy in learning.

"""Yes, indeed,"" agreed Sami's grandmother. ""We will stay until we're rested and when it grows dark, we'll leave. That's when the night-owl hoots."" Sami agreed, not wanting to hear the owl. As they reached the wall, a cool shadow covered it, the brook murmured below, and birds sang cheerfully in the trees. Sami noticed a bird singing ""Trust! Trust! Trust!"" above the others. His grandmother explained it was a finch, reminding him to trust in the dear Lord for safety and happiness.

As the sun set and vanished, the grandmother led Sami by the hand through the meadows and up the vine-covered hill to Chailly village. A few days later, Mary Ann was too tired to rise. Sami sat patiently by her side, waiting for her to awaken and make coffee. When she finally stirred, she grasped Sami's hand and whispered urgently. She instructed him to go to Zweisimmen, find the sergeant, his cousin, and work hard. She revealed money in a bag for him, urging him not to spend it recklessly. Sami was to remember his promise, pray for comfort, associate with good people, and live a righteous life.

Malon, a kind man, offered to accompany Sami part of the way until they found someone who could help him further. Sami, tearfully saying goodbye to his grandmother, was led by a woman to Malon's cart. Sami, feeling lost and alone, followed Malon along a familiar path to a train station. On the train, Sami, not understanding the conversations around him, wept quietly. When they reached a stop, Malon and Sami got off, and Sami was left alone in a large room. Later, a man and a servant spoke to Sami in his language, informing him that he was not in Zweisimmen but in Aigle.

The man in charge provided Sami with bread and eggs, which he kindly placed in the boy's pocket even though Sami wasn't hungry. Leading Sami outside, they found a large coach with two horses and a driver waiting. The driver lifted Sami onto the coach and drove away. Despite the exciting ride, Sami felt sad thinking about his grandmother who had passed away. The driver comforted Sami by listening to his story about his grandmother and his journey to find his cousin in Zweisimmen. Eventually, Sami fell asleep in the coach and woke up in a room with unfamiliar white walls. The coachman then took Sami to the sergeant's house where he was met with curiosity by a woman and three boys.

The farmer's wife was not keen on adding a fourth child to her already noisy household, but despite her protests, Sami was welcomed into the family. The boys, Stöffi, Michael, and Uli, showed Sami the ropes, from field work to playing tricks. Sami, unfamiliar with farm chores, struggled but persevered, remembering his grandmother's lessons. When it was time for lunch, they sat under a tree enjoying bread and pear juice. Stöffi mentioned a bear in the village that evening, wanting to go see it.

Sami had a tough day. He was late coming home and too tired to eat. Even though he wanted to sleep, his mind was restless with worries about his work, the farmer, and his grandmother's comforting words. Feeling alone and troubled, he prayed for strength. The next morning, the farmer's wife woke them up harshly. Sami learned to work hard, always finishing on time, unlike his brothers who tried to avoid work.

The Summer and Autumn passed, and a cold Winter arrived. No more work in the fields, but plenty to do in the barn and house to help the farmer and his wife. Sami helped while the boys went to school. They often fought, and Sami got the worst of it. In the evenings, the boys did their schoolwork while Sami cut fruit. Arguments erupted, and Sami was blamed for disturbances.

After safely navigating the rough street and onto the meadow road, two pushing and two pulling, a break was in order. They paused under the shade of the first large pear-tree, laying down to gaze at the blue sky. Above in the pear-tree, birds sang joyfully, one distinct bird calling out a special note, believed to be the rain bird signaling an impending shower. Suddenly, chaos erupted as the cart overturned, spilling crockery everywhere. Stöffi, Sami, Michael, and Uli hurried back to the house, only to be met with anger and accusations from the farmer and his wife.

"Sami woke up to the golden sunshine and the birds singing their morning song. Feeling protected by the dear Lord through the night, he sang a hymn of praise and thanksgiving. This newfound assurance filled him with hope to find food and work. Following his grandmother's advice to work after prayer, Sami set off. Avoiding the lake to steer clear of the tinker, he walked up a field road. Along the way, he encountered a girl pushing a child's carriage adorned with a white cover embroidered with a wreath of blue silk. Sami was intrigued by the strange figures on the carriage, realizing they were letters.
