"Approximately twenty-five years later, Isaiah Thomas from Worcester, Massachusetts reprinted this book in our country. Isaiah Thomas reprinted several copies of this edition, and one of these preserved copies has been photographed and reproduced in facsimile by W. H. Whitmore from Boston. Other publishers also reprinted the English edition, including one for John Newbery's grandson, Francis Power, in 1791. In 1810, a new collection of melodies titled ""Gammer Gurton's Garland"" emerged. This collection was seen as a rival to Mother Goose, containing most of her verses along with less interesting ones from various sources. Despite Gammer Gurton's brief popularity, Mother Goose was revived around 1825 by a Boston firm, Munroe and Francis, and has remained famous since then. The current edition of ""Mother Goose"" aims to preserve the best verses that became popular in England and America, following editions published in 1791 and 1833."|"['1.
