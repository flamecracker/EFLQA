Mr. Bunker shook off the snow and the children, then removed his overcoat. Russ grabbed the bag, Rose and Laddie each took an arm, and they were carried upstairs by Mr. Bunker.

Russ and Rose stood on the deck watching as the land slowly disappeared from view. They expected it to vanish like a fade-out in a movie, but it took longer than they thought. When the call for lunch came, they went below. The purser had arranged a table for the Bunker family where they could dine in peace. The ship had few children, but the purser was kind to them.

The excitement of Russ and Rose Bunker grew as they watched a sea-eagle approaching their ship. Would the _Kammerboy_ outrun the bird? The ship sailed smoothly, making it hard for the eagle to land. The children raced to the bow, hoping the bird would perch there. The sea-eagle's majestic wings were a mix of black and pearl-gray feathers. Despite being injured and far from land, the bird showed incredible courage. After a struggle, the eagle made a final effort to land on the ship. With cheers from the children and other passengers, the lookout officer caught the bird safely.

"The crew discovered a bullet wound in the wing of a large bird aboard their ship. It was suspected that the bird was shot at by an irresponsible person from a small boat.

The quartermaster agreed, calling it a wicked act. Despite the bird's injury, they believed it would recover soon and hoped to release it before reaching Charleston.

Russ complimented Mun Bun on his speaking skills, although Mun Bun was unaware of his pronunciation errors. The sea-eagle was to be released before Mun Bun could master the eagle language. The quartermaster, who was a friend of Russ and Rose, brought raw meat for the eagle, but the children had to leave for breakfast before the bird ate. Later, Russ and Rose heard a crackling sound near the wireless house on the deck. They found a man inside operating strange machinery. The man explained the process of sending private messages via wireless. Excitement arose on the deck as officers spotted a lumber-laden vessel in distress. The crew had jettisoned the deckload of lumber, and the ship's torn sails indicated trouble. The wireless operator assured Russ and Rose that help was on the way for the stranded schooner.|['1.

Rose marveled at the wireless mast on the ship, finding it amusingly wireless. The short wires puzzled them, so they sought Daddy Bunker for more on the wireless wonder. The other Bunker kids were engrossed in watching a lumber schooner. After signaling with flags, the steamship sped off, leaving the schooner's masts almost out of sight.

Russ was preoccupied and didn't want to talk about what was bothering him. He seemed silent at lunch, lost in thought. His family noticed but knew he would share when ready. After lunch, Russ disappeared to think. He returned with a game idea, avoiding the lifeboat and raft. He suggested exploring the ship and setting up a wireless mast. The children were fascinated by the ship's engines and the hot stoke hole. The warm Gulf Stream air made the journey pleasant. Two hours after passing a distressed schooner, they saw a revenue cutter heading to help. The lumber schooner would be towed to safety in Hampton Roads.|"['1.

During the journey aboard the ship, Russ Bunker acted strangely by avoiding the covered boat on the hurricane deck. This behavior puzzled his family, especially his father and sister Rose. At dinner, Mr. Bunker noticed Russ rushing around and decided to confront him. Startled, Russ was asked to reveal the contents of his pockets, suspecting he was hoarding food. Despite the mystery, Mr. Bunker advised Russ to confide in him if needed. Rose, curious about her brother's actions, observed him closely but refrained from teasing him. As the evening progressed, the siblings interacted with other passengers and children on the ship. Despite their activities, Rose sensed Russ's inner turmoil and decided to support him rather than question him further. The moonlit sea and a distant ship added a magical touch to the evening, captivating even the children on board.|"['1.

Rose found it puzzling that Russ didn't seem bothered by any punishment, and there was a mysterious sailor boy who knew Russ and Daddy Bunker well. Despite these mysteries, the children enjoyed good times on the ship, sailing through cloudless summer seas. They spotted warships in Charleston Harbor, where Daddy Bunker arranged for a lost boy to join their ship. The children admired the fleet's lights at night. The ship docked to unload, and they were excited to see the coast near Savannah. Laddie remarked that as long as they saw land, they knew North America was not lost. Mun Bun's attempt at dancing brought laughter. They released an angry sea-eagle named Red Eye from the turkey coop, adding to the excitement as they neared the end of their voyage.|"[""1.

The officer couldn't release the sea-eagle due to objections. The quartermaster feared the bird might forget to fly if caged too long. When finally set free, the eagle hesitated, then spread its wings and soared into the sky. The Bunkers arrived in Savannah, where they stayed at a nice hotel. Mr. Armatage, an old friend of Daddy Bunker's, visited them. He discussed business with Daddy Bunker and expressed his desire for their families to connect.

"The tall man praised the smart boy, admiring his quick wit. The next day, the group visited the Meiggs Plantation, a two-hour ride on a branch railroad.

The children were surprised by the number of colored children around the veranda. Rose thought there must be a nearby school on break.

"The Armatage family was known for their peculiar behavior towards the colored children on the plantation. They alternated between petting and quarreling with them, expecting various services while also giving them gifts. The white children were always accompanied by a group of colored boys and girls wherever they went. The quarters, where the colored people lived, were close but out of sight from the main house. The kitchen was in a separate building. The Armatage family had a special bond with Mammy June, who used to care for them when they were young. Mammy June now lived in her own little house, worrying about her youngest son who had left. The children of the Armatage family had endearing nicknames for the colored children, like ""Sneezer,"" and shared stories about their large extended family.

A group of white children strolled down a path, followed by a lively group of colored children. The latter sang, played, and danced like playful puppies in the surrounding woods. The oldest Armatage girl praised Sneezer's dancing skills. As they approached Mammy June's cabin, the Armatage girl warned the colored children not to come too close, playfully threatening to summon a ghost if they did. Mammy June welcomed the children with a warm smile, seated on her porch. She had cared for the Armatage children when they were young and had a special bond with them.
