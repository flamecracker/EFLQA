"When the cadets of Putnam Hall rushed to the parade ground, the sun shone brightly on the fifth of July, creating a perfect day. The camp was spotless, with Old Glory waving proudly on the tall flagstaff. Dick, Tom, and Sam were familiar characters to those who read ""The Rover Boys at School."" Sent from Valley Brook farm to Putnam Hall military academy, they formed strong bonds with Captain Victor Putnam. After various adventures, including a chase on the ocean and a hunt in Africa, they discovered hidden treasure. Following a scarlet-fever scare, the boys visited California for their health. In ""The Rover Boys in Camp,"" they returned to Putnam Hall for the annual encampment, facing challenges from bullies but emerging victorious. Captain Putnam praised the cadets' hard work, and Dick presented a silver and gold figure as a gift from the cadets to Captain Putnam."|[]|[]
William Philander Tubbs, trying to escape his teasing friends, found himself in a comical situation. He ended up with the wrong shoe and had to march to the military academy with the cadets. The journey was lively with drums and fifes playing. They camped out overnight in a big field. Despite missing their friends in Oakville, the cadets headed to Bramley and White Corners. Upon reaching the campsite, they set up tents and lit campfires. There were songs and practical jokes around the fire, with poor Hans being teased good-naturedly. William Philander Tubbs fell victim to a prank where his face was blackened, leaving him looking like a coal-black darkey. Despite his threats to take them to court, the culprits remained unknown. Tubbs' night of trials continued as burrs were placed under his cot covers.|['1.

After cleaning up, the aristocratic cadet blew out the borrowed light and got ready for bed. He accidentally laid on some burrs left by mischievous cadets. Frustrated, he cleaned his cot for a good quarter of an hour. Meanwhile, other tired Rovers quickly fell asleep after a long day. Link Smith, a cadet on guard duty, was tricked into revealing the Rover boys' sleeping spot to a mysterious figure. The mysterious figure, disguised as a cadet, sneaked towards the Rovers. Captain Putnam faced delays in starting the march back to the Hall. A robbery at Mr. Fairchild's shop caused a commotion. Captain Putnam arrived to handle the situation. Josiah Cotton found incriminating evidence addressed to Richard Rover. Captain Putnam advised caution due to the Rover family's wealth.

The news spread quickly among the battalion standing at parade rest that the Rovers were accused of a crime. Fred Garrison and others found it hard to believe. However, some, who were associated with the troublemakers Lew Flapp and Dan Baxter, were less convinced. Gassam, the farmer, advised confessing to clear their names. The Squire, aware of Captain Putnam's reputation, listened intently as Aaron Fairchild recounted the break-in at his shop. Captain Putnam explained the background of the troublemakers and assured the Squire of the Rovers' innocence. The constable, wary of the influence Captain Putnam held, agreed it was best to hold off on pressing charges until further investigation.|"['1.

The discussion lasted for a full hour, and the group then visited Aaron Fairchild's shop, but no clues were found. A wagon was arranged to take the captain and the boys to Putnam Hall, accompanied by the constable to collect a promised photograph. The ride was quiet, with little conversation. Upon reaching the Hall, the picture was handed over to Josiah Cotton, who left soon after. The three Rovers were then ushered into the captain's private office. While waiting for the marching battalion, they packed their belongings but couldn't focus on anything. Sam spotted their friends arriving but didn't feel up to meeting them. Captain Putnam interviewed the cadets who had been on duty that morning. One cadet admitted to sneaking out for apples, while another, Link Smith, seemed troubled and mentioned needing to speak to two friends urgently. The night before the Rover boys left for home, the cadets celebrated with a bonfire and singing. Later, a utility man mistook a poker for a hot iron, causing a commotion until Mrs. Green arrived with medicine for his indigestion from eating too much green corn.|"[""1.

"The matron sarcastically replied, ""Oh, no, of course not. I'll be thankful to find myself alive after you are all gone."" She then bounced off into the kitchen, slamming the door behind her. The general-utility man, startled by a hop-toad, flung it at Larry, who dodged, causing it to hit William Philander Tubbs in the face.

At ten o'clock, the three Rover boys departed for Cedarville in the school stage, driven by Peleg Snuggers. The stage was packed with cadets, followed by a wagon loaded with trunks.

Tom joked with his big brother about steering a girl into the smoking room. They rode across Swift River to the farm. At dinner, the boys were served by Alexander Pop, a kind man who used to work at Putnam Hall. The family enjoyed their meal, sharing stories about the Baxters and Lew Flapp. Mr. Rover mentioned a ship tied up in Steelville, ready to take them on an adventure. Sam explored Oak Run but found no changes. A barber hesitated to help Flapp, who then punched him and fled. Flapp tried to lose Sam near the cemetery's receiving vault.

Lew Flapp anxiously watched as Sam left. Lew was known to be a coward, and the fear of being arrested for the robbery of Aaron Fairchild's shop made him tremble. The widow who donated the new cemetery vault had a fear of burying people alive. She had an electric button inside the vault to open the door from the inside. A light was supposed to be near the button, but it wasn't there yet. Lew thought he was free and tried to open the door but hesitated when he saw Sam was out of sight. He explained to Jennie that he had locked a thief in the vault and needed help to take him to the police.

Dan Baxter was trying to persuade Lew Flapp to stay away from home due to a recent incident at White Corners. Flapp was hesitant as he feared facing his father's wrath.

Meanwhile, Sam faced a near-death experience in a river but managed to pull himself to safety using a tree root. Despite losing his cap, he continued his journey, wishing he had Flapp by his side.

Sam quickly changed into the clothes he had found in the cottage and thanked Jennie before heading off to Oak Run on the Rover family's best horse. The horse, named Chips, got scared by circus showbills and bolted, throwing Sam and his friend Fred off. Luckily, Dick Rover came to the rescue and calmed Chips down. The boys then planned to attend Frozzler's Grand Aggregation of Attractions circus in town. However, upon arrival, they discovered that the circus was falling apart due to financial troubles.

The show was divided into two tents, one for wild animals and the other for performances. The wild animal tent displayed eight wagon cages with a frail lion, a skinny tiger, raccoons, foxes, a small bear, and a bunch of monkeys. Two elderly elephants were also present, one nearly blind. Frozzler, the ringmaster, got upset with the mischievous monkeys but left them to their antics. In the main tent, reserved seats turned out to be fake, just painted chair bottoms. Despite the chaos, the show finally began with a parade of elephants, horseback riders, and dogs. The juggler made mistakes, and the clown Frozzler's antics caused laughter.

Early in the morning, the boys met Captain Starr before breakfast. The captain, a stout man with a thick mustache and bushy whiskers, had dreamy eyes that often glanced away. They explored the houseboat, finding it spotless with a living room, dining room, kitchen, and eight bedrooms. Each bedroom had two berths, and there was a bunk room for the crew and a small room for the captain. The living room had a piano and a bookcase filled with novels. The boys enjoyed fishing and a delicious lunch served by the colored man on board. They made their first stop at Pleasant Hills to visit Mrs. Laning's friend.

Songbird excitedly called out as a large river boat approached. Eager to catch the waves, the group swam out and waited for the towering swells to roll in. It was thrilling to bob up and down like corks. Despite warnings to stay back, Tom ventured too close to the steamboat, where the waves were especially large. Suddenly losing interest, Tom was surprised when Dick revealed a new electric pocket light, illuminating the surroundings. An unexpected confrontation ensued when Baxter angrily pushed over a pile of boards, causing Dick to fall. Later, Sam was knocked unconscious by a heavy wooden billet. The police captain promised to apprehend the troublemakers, but Baxter and Flapp fled that night. The group returned to the houseboat late, sharing a vague account of their encounter with the rascals in Penwick. Subsequent days were filled with enjoyable activities like swimming, fishing, and camping, as they continued their journey down the river.|"['1.

During those days, Dick observed Captain Starr behaving more strangely than usual. Sometimes he spoke pleasantly, but most of the time he was so quiet that it was hard to get him to talk. The following Monday, the _Dora_ had sailed down the Ohio River to Louisville. To avoid the river falls, they had passed through a canal and then sailed about eighteen miles to Skemport, named after Samuel Skem, a Kentucky horse dealer. Fred Garrison's friend from Skemport wanted to visit, so Fred, Tom, and Sam went ashore to meet him. Later, the friend invited everyone to visit a large horse farm nearby. Dora, Nellie, Dick, and Tom went horseback riding, but soon, screams were heard. Dick feared something had happened to the girls. He searched frantically but couldn't find them. Later, Dan Baxter and Lew Flapp, after a gambling loss, fled to a stable near the _Dora_ to escape trouble.|['1.

Dan Baxter and Lew Flapp devised a cunning plan to trick Captain Starr of the _Dora_ houseboat. Flapp agreed to deliver a message to the captain, luring him to the stable where they bound him with an old harness. They left him as a prisoner with a promise of a reward if he stayed quiet. Meanwhile, the two miscreants sneaked onto the houseboat, where they encountered Dora and Nellie. Baxter spun a tale about the captain being injured, distracting the girls. He then seized Dora and Flapp took Nellie, locking them in separate rooms. As the houseboat drifted down the river, the mist cloaked their escape, leaving the girls trapped and unaware of the danger they were in.|['1.

The _Dora_ was equipped with long sweeps for maneuvering in the river. In the mist and darkness, Dan Baxter and Lew Flapp struggled to steer the houseboat. Suddenly, a gasoline launch collided with them, causing panic. The men on the launch threatened the boys to keep their presence a secret. As another launch approached, the boys sought refuge inside the _Dora_. The first launch then towed the houseboat down the river. Inside, the boys found alcohol and planned to ransom the abducted girls for a hefty sum. They knew they needed to find a hiding spot quickly to evade capture by the authorities.|"['1.

Hamp Gouch suggested taking the houseboat up Shaggam Creek to hide from the horse thieves. They planned to bribe old Jake Shaggam to keep quiet. After much discussion, they agreed to go up the creek temporarily. The thieves cooked on the houseboat while Baxter and Flapp reluctantly joined them. Flapp, a coward, obeyed Baxter's orders. Dora and Nellie overheard the conversation but were too scared to call for help. The girls worried about their families and the Rovers. The group, except the women, set out to search for the missing girls. They rode into Skemport quietly. A doctor was sent to the stock farm to check on Mrs. Stanhope. They searched for the girls with lanterns. The tug captain prepared to move the boat down the river to find the girls, who were being held captive.|"['1.

The steam tug quickly caught up to the drifting houseboat on the river. Flapp and Hamp Gouch were waiting on deck. They decided to stop at Gridley's for breakfast, where they replenished their provisions. The captain used a spyglass to scan the river, spotting steamboats and sailboats in the distance. They made a brief stop at Smuggs' Landing to send messages. Tom suggested a swift run down the river to search for the missing houseboat. The group decided to follow his plan. They sent a message indicating they were still on the houseboat's trail. After spending the night in a small town, they resumed their search at dawn, planning to explore every stream they encountered. Baxter and Flapp had sent a message demanding a ransom for Dora and Nellie's safe return.|"['1.
