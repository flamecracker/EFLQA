Greece, also known as Hel´las, is a small but significant country in Europe. Surrounded by mountains and the Mediterranean Sea, it has a rich history dating back thousands of years. The early Greeks, like the Pelasgians, were a wild and primitive people who lived in forests and caves, hunting with stone tools. They wore animal skins and lived in tribes led by chiefs. In contrast, the Egyptians and Phoenicians were advanced civilizations with knowledge of writing, tools, and shipbuilding. Egyptian prince In´a-chus introduced the Greeks to fire, cooking, and building techniques, helping them progress from primitive to more civilized ways of life. The Greeks learned to build sturdy stone walls without mortar, a skill that impressed later generations.|['1. What is the main focus of the text passage?\nA.

During ancient times in Greece, the great giants known as Cyclopes built massive walls that were named Cyclopean. Legends were told of these giants with one eye in the middle of their foreheads. Inachus, an Egyptian, taught the Pelasgians how to build and established the city of Argos. A devastating earthquake struck, causing chaos and flooding. The Pelasgians fled to the hills, but many perished. Survivors, led by Cecrops, settled in Greece and learned to cultivate crops, make clothing, and build towns. Cecrops founded Athens, which was named after the goddess Athena. Other princes followed, teaching various skills, including beekeeping and writing. Phoenician Cadmus founded Thebes and introduced trade and navigation. Egyptian Danaus settled in Argolis, teaching the Pelasgians new arts and founding religious festivals.

The ancient Pelasgians built tombs and treasure houses for kings with swords, spears, and gold ornaments. Thin gold masks covered the faces of the dead in these tombs. Deucalion, a leader of the Thessalians, was believed to be a descendant of the gods. After a flood, Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha were the only survivors. They were instructed to throw their mother's bones behind them, which they interpreted as throwing stones. From these stones, a new race emerged. Deucalion's sons, Amphictyon and Hellen, became kings. Amphictyon formed a council to defend against invaders, naming it the Amphictyonic Council. Hellen's sons, Dorus, Æolus, and Xuthus, inherited his kingdom. Xuthus sought refuge in Athens and later founded Achaia and Ionia.

Long ago, the Hellenes sailed to Crete, ruled by wise King Minos. His laws were admired by all Greeks. When he passed, they believed he judged in Hades. Daedalus, his subject, was wiser, inventing tools and rigging sails. These sails were called wings, enabling ships to sail. Daedalus built a maze, escaping with his son Icarus using wings made of feathers and wax. Icarus flew too close to the sun, falling into the sea. Daedalus flew safely to Greece. Pelops coined money in Peloponnesus, while others sailed to form colonies. Heroes fought robbers, earning the Heroic Age title.

In ancient Greece, the Dorians, who helped the Heraclidæ regain their land, found the new territory better than their mountain homes. They then drove the Ionians out, who then settled in Athens, nearby islands, and the coast of Asia Minor. The Ionians founded Ionia and towns like Eph´e-sus and Mi-le´tus. Codrus, the Athenian king, learned from an oracle that the army whose king died would win. He disguised himself as a soldier, sacrificed his life, and led the Athenians to victory against the Spartans. Codrus' death led to a vow never to have another king in Athens.

Sparta, an ancient city with a rich history, was once governed by the Heraclidae after their return from exile. Initially led by Aristodemus, the city was renamed after their ancestor, Lacedaemon, and the surrounding region became known as Laconia.

The original Laconians continued to live in the area, providing agricultural labor for the Spartans, while prisoners of war became slaves known as Helots. Lycurgus, a prominent figure in Spartan history, played a vital role in shaping the city's laws and customs. He implemented strict laws aimed at fostering goodness and health among the Spartans.

In ancient Sparta, young boys were taught the dangers of excessive drinking by observing a Helot, a slave, who was given abundant wine until he fell into a drunken stupor. The boys were then shown the consequences of such behavior, being told that a man who drinks too much is unworthy of respect. This early lesson instilled in the Spartan boys the importance of moderation in drinking. As they grew older, the boys became teachers themselves, passing on their knowledge to younger children. Spartan girls were also trained rigorously in physical activities like wrestling and running, as well as in intellectual pursuits like reading and writing. They were expected to be strong, intelligent, and capable to support their future families. The Spartans valued strength, intelligence, and self-discipline, as taught by their revered leader Lycurgus.|['1.

Aristodemus, faced with a dire situation where his people were starving, sought guidance from an oracle. The oracle advised that victory would come through a battle if a king sacrificed his daughter. Reluctant to harm his child, Aristodemus resisted but eventually sacrificed her for the greater good. The Messenians, moved by his sacrifice, rallied behind him and launched a surprise attack on the Spartans, resulting in a significant victory. The Spartans, realizing they needed divine help, sought an Athenian leader. To their surprise, they received a humble, unassuming schoolmaster named Tyrtaeus. Despite initial skepticism, Tyrtaeus's patriotic songs inspired the Spartans to victory over the Messenians. After the battle, the Spartans cruelly threw the prisoners into a pit, assuming Aristodemus was dead. However, Aristodemus miraculously survived the fall and was aided by a fox in escaping the pit.|"['1.

Long ago, in the land of Messenia, a brave chief named Aristomenes found himself imprisoned by the Spartans. However, with the help of a clever fox, Aristomenes managed to escape. The people of Messenia were overjoyed to see their beloved chief return, and they cared for him until he regained his strength. Despite Aristomenes' courage, Messenia eventually fell to the Spartans, leading to the end of the Second Messenian War. Many people fled to Italy and Sicily, where they established Greek colonies. One of these cities, Messina, still stands today. In Olympia, a temple dedicated to Zeus was built by Hercules, attracting people from all over for athletic games and religious celebrations. The Olympic games became a tradition, with victors receiving crowns of wild olive leaves. The temple was adorned with statues and artwork, including a magnificent statue of Jupiter by the sculptor Phidias. The Olympic games held every four years became a significant event in Greek history, with people from various regions participating in contests, poetry recitals, and religious ceremonies.|['Question 1:\nWhat event led to the end of the Second Messenian War?\nA) The escape of Aristomenes with the help of a fox\nB) The construction of a temple dedicated to Zeus in Olympia\nC) The establishment of Greek colonies in Italy and Sicily\nD) The victory of the Spartans over Messenia\nE) The creation of the Olympic games', 'Question 2:\nWhich city was established by people fleeing from Messenia after its fall to the Spartans?\nA) Athens\nB) Sparta\nC) Messina\nD) Olympia\nE) Thebes', 'Question 3:\nWhat did victors of the Olympic games receive as a prize?\nA) Crowns of wild olive leaves\nB) Gold coins\nC) Silver medals\nD) Laurel wreaths\nE) Trophies', 'Question 4:\nWho built a temple dedicated to Zeus in Olympia?\nA) Hercules\nB) Aristomenes\nC) Phidias\nD) Jupiter\nE) The Spartans', 'Question 5:\nWhat kind of artwork adorned the temple dedicated to Zeus in Olympia?\nA) Pottery\nB) Frescoes\nC) Mosaics\nD) Statues\nE) Tapestries', 'Question 6:\nWhat became a significant event in Greek history, attracting people from various regions?\nA) The establishment of Greek colonies\nB) The fall of Messenia to the Spartans\nC) The construction of the temple of Zeus in Olympia\nD) The Second Messenian War\nE) The Olympic games held every four years']|['D) The victory of the Spartans over Messenia', 'C) Messina', 'A) Crowns of wild olive leaves', 'A) Hercules', 'D) Statues', 'E) The Olympic games held every four years']
In ancient Greece, victors in the games were awarded medals and wreaths of wild olive and laurel leaves. The people no longer wore crowns of flowers or made sacrifices to the old gods as Greece had become a Christian country. Among the celebrated athletes was Milo of Croton, known for his incredible strength. He trained rigorously from a young age, even carrying a calf daily to increase his muscle. Eventually, he became so strong that he could carry a full-grown ox with ease. Milo once saved his companions by holding up a collapsing roof with his powerful arms. Unfortunately, his pride in his strength led to his demise. Another athlete, Theagenes, faced jealousy from a rival who met a tragic end under Theagenes' statue. The statue was cast into the sea, but a plague only ended after it was restored, leading the Greeks to revere it. Women also participated in special Olympic events like the torch race, where they competed to keep their torches lit to win prizes.|"['1.

Athens, a great city of ancient Greece, had rulers called archons who were initially chosen for life but later elected by the people. Draco, a severe archon, created strict laws, punishing even minor offenses harshly. The laws caused fear among the Athenians, leading to unrest. Cylon, trying to become king, seized the Acropolis but failed. His followers sought refuge in a temple, fearing retribution. They were persuaded to leave under the promise of safety, holding a cord tied to a statue. When the cord broke, the archon ordered their execution, claiming the goddess had withdrawn her protection. This event marked a turbulent time in Athens, with power struggles between the rich and poor, culminating in a need for new laws and governance.|"['Question 1: What title did the rulers of Athens hold in ancient Greece?\nA) Senators\nB) Archons\nC) Emperors\nD) Pharaohs\nE) Chancellors', 'Question 2: Who was the severe archon known for creating strict laws in Athens?\nA) Pericles\nB) Draco\nC) Aristotle\nD) Socrates\nE) Plato', 'Question 3: What action did Cylon take in an attempt to become king of Athens?\nA) Seized the marketplace\nB) Seized the Acropolis\nC) Seized the harbor\nD) Seized the temple of Athena\nE) Seized the city walls', ""Question 4: What did Cylon's followers do after failing to take control of Athens?\nA) Fled the city\nB) Sought refuge in a temple\nC) Declared war on the archons\nD) Started a rebellion\nE) Asked for forgiveness"", ""Question 5: What did the archon order when the cord held by Cylon's followers broke?\nA) Banishment\nB) Imprisonment\nC) Execution\nD) Exile\nE) Pardon"", 'Question 6: What marked a turbulent time in Athens, leading to power struggles and a need for new laws?\nA) The death of a king\nB) The invasion of a neighboring city\nC) The failed coup by Cylon\nD) A natural disaster\nE) A successful military campaign']"|['B) Archons', 'B) Draco', 'B) Seized the Acropolis', 'B) Sought refuge in a temple', 'C) Execution', 'C) The failed coup by Cylon']
After Cylon's death and the murder of his followers, Athens faced many troubles. People believed the gods were punishing them for breaking promises, especially Megacles. The terrified citizens voted to exile Megacles and his family, the Alcmaeonidae. They even dug up his ancestors' bones and cast them out of Attica to purify the city. Seeking a holy man to cleanse Athens, they called upon Epimenides, a renowned poet who had once slept for 58 years in a cave. After purifying the city, he humbly asked for a twig from the sacred olive tree. With peace restored, the Athenians turned to Solon, a wise lawmaker, to improve their laws. Solon's reforms included fair treatment for all citizens, a court of law, and the right for the accused to defend themselves. He ensured that his laws were followed by making the Athenians promise to obey them for ten years before departing on his travels.|"[""1.

Thespis, a clever Greek, saw the growing popularity of entertainment and built the first basic theater to please the audience. The initial shows were simple, with actors performing songs roughly. Over time, plays became more intricate, depicting stories told by storytellers. Some, like Solon, disapproved, claiming Thespis promoted falsehoods. Despite criticisms, actors persisted, attracting larger crowds. Eventually, poets wrote plays, enhancing the performances. The audience grew, leading to the construction of a massive amphitheater seating thousands. Greek actors wore masks and costumes, emoting through recitals and choral singing. Plays evoked varied emotions, from tears to laughter. The tragedies and comedies penned by renowned Greek playwrights are still read today. Pisistratus, Solon's nephew, cunningly gained support from the poor Athenians by feigning attacks from the aristocrats, eventually seizing power through deceit and manipulation.|"['1.

Pisistratus, a former favorite of the Athenians, deceived them to gain power, becoming a master of the town. Despite this, he ruled wisely, improving the city with temples and an aqueduct for clean water. He gathered and preserved Homer's poems, enhancing Greek culture. Although called a tyrant for ruling without consulting the people, Pisistratus was mourned upon his death. His sons succeeded him but later indulged in pleasure over duty. Harmodius and Aristogiton, respected friends, plotted against the tyrants, leading to a failed attempt and the torture of a brave woman named Leæna.

Four years passed, and the Athenians eagerly awaited the chance to remove Hippias. Megacles, who had been banished for a crime, sought to return. The Alcmæonidæ, tasked with rebuilding the Delphi temple, were aided by the priests who desired their return to Athens. The Spartans, acting on the oracle's advice, waged war against Athens to oust Hippias. With a clever move, Hippias was forced to leave, seeking allies against Athens. The people rejoiced, honoring Harmodius and Aristogiton. The Alcmæonidæ returned, influencing Athenian government. The laws were adjusted to empower the people, making the government more democratic. Clis´the-nes proposed ten generals to rule in turns. Ostracism allowed citizens to exile disliked individuals. Hippias sought aid from Darius, the ruler of a vast empire, governed by satraps.

Darius, a powerful king, learned of the Athenian revolt and welcomed Hippias, an exiled tyrant seeking support. Hippias, escorted through a grand palace, met Darius in a lavish chamber. The king, adorned in gold and jewels, listened to Hippias' plea for aid against the Athenians. Meanwhile, Democedes, a Greek doctor in Darius' service, healed the king's foot, earning favor and becoming court physician. Democedes later escaped Persia, returning to Greece.

"Darius, the Persian king, was determined to conquer Greece. He sent messengers demanding that Greek towns recognize him as their ruler by offering ""earth and water."" Most towns surrendered out of fear, but Sparta and Athens refused. The Spartans even killed the messengers. This enraged Darius, who quickly prepared a massive army under generals Datis and Artaphernes, aided by the traitor Hippias. The Persian fleet set sail for Greece, but disasters struck. A storm destroyed many ships, and the army faced fierce Scythians. The Persians were so scared they almost turned back. Undeterred, Darius rebuilt his fleet and army, ready to march once more.

In ancient Athens, Miltiades, a hero of the people after his victory at Marathon, faced envy from Themistocles, who grew jealous of his friend's success. When Miltiades misused his power, Themistocles openly showed his dislike. Seeking revenge, Miltiades led his fleet to the Island of Pa´ros, but his actions led to his downfall. Convicted of a crime, Miltiades died in prison, abandoned by those he had once saved. His son, Cimon, faced the cruel judges to claim his father's body. The ungrateful Athenians, forgetting Miltiades' past glory, hastily buried him in secret. Meanwhile, the threat of the Great King's return loomed, leading to conflicts between generals Aristides and Themistocles.

The new king, Xerxes, was persuaded by his courtiers and exiled Greeks in his palace to prepare for war against the Greeks. Despite his initial reluctance, he finally agreed to lead the army himself. For eight years, troops were trained, weapons made, provisions gathered, and roads built across Asia. A vast fleet was ready, causing fear among the Greeks who remembered the previous defeat at Marathon. To avoid Xerxes' wrath, two young Spartans, Bulis and Sperthias, offered their lives in exchange for the Persians killed by their people. They bravely stood before Xerxes, refusing to bow, and offered themselves as atonement. Xerxes, moved by their courage, spared them and even rewarded them. Eventually, Xerxes led a massive army towards Greece, but his grand plans faced a setback when a storm destroyed the bridges he had built. Despite his anger, Xerxes showed a moment of vulnerability, realizing the fleeting nature of power and glory.|"['1.

The king was soon consoled and led his army across the bridge with his elite soldiers, the Immortals. This procession lasted seven days and nights, with a continuous stream of soldiers, slaves, and wagons passing over the Hellespont. The sight was awe-inspiring for the onlookers, as they witnessed the grand chariot, the Immortals in their shining armor, and the war machines designed to instill fear in the Greeks. Xerxes had a canal dug to ensure his fleet's safety, and news of his impending invasion reached Athens, causing fear among the people. Miltiades' death led to the recall of Aristides, who forgave past grievances to unite with Themistocles in defending Athens. Despite challenges, Themistocles rallied some allies and convinced the Spartans to defend the pass of Thermopylae against the Persian invasion.|"[""1.

"As the archers advanced, they unleashed a barrage of arrows so dense that they seemed to block out the sun. Witnessing this, one of the allies rushed to inform Leonidas. Unfazed by the news, Leonidas calmly remarked, ""Very well; then we can fight in the shade."" Xerxes, seeing the Greeks' determination, ordered the battle to commence. Despite the Persians' efforts, they were repeatedly repelled by the Greek defenders. The Persian soldiers, in awe of the Greeks' bravery, hesitated to advance and only moved under threat of punishment. Frustrated, Xerxes sent his elite Immortals to break through, but even they were forced to retreat by the resolute Greeks. Amidst the chaos, a traitorous Greek shepherd, Ephialtes, offered to guide the Persians through a secret path. This treachery led to a surprise attack on the Greeks, who fought valiantly until the end, refusing to surrender despite overwhelming odds. The Persians, now able to advance, continued their march toward Athens, but were met with a fierce thunderstorm at Delphi, halting their progress. In the meantime, the Greek fleet at Artemisium guarded against the Persian ships until news of Leonidas' death and the fall of Thermopylae reached them, prompting them to sail swiftly to defend Athens."|"['1.

"During the war with the Persians, the Greeks faced a tough decision. The allies retreated to the Peloponnesus and built a wall at the Isthmus of Corinth to block the Persians. The Athenians were left alone and debated whether to abandon their city. They sought advice from the oracle at Delphi, which cryptically said, ""The wooden walls will defend you and your children."" Themistocles interpreted this to mean their ships, not the city's walls. The Athenians evacuated to their ships, leaving Athens to the Persians. Despite initial reluctance, the Greeks, led by Themistocles, defeated the Persians at the Battle of Salamis. Xerxes, seeing his fleet destroyed, retreated, leaving Mardonius to continue the conquest, but the Greeks were ready to fight back under the leadership of Pausanias."|"['1.

The Greeks faced the Persians at Plataea and Mycale, emerging victorious despite being outnumbered. Pausanias, a Spartan, marveled at the luxury of the Persian camp, contrasting it with Spartan simplicity. Pausanias highlighted this difference by dining plainly while the Persians feasted lavishly. The Greeks honored their gods by sending spoils to sanctuaries and erecting temples. With the Persians ousted from Greece, the battle shifted to Asia Minor. The Greeks, including the Athenians, triumphed, sparking hope and alliance among the Ionian cities. Athens, though in ruins, found hope in the miraculous regrowth of the sacred olive tree, a sign of Athena's favor. When the Spartans objected to Athens rebuilding its walls, Themistocles strategized to ensure the city's fortification.|"['1.

When Themistocles arrived in Sparta, he cleverly delayed discussions until the walls were high enough to defend. This angered the Spartans, who eagerly awaited a chance to punish the Athenians. Pausanias, the Spartan king, grew arrogant after his victory over the Persians. He became unbearable, donned Persian attire, and sought to rule Greece. The ephors uncovered his treachery, leading to his death by starvation in a temple. Themistocles, accused of involvement, was ostracized by the Athenians. Exiled, he found refuge with the Persian king, Artaxerxes. Despite the king's offer to lead a Persian army against the Greeks, Themistocles refused, remaining loyal to his homeland. Aristides, known as the Just, took charge after Themistocles' exile, overseeing public affairs until his death. His selflessness and integrity were later honored by the Athenians. Cimon, son of Miltiades, led the Athenian army to victories over the Persians and used the spoils to enhance Athens, including expanding the Academy gardens and bringing Theseus' remains to the city for burial.|"['1.

Cimon, a wealthy and generous man in Athens, always welcomed guests into his home with a bountiful table. He was known for his kindness towards the poor, often sending servants with full purses to secretly help those in need. Despite his past laziness, Cimon transformed into a thoughtful citizen under the guidance of Aristides the Just. Pericles, another wealthy Athenian, gained influence by connecting with the poorer citizens through eloquent speeches. As Athens faced challenges, including aiding the Spartans after an earthquake and preparing for a Persian invasion, Cimon's leadership was sought.

Cimon, a skilled leader, achieved victories against the Spartans and Persians. His triumphs led to a truce with the Spartans and success against the Persians. However, Cimon passed away from war wounds. His death was kept secret to ease the transition to a new leader. Meanwhile, Pericles managed Athenian affairs, advocating for the completion of city walls and the construction of Long Walls connecting the city to the seaport of Piraeus. Despite peace efforts, war resumed with Sparta, resulting in Athenian dominance. Pericles focused on enhancing Athens, overseeing the construction of the Parthenon temple and supporting artists like Phidias. Anaxagoras, Pericles' philosopher friend, faced exile for challenging traditional beliefs about celestial bodies.|"['1.

Anaxagoras, a wise man, quietly left Athens for a distant city to continue his studies. Pericles, a great leader, missed his friend and supported him financially. Another friend of Pericles was Aspasia, known for her intelligence and hosting gatherings of prominent Athenians. During the Peloponnesian War, Pericles advised the Athenians to seek refuge within the city walls while the navy fought at sea. The war lasted almost 30 years. Pericles understood eclipses and used this knowledge to calm his troops during a solar eclipse. The superstitious Spartans were frightened by the natural event, allowing Pericles to lead successful military campaigns. Pericles honored fallen soldiers with moving funeral speeches.|['1.

During the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians faced a terrible plague that spread rapidly within the city walls. Thousands suffered from the disease, tormented by a burning thirst and left to care for themselves as the sick perished. Hippocrates, a noble doctor, received a message from the King of Persia asking for help with the same disease but chose to aid his fellow Athenians first. Despite the loss of many lives, Hippocrates' care and skill saved numerous sufferers, earning him a golden crown and the title of an Athenian citizen. Meanwhile, the death of Pericles, a respected leader, left a void in Athens. Nicias, his successor, though honest, was criticized for his indecisiveness compared to the revered Pericles. Amidst the war, the philosopher Socrates focused on teaching and contemplating life's mysteries, seeking the truth about existence and the soul's fate beyond death.|"['1.

Socrates, a humble stonecutter, dedicated his spare time to pondering life's mysteries and questioning the beliefs of his fellow citizens. He grew to believe in a single, just, and powerful God who rewarded the virtuous and punished the wicked. Socrates upheld the values of forgiveness and gentleness, a departure from the common belief of seeking revenge. Despite having a difficult wife, Xanthippe, who constantly berated him, Socrates remained calm and never retaliated. He shared his wisdom with students in informal settings like his workshop or the Academy's gardens. Notable students included Plato, Xenophon, and Alcibiades. Alcibiades, a headstrong and wealthy young man, found guidance and humility in Socrates' teachings, though his tendency to seek approval often led him astray.|"['1.

In the midst of a battle, Alcibiades, a brave youth, found himself in danger due to his ornate but weak armor. His fair-weather friends abandoned him, but the philosopher Socrates came to his aid. Socrates rescued Alcibiades, bound his wounds, and earned his gratitude and friendship. Alcibiades, popular for his looks and wealth, enjoyed the attention of the Athenians. He even used his dog's tail-cutting as a ploy to keep the gossip alive. Despite his mischievous demeanor, Alcibiades was influential, even diverting a serious council meeting to a banquet at his home.

The Sybarites, known for their love of luxury, once went to great lengths for comfort, like a man who couldn't sleep on a rose petal-strewn couch. Their excessive indulgence led to their downfall when they clashed with Croton and were defeated. Alcibiades, a popular Athenian, suggested conquering rich colonies like Croton and Messina. Despite opposition, a fleet was readied. Before departure, statues of Hermes were found broken, blamed on Alcibiades. He left for Sicily, but enemies accused him of sacrilege. Alcibiades fled to Sparta, where he revealed Athenian plans, aiding in defeating them. The Spartans, following his lead, fortified Decelea near Athens, causing unrest.

The army, eager for action but lacking a leader, turned to Alcibiades for help. Despite his past mistakes, Alcibiades, known for his generosity and kind nature, agreed to assist. He tried to make amends by persuading the Persians to ally with the Athenians against the Spartans. However, his efforts were in vain as the Athenians suffered a devastating defeat. Fearing the consequences, Alcibiades fled and took refuge in a castle overlooking the sea. From there, he witnessed the destruction of the Athenian fleet by the Spartans. Despite warning the Athenians of the impending danger, they dismissed him. The victorious Spartans imposed harsh rule, known as the Thirty Tyrants, leading to chaos and suffering in Athens. Eventually, the Athenians, led by patriot Thras-y-bu´lus, rose against the tyrants and regained their freedom.|['1.

Years later, the Athenians rebuilt the Long Walls that Ly-san´der, the Spartan general, had destroyed amid celebrations. They honored Thrasybulus, their savior, with statues and songs at public events. Meanwhile, the Spartans, filled with pride after defeating the Athenians, grew conceited, which was harmful. Lysander captured Athens and other towns, sending the riches to Sparta. The ephors hesitated to accept the gold, fearing the love of wealth's evils. Eventually, they used it to enhance their city. Lysander, a noble man and general, returned poor, and Sparta covered his funeral costs. Grateful, they provided for his daughters. Socrates, highly esteemed for wisdom, was humble and open to learning. Aristophanes, a witty playwright, amusingly ridiculed figures like Socrates and Alcibiades, causing laughter and controversy among the Athenians.|"['1.

Socrates faced false accusations from his enemies, leading to his arrest and trial. Despite his innocence, he calmly defended himself, stating he never mocked the gods. He believed in a higher deity and taught virtue to young men. His friends urged him to defend himself eloquently, but he chose to accept his fate. The law allowed a reprieve during a month when offerings were made to Apollo, delaying his execution. Even in prison, Socrates refused escape, abiding by the law. As the time for his death approached, he maintained his principles. Socrates' disciple, Plato, recorded his final moments. He died by drinking poison, showing his unwavering commitment to his beliefs. His death was mourned by Athenians, who later honored him with a statue.|"['1.

After a challenging battle at Cu-nax´a where Cyrus was killed, the Greeks found themselves in a dire situation. Surrounded by enemies in a foreign land, leaderless and lacking supplies, they faced uncertainty and despair. Xenophon, a pupil of Socrates, emerged as a beacon of hope. He proposed a plan to lead the army safely back to Greece. Elected as their leader, Xenophon emphasized unity and obedience among the soldiers. Despite harsh conditions, the army marched homeward under his guidance, overcoming obstacles and skirmishes with the pursuing Persians.

As the Greeks journeyed through rugged mountain passes, they faced obstacles from local tribes rolling trees and rocks to impede them. Despite injuries and casualties, the army persisted, covering about a thousand miles until reaching the sea. Instead of sailing home, they walked along the shore, growing weary and disheartened. Straying from their promise to Xenophon, they seized towns for funds, but then decided to aid a new cause in freeing Ionian cities from Persian rule. Xenophon led them to Pergamus, handing them over to a new leader. Proud of their survival, he chronicled their journey in the Anabasis. Meanwhile, Spartan King Agesilaus, though small and lame, led his troops to Asia Minor to aid Greek cities against Artaxerxes. Despite being outnumbered, Agesilaus secured victories, impressing even his enemies with his humility and strategic prowess.|['1.

During a time of conflict in ancient Greece, the Spartans, led by Agesilaus, faced opposition from the Athenians and Thebans. The Athenians allied with the Persians to strengthen their defenses against the Spartans. The Greeks were divided, with some supporting the Athenians and others the Spartans. Amidst the chaos, jealousy and political maneuvering were rampant. A Spartan named Antalcidas, envious of Agesilaus' popularity, sought peace and made a treaty with the Persians. This treaty, known as the Treaty of Antalcidas, resulted in the surrender of Greek cities to the Persian king, weakening Sparta's power. Despite the treaty's provision for Greek cities' freedom, the Spartans maintained control over the Messenians. In a daring move, the Spartans surprised the Thebans during a festival, leading to their surrender without a fight. Amidst these events, two Theban exiles, Pelopidas and Epaminondas, plotted to overthrow the Spartans and restore freedom to Thebes.|"['1.

Pelopidas and his friends feared their plans were discovered, but Charon, the soldier, gave his son to Pelopidas, saying to avenge by killing his child if he betrayed them. The Theban exiles entered a Spartan banquet hall, where drunken officers were killed by the disguised exiles. The Spartans fled, thinking they faced a large army. The Spartans, ashamed of their defeat by twelve men, executed their officers. The Thebans made preparations to fight the Spartans, appointing Epaminondas as general and Pelopidas in charge of the Sacred Battalion. The Thebans and Spartans clashed at Leuctra, where the Thebans, led by Epaminondas, won. The Thebans erected a trophy to celebrate their victory.

When Alexander, the ruler, learned that Epaminondas led the troops, he feared and freed Pelopidas to appease the Thebans. Despite reuniting with Pelopidas, Epaminondas continued to march north to rid the land of the cruel Alexander. Meanwhile, the Spartans, breaking their vow, rebelled against Thebes. Epaminondas swiftly moved south to quell the uprising, leaving Pelopidas in Thessaly. Pelopidas valiantly battled the Thessalians but tragically perished. Undeterred, the Thebans pursued and vanquished Alexander, displaying contempt by desecrating his remains.

When the noble Philoxenus dared to speak the truth about Dionysius' work, the tyrant imprisoned him. 

Later, when a friend of Philoxenus, Pythias, faced death, another friend, Damon, selflessly offered to take his place in prison.

During ancient times in Greece, Dion, a leader, faced betrayal from Heraclides, a courtier. Dionysius, besieged in a citadel, was starving due to a blockade by the Syracusans. Desperate, Dionysius tricked Dion into thinking he was offering him the rule of Syracuse in exchange for freedom. This deceit caused Dion's followers to turn against him, allowing Heraclides to take power. However, the people soon regretted their decision and begged for Dion's forgiveness. After Dionysius returned and ruled harshly, the people rose against him, banishing him to Corinth. There, he struggled as a teacher, met with ridicule, and faced further downfall.

Philip was a wise king who not only trained his army but also mined gold in his kingdom, making him very wealthy. This wealth helped him hire soldiers and gain allies. Philip believed gold was even more powerful than his army, saying a fortress could be taken with a mule loaded with gold. He was loved by his subjects for being kind and just, always listening to their complaints. Once, after drinking too much, he made a wrong judgment but corrected it the next day. Philip was patient and forgiving, even towards those who spoke ill of him. He planned to conquer unruly neighbors but faced betrayal from an archer, Aster, who shot his left eye. Despite this, Philip kept his promise and hanged Aster when he took the city. The Athenians debated helping Philip's enemies, led by the insightful orator Demosthenes, who warned against Philip's ambitions in Greece.|"['1.

In the previous chapter, we learned about the conflict between Philip and Demosthenes in Greece. Demosthenes, an Athenian orator, was wary of Philip's ambitions and urged the Athenians to act against him. Despite Demosthenes' efforts, Philip conquered Olynthus and its union, erasing them from the map. Demosthenes, known for his powerful speeches, continued to speak out against Philip, even after receiving a golden cup as a gift. Demosthenes, an orphan with a speech impediment, overcame his challenges by practicing recitation near the seashore. He dedicated himself to learning and speaking eloquently, earning admiration from the Athenians.

The faithful Greeks battled the Phocians for an extended period but were unsuccessful in defeating them. Philip offered his assistance to the council. Eager to triumph, the Greeks welcomed his army into their land, and he swiftly subdued the rebels. After the conflict, Philip returned to Macedon. However, he was biding his time to reenter Greece and punish the Athenians for heeding Demosthenes' anti-Philip speeches. Meanwhile, Philip used his wealth to buy allies, with some gifts swaying opinion in his favor. Demosthenes' efforts to rally the Athenians against Philip culminated in a fierce clash at Chæronea, where the Macedonians emerged victorious. Alexander, Philip's son, played a crucial role in defeating the Thebans. This triumph established Philip's dominance over Greece, setting the stage for his ambitious plans to conquer Asia and overthrow the Persian Empire.|"['1.

Alexander greatly admired the poems he carried with him everywhere, even sleeping with them under his pillow. He kept the Iliad and the Odyssey in a box made of the finest gold. At the age of thirteen, he saw a beautiful horse named Bucephalus, which was difficult to handle. When everyone failed to tame the horse, Alexander stepped up. He calmed Bucephalus by facing him away from his shadow and then mounted him with ease. His father, Philip, impressed by Alexander's courage, gifted him the horse. Bucephalus became Alexander's favorite. Despite starting philosophy studies early under Aristotle, whom he deeply respected, Alexander did not always follow his advice. He became king at twenty after Philip's death, inheriting a vast army and wealth. The Athenians also rejoiced at Philip's death, hoping for freedom.|"['1.

Alexander's triumph surprised his citizens as they underestimated his capabilities. After three months of silence, the Greeks assumed Alexander had perished. The Thebans, seizing the opportunity, rebelled against Macedonian rule. However, Alexander swiftly defeated the Thracians and captured Thebes, sparing only the home of the poet Pindar. Witnessing the destruction of Thebes, other Greek cities pledged allegiance to Alexander, offering men, money, and supplies for his Asian campaign. Alexander then ventured to Corinth. Meanwhile, the eccentric philosopher Diogenes lived humbly in a tub, seeking an honest man with a lantern. When Alexander visited him, Diogenes rudely asked him to move out of his sunlight. Despite the philosopher's behavior, Alexander admired him, saying he would want to be Diogenes if not a king. Both Alexander and Diogenes met their ends on the same night, one in luxury and the other in simplicity. Alexander, with a small but disciplined army, set his sights on conquering Persia.|"[""1.

Alexander, the great conqueror, departed joyfully, generously gifting his companions until an advisor reminded him of his finite wealth. Landing where the proud city once stood, he honored Achilles and Patroclus. Soon, he faced the Persian army near the Granicus River, where a fierce battle ensued. Clytus saved Alexander from death in the fight. Despite the Persian army's size, Alexander triumphed. He refused tribute from Sardis and Ephesus, urging them to rebuild the Temple of Diana. In Caria, the queen welcomed him warmly, offering her best cooks. Alexander humorously described his simple meal preferences. He continued his conquest, solving the Gordian knot with a sword. A bath in the Cydnus River led to illness, but his physician, Philip, saved him with a potent medicine.|['Question 1: What did Alexander do when he departed?\nA) He mourned silently\nB) He gifted his companions generously\nC) He scolded his advisor\nD) He ignored his companions\nE) He left without saying goodbye', 'Question 2: Where did Alexander honor Achilles and Patroclus?\nA) Granicus River\nB) Sardis\nC) Ephesus\nD) Caria\nE) Cydnus River', 'Question 3: Who saved Alexander from death in the battle near the Granicus River?\nA) Achilles\nB) Patroclus\nC) Philip\nD) Clytus\nE) Diana', 'Question 4: What did Alexander refuse from Sardis and Ephesus?\nA) Tribute\nB) Food\nC) Weapons\nD) Horses\nE) Gold', 'Question 5: What did Alexander urge Sardis and Ephesus to do?\nA) Join the Persian army\nB) Leave their cities\nC) Rebuild the Temple of Diana\nD) Surrender to him\nE) Pay him with gold', 'Question 6: How did Alexander solve the Gordian knot?\nA) With a sword\nB) With fire\nC) With water\nD) With a hammer\nE) With magic']|['B) He gifted his companions generously', 'A) Granicus River', 'D) Clytus', 'A) Tribute', 'C) Rebuild the Temple of Diana', 'A) With a sword']
When the doctor was accused, he turned pale but was reassured by Alexander, who handed back the cup. Alexander trusted his doctor, and the medicine cured him, allowing him to continue his conquests. Alexander's army narrowly missed encountering the enemy and he hurried back to find them. After the battle, he visited the Persian royal ladies, accompanied by his friend Hephæstion. The queen mother mistook Hephæstion for the king and begged for mercy, but Alexander kindly reassured her. Although Alexander offered to teach the ladies to spin and weave, they declined, considering it beneath them. Alexander showed them kindness and respect, and they grew to love him. Alexander then marched southward, capturing cities along the coast before facing the difficult task of taking Tyre, which he eventually conquered.|"['1.

Walking with the old Jaddua, Alexander entered the sacred city of Jerusalem and the temple courts. There, he made an offering to the Lord and read prophecies about his conquests in the Books of Daniel and Zechariah. After a brief stay in Jerusalem, Alexander headed to Egypt, which he swiftly conquered. He established a city at the mouth of the Nile called Alexandria. The journey to a temple in Libya through the African desert was harsh. The soldiers struggled in the scorching sun, and horses suffered. Only camels could traverse the desert comfortably due to their unique water storage ability. Alexander finally reached the oasis with the Temple of Jupiter after enduring hardships. He then continued his conquest, crossing rivers and winning battles, including at the plains of Arbela. Alexander's compassionate actions towards the Babylonians and Jews earned their favor. He also sent a statue back to the Athenians and showed kindness to the Persian queen before her passing.|"[""1.

The youthful conqueror's victories had filled him with pride, leading him to decline a proposal, claiming the world couldn't have two masters. Alexander adopted the opulent lifestyle of an Eastern monarch, reveling in luxury and excess, forsaking the teachings of Aristotle. His reckless behavior, fueled by excessive drinking, culminated in the destruction of Persepolis. Despite refusing peace offers, Alexander pursued Darius, only to find him fatally wounded by Bessus. In a fit of rage, Alexander executed Bessus cruelly. Upon Darius' death, Alexander ensured a proper burial, earning the gratitude of Darius' family. Alexander's arrogance grew, leading to the unjust execution of Parmenio. His descent into tyranny was marked by excessive banquets and violence, including the tragic killing of Clytus. Alexander's conquests extended into India, where he faced King Porus in a fierce battle. Despite victories, his soldiers' refusal to advance beyond the Hyphasis River marked the end of his conquests.|"[""1.

Alexander, a great conqueror, faced challenges on his journey back from his conquests. He built a fleet to sail down the Indus River to the sea. With limited geography knowledge, he mistook the sea for the Euphrates. To explore, he sent his admiral, Nearchus, along the coast while leading his army on a tough journey. The soldiers endured hardships, including traversing burning sands. Alexander shared their struggles, displaying great leadership. After months of travel, the army reunited with the fleet at the Euphrates mouth. Nearchus' sea journey opened new trade routes. Alexander returned to Babylon, married a Persian princess, and honored his friend's memory. Despite his successes, Alexander's health declined due to excess. As he neared death, he passed his ring to Perdiccas, hinting at his successor. His death saddened many, marking the end of an era.|"['1.

After Alexander the Great passed away, his body was placed in a splendid coffin and taken to Alexandria, the city he established. There, a grand tomb was constructed by Ptolemy, one of Alexander's generals, who believed the deceased king should be worshipped as a god. The day following Alexander's demise, a somber gathering occurred in the palace. The Macedonian leaders sat silently, staring at the vacant golden throne, now adorned with the royal signet ring. The question arose: who would succeed the king known for his military brilliance and vast conquests? Although Alexander had a half-brother named Arridaeus and an infant son, the generals decided to appoint Arridaeus and the child as heirs. The kingdom was divided into thirty-three provinces, each overseen by a Macedonian officer in the name of Arridaeus and the young prince.|"[""1.

After a brief wait, one man approached the orator, but the response was silence. Curious, he pulled back the cloak, revealing a pale face signaling imminent death. The men hurriedly removed him from the temple to avoid defilement, discovering a hollow reed used to ingest a lethal poison. Demosthenes, choosing death over imprisonment, had taken his own life. The Athenians regretted not heeding Phocion's warnings and placed him in charge. Phocion, though honest, was deemed too cautious, eventually leading to cowardice. Learning that Perdiccas planned to crown the infant Alexander, Phocion realized the danger and sided with Cassander. However, Perdiccas faced enemies and met his demise during a battle in Egypt. Subsequently, Athens saw internal strife with Polysperchon accusing Phocion and others of betrayal. Forced to drink hemlock, Phocion's noble end marked the decline of Athenian power.|"['1.

"Demetrius, a skilled general, triumphed over Cassander at Thermopylæ, earning the title ""The Preserver"" upon his return to Athens. The people revered him, even naming a month after him. Demetrius later defeated Ptolemy, becoming King of Syria. As tensions rose among the generals, war erupted. Demetrius aimed to capture Rhodes but failed after a year-long siege.

Demetrius, angered by the Athenians, laid siege to their city. The Athenians, fearing punishment, resisted during the months-long siege. When Demetrius entered the city, the citizens were terrified. He gathered them in the public square, surrounded by soldiers with unsheathed swords. Though he scolded them for ingratitude, he showed mercy by providing grain to feed their families. The citizens, initially terrified, rejoiced at his kindness. Despite his generosity, Demetrius met a tragic end at the hands of Seleucus. The Greeks, recalling past victories, united to defeat the Gauls under Bren´nus, who took their own lives in despair.

Achæan League, led by Agis, achieved significant victories, prompting other towns in the Peloponnesus to join. The league's strength grew, with most towns freed from tyrants. The Romans sought the league's aid to combat pirates. The league, unaware of Rome's future power, agreed to help. Meanwhile, Sparta, under King Leonidas, had strayed from its noble past due to greed and laziness. Agis, another Spartan king, aimed to restore Sparta's former glory by promoting equality. Leonidas resisted the plan, leading to his deposition and Cleombrotus becoming king. Agis, a skilled general, defeated the Ætolians, but faced internal strife upon his return.

The Ætolians emerged as defenders of freedom, defeating the Achæans. The Achæans sought help from the Macedonians, leading to the War of the Two Leagues. Initially following Aratus, the Macedonian king later poisoned him to assume leadership. Facing a strong alliance of Spartans and Ætolians, the Achæans and Macedonians sought aid from Rome. The Spartans, freed from the Achæan League, fell under the tyrant Nabis' rule. Nabis used a statue of his wife to extort wealth, resorting to torture if refused. Philopoemen, a brave general, freed Sparta from Nabis' cruelty. However, the Spartans later revolted against the Achæans, leading Philopoemen to take severe measures. Philopoemen foresaw Roman interference and tried to maintain peace, but the Romans incited conflict by bribing the Messenians. Ultimately, Philopoemen fell into a Roman trap, leading to his capture and humiliation.|"[""1.

For centuries, the Greeks gathered at Corinth every three years for the Isthmian games, honoring Poseidon. Here, like at Olympia, they competed in races, wrestling, boxing, and poetry, winning olive leaf crowns. In 196 B.C., Romans joined the celebration amid Greek joy over peace after the War of the Two Leagues. During the festivities, Roman consul Quin´tius Flam-i-ni´nus announced the victory over Macedon, declaring Greek freedom. However, this joy was short-lived as Romans annexed Greece. The Greeks, exiled and embittered, revolted against the Achæans. Æ-mil´i-us Pau´lus, conqueror of Macedon, marched through Greece, sacking Corinth and taking its art treasures. This marked the end of ancient Greece, a country influential in art, philosophy, and literature.|"['1. What were the main events of the Isthmian games in Corinth?\nA.
