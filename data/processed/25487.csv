Oh, that's okay. They come here because you trust them, but you can make up for what you lose by charging it to others. Pa will be upset with you at the end of the week. He has been reviewing your bill, comparing it with the hired girl's, and she says we haven't had prunes, dried apples, raisins, cinnamon, or crackers and cheese from your store. Pa thinks you're worse than the James Brothers, and he even compares you to a three-card monte man. He's threatening to have you arrested for highway robbery, but you can settle that with Pa. I like you because you're not an ordinary thief; you're a sophisticated kind of swindler who wouldn't take anything you couldn't carry. Don't worry, it's good to hear the truth from someone with the courage to speak it.|"['1.
