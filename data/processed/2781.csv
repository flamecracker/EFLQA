From the starfish to the garfish, the crab to the dab, and even the plaice, dace, skate, mackereel, pickereel, and the twirly-whirly eel. The Whale ate them all, leaving only one small fish, the ‘Stute Fish, swimming near his ear to stay safe. When the Whale felt hungry again, the ‘Stute Fish suggested trying the taste of a Man. Following the ‘Stute Fish's advice, the Whale found a shipwrecked Mariner at a specific location in the sea.

In the old days, the Leopard lived in the High Veldt, a place of sand and rock. The Leopard's sandy-yellow-brown fur matched the surroundings perfectly. He would hide and surprise other animals like the Giraffe and Zebra. The Giraffe, Zebra, and others eventually learned to avoid the Leopard. They fled to a forest full of shadows and grew darker to blend in. Meanwhile, the Leopard and an Ethiopian hunter got hungry and ate unusual things, giving them a big tummy ache. They met Baviaan, a wise Baboon, who puzzled them. They set off to find the original Flora and came across a speckled forest.

The Ethiopian and the Leopard were puzzled by their mismatched appearances. The Zebra and Giraffe had stripes and blotches that didn't blend with their surroundings. Realizing they needed to adapt, the Ethiopian decided to change his skin. He pressed his fingers on the Leopard, leaving five distinct spots. The Leopard transformed, now able to camouflage perfectly. The animals learned to blend in with their environments. This tale teaches us the importance of adapting to our surroundings.

In the ancient times, the Elephant lacked a trunk. Instead, it had a blackish, bulgy nose that wiggled from side to side but couldn't pick things up. An inquisitive young Elephant's Child in Africa bombarded his family with questions. He asked the Ostrich about her tail-feathers, the Giraffe about his spots, the Hippopotamus about her red eyes, and the Baboon about the taste of melons. Despite numerous spankings, the curious Elephant's Child persisted. One day, he set off to the Limpopo River to discover what the Crocodile ate. Unaware of the danger, he encountered the Crocodile and narrowly escaped being dragged into the river. The Elephant's Child's nose stretched as the Crocodile pulled, causing him great pain. With the help of the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, he managed to free himself from the Crocodile's grip.|"['1.

Once upon a time, the Elephant's Child got into trouble with a Crocodile. They tugged and pulled, but the Elephant's Child and the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake pulled the hardest. Finally, the Crocodile let go with a loud plop. The Elephant's Child thanked the snake, tended to his pulled nose, and cooled it with banana leaves in the Limpopo River. He waited for three days, hoping his nose would shrink, but it didn't. Instead, it turned into a trunk! The Elephant's Child joyfully discovered his new trunk could do amazing things. He could pluck fruit from trees, swat flies, and even sing through it. When he returned home, he playfully spanked his family with his trunk. They were astonished and quickly ran off to the Crocodile to get trunks of their own. And that's how all elephants got their trunks, just like the 'satiable Elephant's Child.|"[""1.

"Taffy and her Daddy were playing a game using sound pictures to predict the weather. When a raindrop fell on Taffy's hand, she realized it was going to rain. Excitedly, she danced around her Daddy, understanding the sound picture ""shu-ya"" meant rain. Taffy even suggested drawing the sound picture on the wall to warn others about the rain. Her Daddy then challenged her to figure out a sound picture for when it wouldn't rain much. The next morning, Taffy found a new sound picture drawn by the river, indicating water was running out.

"""Come, let's draw the leftover sound-pictures,"" said Taffy's Daddy. They had an exciting day, a lovely lunch, and played games. For the letter T, they drew a family group holding hands because their names started with T. Drawing it repeatedly made it scratchier until it was just Tegumai with outstretched arms. They drew various sound-pictures like a hissy-snake for Z, a twiddle for E, and noses for N. They even drew a picture of a pike's mouth for the Ga-sound. After many years and different scripts, the Alphabet A, B, C, D, E, etc., returned. In the beginning, the Eldest Magician prepared the Earth, Sea, and told animals to play.

Once upon a time, the Eldest Magician addressed the creatures of the land, sea, and air, questioning who was playing with the Sea. The Moon appeared, and the Magician called out to the Fisher of the Moon, asking if he was the one playing with the Sea. The Magician's daughter then spoke up, recalling a beast that had mischievously ventured into the Sea before learning its play. The Magician, with a magical gesture, transformed the mighty King Crab, Pau Amma, into a soft creature. Pau Amma worried about his vulnerability and inability to feed if he left his safe place. The Magician offered to make the entire sea a safe haven for Pau Amma and his offspring. However, Pau Amma hesitated, wanting to know what the Man who had distracted the Magician at the Very Beginning would do for him.|['1.

Once upon a time, the Eldest Magician made a special offer to Pau Amma, a crab, to have the ability to roam both the land and sea. However, Pau Amma hesitated, worried about the consequences. The little girl-daughter then intervened, offering Pau Amma a pair of sharp scissors to crack nuts, climb trees, and create safe hiding spots. The Eldest Magician agreed but reminded Pau Amma that once a year, the scissors would turn soft as a lesson in humility. Pau Amma accepted the offer and transformed into a tiny crab with newfound abilities. The Eldest Magician then taught a lazy man a lesson by having the Moon Fisherman pull his canoe back home effortlessly. This act resulted in the Malazy people, known for their laziness.|"['1.

Long ago, the Moon's pull on the sea created tides, controlled by the Fisher of the Sea and the Eldest Magician. Pau Amma's babies, the crabs, thrive near the sea, building homes under stones. They must shed their shells yearly to remember the Magician's power. Ships like P's and O's pass by Pau Amma's playground, while others like U.C.S. avoid it. The tale unfolds in a wild world where even the Dog, Horse, Cow, Sheep, and Pig were wild until the Woman tamed the Man. Together, they enjoyed a feast of wild treats. The Woman's magic with a bone created the First Singing Magic, bringing harmony to their home.|"[""1.

Wild Dog and Cat had a disagreement, but the Woman in the Cave welcomed Wild Dog with delicious roast mutton. The Woman then created a magic spell, making Wild Dog the First Friend.

Once upon a time, a clever Cat roamed the Wet Wild Woods. He struck a deal with a Woman in a Cave to stay inside. The Cat entertained the Woman's Baby and won her praise. The Cat sang the Baby to sleep and warmed himself by the fire. Each time the Woman praised him, the Cat gained more privileges. But the Woman grew wary and cast a Still Magic to prevent herself from praising the Cat again. However, a little mouse disrupted the silence, causing the Milk-pot to break, allowing the Cat to lap up warm white milk.

Once upon a time, in a cave, a Cat, a Dog, and a Man made a unique bargain. The Man challenged the Cat to catch mice forever, or face being pelted with his boots and axe. The Dog joined in, demanding kindness towards the Baby or be hunted and bitten. The Cat agreed but asserted its independence. As the Man and Dog threatened, the Cat fled up a tree. From then on, three out of five Men throw things at Cats, and Dogs chase them up trees. Despite this, the Cat stays true to its word, helping with mice and Babies indoors but roaming freely outdoors.

Suleiman-bin-Daoud was a wise king who possessed a magical ring that could summon powerful beings. With a turn of his ring, he could command Afrits, Djinns, and even angels. Despite his extraordinary powers, Suleiman-bin-Daoud remained humble and rarely used his abilities to show off. Once, he attempted to feed all the animals in the world, but a sea creature devoured the food meant for them. This incident humbled the king, teaching him a valuable lesson about humility. Suleiman-bin-Daoud also had nine-hundred and ninety-nine wives, but only Balkis the Most Beautiful truly understood and supported him.

Suleiman-bin-Daoud overheard a conversation between two creatures, one boasting that he could make the palace vanish with a stamp. Suleiman laughed and beckoned the creature, a Butterfly, who was terrified but perched on his hand. The Butterfly admitted his fib to his wife, who was also summoned by Balkis the Queen. The Butterfly's Wife shared that men often boast without meaning it. Balkis advised her to challenge her husband next time. The Butterfly returned, worried that his wife now doubted his words.
