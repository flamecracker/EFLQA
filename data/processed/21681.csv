General Beauregard was faced with a difficult decision. Despite feeling disgraced and knowing he might be cashiered, he chose not to betray the woman he loved. As he grappled with his emotions, a high-pitched voice interrupted the tense moment. Fanny Glen, bareheaded and breathless, pushed through the group to confront the general and Sempland.

At once, the ship's chain cable was released, bells rang deep within the vessel, engines roared to life, and the propellers spun, slowly moving the ship backward. Despite the efforts, it was too late. The enemy vessel, like a sea devil, was too close to escape. The crew of the _David_ worked tirelessly, propelling the torpedo boat towards the doomed ship. Lacy managed a quick glance upwards before chaos ensued. The enemy ship's deck was crowded with men, flashes of light and bullets filled the air. A jet of water hit Lacy's face, followed by a deafening explosion as the torpedo struck the ship, creating a massive hole below the waterline. Cheers erupted from the _David_ as darkness enveloped them. On the frigate, panic ensued as men scrambled on deck, some trapped below, others killed by the blast. Despite the chaos, officers managed to restore order, directing surviving men to the rigging for safety. The sinking ship was a scene of turmoil, with exploding boilers and escaping steam adding to the chaos. Some crew members stayed on deck, armed and hopeful for revenge, but the torpedo boat had vanished. Rescue efforts were initiated by nearby vessels, but the torpedo boat remained elusive. The fleet maintained their positions, thwarting blockade-runners attempting to take advantage of the chaos.
