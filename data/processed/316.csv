"""I would ride to the world's end with you, Kenneth MacNair,"" declared Ursula. Back then, people had no etiquette rules, Felicity. The Fair Lady sailed out of Charlottetown harbor at dawn with Kenneth and Ursula MacNair on deck, the bride holding a ball of gray homespun yarn.

Felicity and her mother prepared eagerly, excluding Cecily and the Story Girl. Cecily felt left out and complained about Felicity's airs about her cooking. Parcels from distant friends were kept unopened until Christmas. The last week dragged by until Christmas day arrived, with Uncle Roger, Aunt Olivia, and the Story Girl joining for a day of revelry despite the frost outside.

"Last night, I read a beautiful story from Aunt Olivia's book called ""The Christmas Harp."" It's about a shepherd who loved music but struggled to express the melodies in his soul.

We watched as a tall, gray-haired lady, Great-aunt Eliza, approached the house with a slightly puzzled look. Her unexpected visit had us scurrying to tidy up the kitchen. Cecily reminded us to be kind as Great-aunt Eliza had faced much loneliness and buried three husbands. Despite our reluctance, we hurried to make her stay pleasant. As she entered, Felicity, in a flurry, directed us to straighten up quickly. Great-aunt Eliza, although imposing, greeted us warmly, and we introduced ourselves. Cecily noted that one doesn't have to be very old to be a great-aunt, sharing a tidbit about a friend's great-aunt.

Felicity sternly refused to trust Aunt Eliza with the rusks, fearing she might gossip. Cecily bravely tried to engage with the elderly lady, despite her deafness. Dan teased from behind, causing laughter among the group. While Cecily shared family photos, Great-aunt Eliza remained silent but smiled occasionally.

Dan shared amusing anecdotes about the Rev. Lemuel and Uncle Roger. The group's laughter caught the attention of Great-aunt Eliza.

During supper, Great-aunt Eliza quickly said grace and enjoyed the delicious meal Felicity had prepared. She particularly liked the rusks and even had three, praising their taste. Initially, there was a silent and awkward atmosphere, but as the meal progressed, the Story Girl shared a tragic story about Charlottetown. Felicity mentioned that the story might not be true, suggesting the governor's wife died of indigestion instead of a broken heart. She also revealed that the current governor's wife, Agnes Clark, was once in love with Great-aunt Eliza's father, but they never married. Despite some light-hearted banter about the governor's appearance, a mysterious sound in Great-aunt Eliza's voice made everyone uncomfortable, leading to a quiet end to the meal.|"['1.

After the gathering with Great-aunt Eliza, the family realized it wasn't her but Mrs. Governor Lesley who had visited. Cecily felt guilty for mistaking her and speaking ill.

On a chilly March Saturday, we set off on a long-awaited visit to Cousin Mattie Dilke in Baywater. Although the trip was not anticipated with much excitement as Cousin Mattie's place was usually devoid of youthful vigor, we knew it was necessary to keep her happy. Despite the gray skies hinting at an impending storm, we embarked on the journey. Along the way, we shared laughter, stories, and the warmth of friendship. The frozen landscape thawed under our feet as we traversed hills, fields, and woods. Despite the eerie stillness of the woods and the whispers of an approaching storm, we found solace in each other's company. As we approached Baywater, we hoped to avoid a mysterious figure named Peg Bowen, who had unsettled us since a peculiar incident involving bewitchment.

Dan expressed his fondness for Cousin Mattie's late husband, who was always kind and carried treats in his pockets. Dan preferred visiting when he was alive, finding older women less appealing. He shared a tale about Cousin Ebenezer's aversion to borrowing, recalling a time when he nervously asked for an axe in secret. Despite the humorous incident, Cecily missed the joke. The group enjoyed a pleasant dinner at Cousin Mattie's, where they received treats and kindness. As they left early to avoid a storm, they got caught in a blinding snowstorm on their way home. Struggling to find their way back, they faced the bitter cold and howling winds, growing more fearful with each step in the white desolation of the storm.|"[""1.

We all gathered together in fear as the snowstorm raged on. Cecily started crying from the cold, but Dan selflessly gave her his overcoat. Doubt filled my mind about surviving the night. The darkness and deepening snow chilled us to the bone. Despite the girls' fatigue, we pressed on through the storm, desperate to find our way home. Just as hope seemed lost, Felix spotted a light ahead. Following him, we discovered Peg Bowen's house. She welcomed us warmly, helping us shake off the snow and offering us comfort by the stove. Grateful for her kindness, we settled in, safe from the storm.|"['1.

Peg hurried off to collect a strange mix of chairs, some missing backs and rungs. Soon, we sat in a circle around her warm stove, drying off. It was surreal to find ourselves as guests by the witch's fire, with Peg brewing ginger tea for Cecily, who shivered despite the heat. Sis sipped the tea obediently, too intimidated by Peg to refuse. The room was cluttered with pictures, cats, a three-legged dog, a crow, and even a skull. As Peg served a questionable meal, we ate without complaint, not wanting to upset her. Peg, with a sly grin, commented on our appearances and shared tidbits about our families.

"""Well, that's better than being the color of mud,"" whispered Peter, defending his lady against the witch's words. Felicity shot him a look, but Peg, unfazed, turned to Cecily. ""Bless you, I don't mind him,"" Peg said, always expecting the unexpected. ""I like a lad of spirit. And so your father ran away, did he, Peter? He used to be a beau of mine. Some folks said he did it for a dare. There's such jealousy in the world, ain't there? Do you know where he is now?"" As she pulled out her pipe, Peg invited them to make themselves at home.

"Peg's voice suddenly grew louder, almost turning into a shriek. We were all scared because we knew sometimes she acted strangely, and we were afraid she might have one of her episodes. Quickly, she pulled the man's coat she was wearing over her head, covering her face completely. She then crouched down, resting her elbows on her knees, and fell silent. None of us dared to move or speak. We sat like that for about thirty minutes. Eventually, Peg stood up and cheerfully said, ""I think you're all tired and ready for bed. Girls, you can sleep in my bed, and I'll take the sofa. Boys, you can sleep downstairs on the straw. I'll light the way for you but won't leave a light in case of a fire."" After saying goodnight, we all settled in for the night. The storm had passed by morning, leaving a beautiful snowy landscape outside Peg's cabin.

Peg declined our offer with pride, stating she doesn't associate with those who expect payment for hospitality. After a tense departure, we discussed our experience.

I must share my worst adventure from two years ago. While sledding on Uncle Roger's hill, chaos ensued. Charlie and Fred's sled got stuck, so I rushed to help.

The evening was lovely, with cool air after a hot day. The wheat fields around us were ready for harvest. The wind whispered through the grass, and the buttercups danced joyfully. Shadows moved over the fields, and bees hummed happily in the gardens. The Story Girl wished they could have the church service outside in the summer. Peter quoted Shakespeare and shared a funny story about a minister wearing a nightcap to church. At the graveyard, the Story Girl placed flowers on her mother's grave, while the others read the epitaph on Great-Grandfather King's tombstone, written by Great-Grandmother King. The epitaph was a cherished family tradition, etched on red sandstone, and it always held a special place in their hearts.|"['1.

"As we entered the church, only a few people were present. We settled into our seats in the traditional King pew. Suddenly, Felicity whispered in a flustered tone, ""Peg Bowen is here!"" All eyes turned to Peg, a rare sight in the usually solemn aisles of Carlisle church. She wore a short, worn skirt and a bright red calico waist, with flour dusted liberally on her face, arms, and feet. Peg's appearance that night was unforgettable.

In the bustling church, Peg pointed out familiar faces, like Melita Ross, known for her long-lasting bonnet.

"Peg, a spirited church-goer, had a unique way of expressing her thoughts, often out loud. She shared her candid observations with those around her, much to their surprise. Peg offered peppermints to distract herself from chatting, but she couldn't resist commenting on the congregation members passing by. She had colorful opinions about each person, from their pets to their personalities. When the minister began his sermon, Peg quieted down, only interjecting with a few hearty ""Amens.""

"Peg left the church in Carlisle, unimpressed by Mr. Davidson's sermon. Elder Bayley praised it, but the King household found no solace in it. Felicity felt humiliated by being associated with the sermon. In an orchard, children and Miss Reade gathered around a stone pulpit. The Story Girl arrived with a striking poppy, offering it to Miss Reade, who wore an unusual ring. The Story Girl promised to tell a tragic tale of the ""Yankee Storm,"" a devastating event from 1851. The storm wreaked havoc on American fishing schooners, with many vessels wrecked and lives lost.

Mr. Coles couldn't recall more of the tragic Yankee Storm stories, but the saddest tale was about the Franklin Dexter shipwreck. The ship ran aground at Markdale Capes, claiming the lives of all on board, including the Captain and his three brothers. Their father from Portland, Maine, came to the island to retrieve their bodies for burial back home. Despite their initial burial in Markdale graveyard, the father insisted on taking them back to Maine. They were placed on the Seth Hall ship, captained by Seth Hall himself, a profane man. Ignoring warnings of an impending storm, the captain set sail, leading to the ship's demise, leaving the old mother in Maine without closure. Cecily, embroidering an autograph quilt, sought Mr. Campbell's name, despite his aversion to missions, to match Kitty Marr's contributions.|"[""1.

That afternoon, we bravely ventured to Mr. Campbell's house. The path we chose was picturesque, leading us through fields and forests, offering a scenic journey. Despite our concerns about the meeting, the absence of the Story Girl, who had previously charmed Mr. Campbell, made us uneasy. Cecily, in a simple dress, worried about her attire, fearing Mr. Campbell's judgment. As we traversed hills and valleys, the beauty of Carlisle unfolded before us, bathed in golden sunlight. The path meandered through a fir forest, where a gentle breeze and a babbling brook enchanted us.

Cecily was anxious about discussing the Mission Band autograph quilt with Mr. Campbell. However, he provided a perfect opportunity for her to explain the project. She nervously shared the details, mentioning that each member of the Band would have a square on the quilt with embroidered names. The funds collected would support a girl in Korea. Mr. Campbell doubted the sincerity of the Band's efforts, challenging Cecily to attend church the next day in her current attire without explaining why.

When she caught sight of Jasper, the enchantment broke. Jasper, once shy and now crimson with embarrassment, remained kneeling in silence, appearing almost pitiful in his awkwardness. A faint smile played on her lips as she swiftly walked away. Jasper watched her depart, feeling a new, painful sense of longing and beauty. He realized the bittersweet feeling of her gaze on him. As he saw her leave, the ache of her absence grew stronger. He believed she might be the new music teacher, possibly named Alice. Later, when he discovered her name was indeed Alice, he felt no surprise. Placing mayflowers under a picture, the tribute lost its charm, as the true essence of her beauty eluded the painting. Jasper's dreams and the room felt empty without her presence. He observed her passing by every day, once with a child, a sight that had never been part of his daydreams. The vision of a future with her and a child stirred within him. Jasper, conflicted yet hopeful, left daffodils under the pine for her to find. Alice, upon discovering the flowers, knew they were from Jasper, feeling surprised and delighted. Despite Jasper's shyness, Alice found his uniqueness endearing, appreciating his beauty and differences. She saw him in a positive light, never finding him ridiculous.|"['1.

Hand in hand, we roamed through a magical place, searching for the creatures of fairyland. We heard their mysterious voices beckoning from the hills and knolls. Only when the fire dwindled to embers did we depart the grove. The full moon shone brightly in the cloudless sky over the valley.

One thrilling adventure I had was when I tumbled off Uncle Roger's loft two years back. The Story Girl and I were hunting for eggs in the loft, filled with slippery wheat straw. I took a step, and the straw gave way, sending me headfirst towards the ground. As I fell, time seemed to slow down. I had five thoughts in that short span: confusion, realization of falling, concern for the landing, acceptance of potential harm, and a strange calmness. Luckily, a pile of chaff cushioned my fall, sparing me any serious injury. Despite my initial fearlessness, the aftermath left me trembling. In another tale, a girl's egg theft led to a battle between birds and other creatures, ending in a surprising victory for the robins and their allies.|"[""Question 1: What was the main reason for the narrator's fall off the loft?\nA) The loft was slippery\nB) The narrator was pushed\nC) The narrator was hunting for eggs\nD) The straw gave way\nE) The narrator tripped over a rock"", 'Question 2: How many thoughts did the narrator have as they were falling off the loft?\nA) Two\nB) Three\nC) Four\nD) Five\nE) Six', ""Question 3: What was the narrator's initial reaction to falling off the loft?\nA) Fear\nB) Excitement\nC) Confusion\nD) Anger\nE) Disappointment"", 'Question 4: How did the narrator feel about the potential harm during the fall?\nA) Excited\nB) Worried\nC) Indifferent\nD) Accepting\nE) Angry', 'Question 5: What saved the narrator from serious injury during the fall?\nA) A pile of rocks\nB) A pile of chaff\nC) A safety net\nD) A mattress\nE) A trampoline', 'Question 6: How did the narrator feel after the fall?\nA) Excited\nB) Calm\nC) Fearful\nD) Confused\nE) Trembling']"|['D) The straw gave way', 'D) Five', 'C) Confusion', 'D) Accepting', 'B) A pile of chaff', 'E) Trembling']
"The little girl was captured by a witch and imprisoned in a dungeon full of snakes. She succumbed to their bites. Later, anyone passing through the forest would be seized by her ghost and thrown into the same dungeon. About a year later, the woods transformed into a golden castle, only leaving behind a tree fragment. Mr. Alan King is due back from South America next month, accompanied by his sons to Toronto. Beverley and Felix, popular in Carlisle, will be missed. Bangs are in trend, with Em Frewen sporting them after a visit to Summerside. Despite the departure of the Story Girl and Uncle Blair, they reminisced in the orchard, cherishing their time together. They laughed, read dream books, and toasted to eternal friendship around the well, avoiding the word ""goodbye"" to part on a positive note."|"['1.
