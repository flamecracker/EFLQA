"This project began many years ago when I delved into newspapers and journals from 1860-1865 at the British Museum to study English public opinion during the American Civil War. As a teacher at Stanford University in California, I further explored diplomatic correspondence between Great Britain and the United States. While collaborating on a biography of Charles Francis Adams, who served as the American Minister to Great Britain during the Civil War, our work was interrupted by the outbreak of the Great War. In 1920, I resumed my research on ""Great Britain and the American Civil War,"" hoping to access English materials collected by Mr. Adams. Despite restrictions on citing diplomatic archives beyond 1859, I obtained approval to use these materials for my historical work. Studying private papers like the Russell Papers and the Gladstone Papers in England has enriched my research."|"['1.

"None of the interactions between governments significantly impacted British policies towards America. The ""War of 1812,"" known as ""Mr. Madison's War"" in the United States and derisively named by Tory contemporaries in Great Britain, stemmed from serious conflicts where the governments were in clear opposition. It was essentially a clash between belligerent and neutral interests. Britain initially fought to preserve Europe from French revolutionary influence, later against Napoleon's Empire plan. The dispute with America revolved around blockades, contraband, and the British ""rule of 1756."" The core issue was the British practice of impressment, where they claimed once a person was born a British subject, they could never cease to be one. This led to a clash over citizenship rights and the right of search at sea. The War of 1812 also arose from conflicting maritime and naval interests between America and Britain."|"['1.

In American history, the War of 1812 is often seen as a second fight for independence and a crucial battle against Britain's unfair control of the seas. This war was significant as it was one of the few major conflicts the United States engaged in until the Mexican War of 1846. The British perspective, however, was that of a nation fighting a life-and-death struggle against a powerful European enemy. While some in Britain saw an opportunity to crush Napoleon's ambitions, the war was not primarily about the American democratic system for the British government. The peace treaty signed in 1814 at Ghent marked the end of the war, but tensions persisted. The issue of the right of search in times of peace remained a point of contention, with Britain using its navy to combat the African Slave Trade. This disagreement over the right of search continued to strain relations between the two nations, leading to further diplomatic challenges and misunderstandings.|"['1.

The dispute over the right of search ended when American power became a significant factor in global policy. American leaders had long envisioned separating the interests of the Western Hemisphere from Europe's. Washington warned against entangling alliances with Europe. Britain, facing French intervention in Spain and Spanish America, proposed a joint declaration with America against French involvement in the Americas. However, America, led by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and President Monroe, preferred a separate declaration. This led to the Monroe Doctrine, opposing European colonization in the Americas. The Doctrine allowed the US to expand its influence. The US population grew rapidly, and as it expanded westward, tensions arose with Britain over American territorial ambitions. The British, reliant on American cotton, were wary of US expansion, especially concerning Texas and slavery.|['1.

The fate of Texas was a pivotal point in British policy towards America. Pakenham, the British minister to Mexico, advocated for British pressure on Mexico to prevent the reconquest of Texas and to support Texas in maintaining its independence. The goal was to create a strong Anglo-Saxon state in Texas that would act as a buffer against American expansion to the southwest. Ultimately, the hope was to lead Texas to abolish slavery. Despite tensions, Britain aimed to avoid war with America. The British government's involvement in Texas's fate was met with mixed reactions in America, as it seemed to hinder American expansion. Texas eventually chose to join the United States in 1846 after a decade of independence. The British government's role in this episode was seen as unfavorable by many Americans.|"[""1.

In 1860, the tensions between the governments of the United States and Britain seemed to have eased. The issues of impressment and British expatriation theories had largely been resolved. The right of search in peacetime had been settled by Britain's renunciation in 1858. Disputes over American territorial expansion had subsided since the annexation of Texas. While minor conflicts in Central America were resolved amicably, deeper underlying differences persisted. Commercial ties between the two nations were vital. After gaining independence in 1783, America's commercial relationship with Britain changed. The British colonial system no longer favored American trade. Despite legal restrictions, trade between New England and the British West Indies resumed, although not as profitable as before. The War of 1812 disrupted direct trade with Britain, leading America to develop its own industries. The post-war period saw British merchants flooding the American market with cheap goods, aiming to hinder American manufacturing growth.|['1.

During the early 1800s, British merchants' actions upset American businesses, leading to a call for protection in the United States. The American government, mainly representing agriculture, passed a temporary Tariff Bill in 1816 to cover war expenses. British policy favored colonial expansion, focusing on British North America's maritime provinces and trade with the West Indies. This policy affected American trade, leading to a push for protectionism in the U.S. By 1820, the issue of West Indian trade became a major concern, resulting in political action. Congress retaliated by passing a law in 1818 to restrict British vessels from American ports. This sparked a change in American economic policies, culminating in the Tariff Bill of 1828. The U.S. embraced protectionism, contrasting Britain's move towards free trade. The clash of economic theories and interests between the two nations persisted until 1846 when Britain embraced free trade. Southern cotton interests in the U.S. opposed protectionism, leading to the 1854 reciprocity treaty with British American Provinces. Despite British disapproval of slavery, trade ties with the Southern States grew due to cotton exports and mutual economic interests.|['1.

Government policies and trade interests often shape historical narratives, but public opinion can also influence a nation's stance on international affairs. Before 1860, British views on America were mixed. While criticisms of American social customs were common due to a preference for British ways, there was a fascination with American political ideals and institutions. British emigration to America, especially by laborers seeking better wages and social equality, was fueled by stories of prosperity and democratic living. The British lower class saw America as a land of opportunity and personal happiness, shaping a positive image of the country. Travelers' accounts and emigrant guides highlighted America's political and economic appeal, portraying it as a republic with equal laws and abundant opportunities. This positive portrayal influenced British public opinion, especially among small farmers and merchants facing economic challenges at home.|"['1.

During the American colonial movement towards independence, British interest in American political principles emerged. Whigs sympathized with these principles due to political controversies at home, even after American independence. This sympathy faced opposition from Tory circles. By 1820, British Liberals started to push for a more representative government, influenced by American democracy. The Reform Bill of 1832 was a significant moment when British politics looked towards America for inspiration, while also criticizing its democratic system. Books, reviews, and newspapers in Great Britain depicted America favorably or unfavorably based on political sympathies at home. The debate centered around whether the American democratic model should influence British politics. The period from 1830 to 1840 saw a shift in British views on American democracy, with many emphasizing its dangers and shortcomings to dissuade further electoral reforms.|['1.

"After 1832, the British governing class shifted from sympathy to a critical view of America, viewing it as a rising nation impacting British prosperity and power. British travelers' books post-1840 focused on American industry and policy rather than political institutions. Buckingham, Combe, Sturge, Featherstonaugh, Kennedy, and Warburton, among others, described various aspects of America. Some were startled by its power, growth, and anti-British sentiment. The influx of Irish immigrants to America in 1848 further fueled anti-British feelings. Books reflecting America's power coincided with British opposition to its development. Mackay's ""Western World"" in 1849 praised American political institutions, resonating with the British public. The issue of slavery in America also drew British criticism, with Wilberforce's anti-slavery crusade influencing British sentiment."|"[""1.

From 1830 to 1850, British sentiment against slavery was strong. There was hope that the Northern States in the US would end slavery in the South. But with each crisis ending in compromise, British abolitionists lost hope. After the 1850 compromise, sympathy for the North decreased in Britain. The British government still fought against the African slave trade, but interest in slavery had waned. The London _Times_ criticized American slavery, especially in the South. Mrs. Stowe's _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ was more popular in England than in the US, partly due to English dislike for America. British intellectuals believed American slavery was too ingrained to be abolished. Despite interest in the issue, many in Britain felt efforts against American slavery were futile.|"['1.

In recent studies about British policy in Texas, much information has been shared. Books like _British Interests and Activities in Texas, 1838-1846_ and _British Diplomatic Correspondence concerning the Republic of Texas_ shed light on this topic. Moreover, works by authors like William Kennedy and George Warburton provide valuable insights into the Republic of Texas. Discussions in Parliament, as seen in the _Hansard_, reveal the historical context of diplomatic relations between the United States and Britain. Additionally, the British perspective on America, especially concerning slavery and political differences, played a significant role in shaping their views. When Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860, the British Government and people were taken aback by the impending civil conflict in America, highlighting a lack of understanding of the situation.|"['1.

The day may come when conflicting interests weaken the Union, but no one can predict when this might happen. The hidden ties that bind the states together are like invisible threads, keeping the giant man united. Any attempt to unravel these ties only strengthens them. When one state talks of leaving, the others band together. If a foreign nation threatens, the entire Union unites. Thus, in every dangerous situation, there is also safety. Despite talk of dissolution, many believe the Union is secure. The British press viewed the slavery controversy in America as a quarrel between North and South, but not an immediate threat to the Union. The turmoil surrounding Lincoln's election was seen as favourable to anti-slavery, with British newspapers condemning the South's stance. The _Times_ praised Lincoln's election, hoping it would halt the spread of slavery and its domineering influence. Other leading journals echoed similar sentiments, with the _Economist_ attributing Lincoln's victory to a shift in voter sympathies and the _Saturday Review_ expressing caution toward the Republican party's potential actions. The _Spectator_ initially viewed the election as a mere political power struggle between parties.|"[""1.

"At first, the English press expressed skepticism towards the South's resistance, believing it would be swiftly suppressed. They doubted foreign aid and questioned if England and France would abandon their long-standing policies for the sake of trade. The press saw the South as uneducated and lawless, comparing them to the Irish peasantry. They believed the fate of the Union lay in the hands of the ""poor or mean whites"" of the South. Despite initial confusion and ignorance, the British press eventually acknowledged the seriousness of the conflict in America. Lord John Russell and Lord Lyons exchanged concerned letters, with the latter slowly grasping the inevitability of secession.

The British press in the 1860s held varying opinions regarding the American Civil War. Initially, many believed that the conflict was over slavery, with the _Edinburgh Review_ attributing the crisis to this issue. The _Times_ echoed this sentiment, stating that the South sought to preserve slavery. However, as the situation unfolded, some British publications like the _Dublin News_ and the _Saturday Review_ expressed support for the North, emphasizing freedom and condemning the South's social structure. The _London Chronicle_ went as far as calling the Southern states treacherous. Overall, the British press was largely critical of the South, with the _London Review_ highlighting slavery as a key factor. The _Quarterly Review_ even suggested that the protective tariff advocated by the North was a cause of Southern secession.|['1.

At a distance of three thousand miles, Southern planters were likened to English country gentlemen, fostering kinship with those in England who revered old traditions. This 'Southern gentleman' theory, though partly true, was often discussed by reviewers and London Clubs. However, not all reviews shared this view; the Radical _Westminster_ argued that slavery was the core issue. Lincoln, elected on an anti-slavery platform, focused on preserving the Union rather than abolishing slavery where it existed. Efforts were made for compromise, but as secession loomed, uncertainty grew in Britain regarding American affairs. Some believed British interests could benefit from America's division, causing a shift in British sympathy. The British government, attentive to its interests, was accused of secretly hoping for America's breakup. Yet, amidst the passions of the Civil War, criticism of Britain's stance should be viewed with caution.|"[""1.

When examining the evidence from official and private diplomatic sources, there is no concrete proof of animosity towards the United States from Lord John Russell and Lord Lyons. The British Minister at Washington, Lord Lyons, maintained impartiality in his reports, even amidst the rising tensions following Lincoln's election. Lord Russell instructed British agents to remain neutral and avoid expressing opinions that could worsen relations with either American faction. The first issue requiring British intervention arose when South Carolina seized the Federal customs house in Charleston. Despite the uncertainty and division between Northern and Southern statesmen, Russell believed that the break-up of the Union was inevitable. He hoped for a peaceful resolution and instructed Lyons to act cautiously to protect British trade interests from the potential consequences of a civil conflict in America.|"[""1.

Until March 1861, British public and official views did not anticipate armed conflict or a strong Northern effort to reclaim the South. This initial British stance was based on a misunderstanding. As the true situation unfolded, public sentiment shifted away from a united pro-Northern stance towards a more critical view. Some speculated that the Northern States should have seized the opportunity to separate from the South. There were even suggestions that Britain might allow the North to annex Canada for compensation. The _Times_, a prominent British newspaper, shifted its stance as civil war in America loomed. It expressed concerns about the impact of war on British trade and commerce. The paper began to acknowledge the strength of the South and its military capabilities. This change in tone was reflected in other British publications as well. Ultimately, public opinion in Britain was against a war to restore the Union, viewing it as futile.|"[""1.

In February 1861, during the American Civil War, British statesmen faced a dilemma over their governmental attitude towards the conflict. Lord Lyons, the British representative, was unable to provide guidance on the Southern movement. Consuls in the South, like Bunch, offered insights. Bunch was critical of the South, particularly Davis, whom he deemed the only capable leader but with aggressive expansionist tendencies. Despite Bunch's negative views, he acknowledged the South's independence. Meanwhile, Seward, the future Secretary of State, expressed confidence in restoring unity in America. However, he also hinted at the possibility of a foreign war to unite America against European interference. British statesmen, led by Russell, emphasized a neutral stance and cautioned against provoking American hostility. The appointment of Charles Francis Adams as Minister to London was seen as a positive step towards maintaining amicable relations.|"[""1.

Mr. Adams, a member of the House of Representatives from Massachusetts, is known for his calm demeanor and independence. He recently made a notable speech in Congress addressing the complaints of Southern States, expressing a willingness to make concessions. His wife, Mrs. Adams, hails from a prominent family in Massachusetts. In contrast, Southern Commissioners, including Mann and Yancey, are described less favorably. Mann's personal character is criticized, while Yancey, a strong pro-slavery advocate, is seen as a leader in the secession movement. The British Consuls in the North, like Archibald, express strong support for the Northern cause and suggest England offer mediation in favor of the North. Lyons, the British Consul, discusses with Seward the importance of cheap cotton for England and the potential need to recognize the Southern Confederacy to secure access to Southern ports.|"['1.

Lyons advised Russell not to reject the Southern Commissioners upon their arrival in London but to treat them well, hoping this would change Seward's perspective. Lyons doubted Seward's ability to act as strongly as he spoke, believing more moderate advice was prevailing in Washington. The British Minister in Washington was concerned about trade interruption to Southern ports and worked to maintain it, even considering trade continuation during a civil war. Lyons pushed to prevent trade disruption, fearing it might lead to British recognition of the South. The British press and public were starting to accept the separation as final, with some newspapers mocking the North's situation. Despite the tension, Russell aimed to avoid conflict and keep a distance from the Southern Commissioners, influenced by Seward's aggressive stance.|"[""1.

The Congress in Montgomery was praised for its industry, care, and propriety, with no member seen under the influence of alcohol. The British press shifted opinions, praising Southern leaders' sagacity over Northern stupidity. While some believed the North might win, they thought it would be disastrous for federalism. By May, most journals supported the South's right to secede. The _Daily News_ emerged as a strong Northern supporter, with Harriet Martineau aiding with pro-Northern articles. Literary figures like Robert Browning supported the Northern cause early on. Despite some pro-Southern sentiments, there was still widespread distaste for slavery. The issue of slavery was brought to light even in the _Times_ through W.H. Russell's critical descriptions of slave auctions.

Slavery was still a concern in Britain, but the focus was shifting to the birth of a new world State. The British anti-slavery opponents feared prompt recognition of this new State, but the British Government showed no inclination to rush this decision. Lyons, a diplomat, urged caution to avoid harming British trade. As tensions rose and civil war erupted in America with the fall of Fort Sumter, British officials hoped for a peaceful resolution but faced the reality of war. The British Foreign Secretary, Russell, carefully navigated the situation, refusing to commit to a specific policy. The conflict raised questions about England's stance under international law.

Before Adams' appointment as Minister to England, Sumner's supporters from Massachusetts were advocating for him to take the position. Longfellow was actively involved in supporting Sumner. John Bright later criticized a leading journal for not publishing fair articles about the United States since Lincoln became president. William E. Forster, of Quaker descent, became a strong advocate for the North in Parliament, aligning with John Bright. Forster's contributions to the American cause were highly valued, with some considering them the most valuable by any Englishman.

In June of 1859, a brief Conservative Government led by Lord Derby was replaced by a coalition Liberal Government with Palmerston at the helm, alongside Foreign Secretary Lord John Russell. Political pundits foresaw potential clashes due to differing ideologies. Gladstone, a former Peelite Tory, joined as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Palmerston's promise of financial autonomy, while Sir George Cornewall Lewis acted as a rival leader. Lord Granville, a Conservative-Liberal, mediated between factions. Palmerston, aged seventy-seven, focused on political intricacies to maintain power. His goal was to retain office, aided by an understanding with Opposition leader Lord Derby to avoid challenging his position. The Cabinet, leaning towards Conservative-Liberal views, shared a reluctance for further democratic expansion. Despite some support from outspoken Radicals like John Bright and Cobden, the Cabinet, including Gladstone, remained cautious about embracing liberal ideals.|"['1.

"The British Government's attitude toward democracy during the American Civil War in 1861 was not clearly defined. The government, led by various liberal elements, operated with each representative managing their department independently. Palmerston's opinions held weight, but he rarely expressed them. Lord Russell, particularly in foreign affairs, held significant influence. The government was often referred to as the ""Palmerston-Russell Ministry."" Gladstone and Lewis were prominent figures, with Gladstone's abilities acknowledged, although his political stance was unclear. The British government showed little interest in American affairs before mid-1861, focusing on European matters. Lord Derby and Disraeli led opposition but did not address American issues. Overall, Lord Russell's policies shaped British foreign policy, especially concerning America, due to his expertise in the matter. The British perception of American Secretary of State Seward was mixed, considering him both anti-slavery and potentially anti-British."|"[""1.

In April 1861, the American Minister to London, Charles Francis Adams, awaited his arrival in London. The Southern Government, led by Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens, was not well known in England. Davis, a former U.S. Senator, lacked a clear foreign policy, and his Cabinet lacked distinction. Davis initially focused on home controversies, delaying a strong foreign policy. Meanwhile, Yancey and Rost, known for extreme pro-slavery views, arrived in London. In America, the South had a clear secession policy, while the North, led by Lincoln, was still uncertain. Some in the North, like Sumner, were open to Southern secession. Seward, the new Secretary of State, opposed coercing the South. This uncertainty left British statesmen puzzled about the American situation.|"['1.

On April 13, 1861, the American Civil War began when the Confederacy attacked Fort Sumter in Charleston. This event sparked a wave of patriotism in both the North and the South, leading to preparations for war. News of the conflict reached London on April 27, and by April 29, it was clear that civil war was inevitable. The South, lacking a navy, issued a proclamation for privateers, while the North declared they would treat them as pirates. Both sides began making military preparations. British officials and the public were surprised by the sudden outbreak of war in America, and British policy towards the conflict quickly evolved. The British government had been considering its response to such a situation, and discussions began in Parliament about the civil war. Despite the ties of blood between Britain and America, there was concern about the conflict. Lord John Russell, the British Foreign Secretary, met with Southern commissioners to discuss their representation and the possibility of recognition but made no commitments. The Southern commissioners left the meeting feeling optimistic about British actions.|"['1.

On May 3, Russell received a memorandum from the Attorney-General regarding the recognition of the South's belligerency and their right to issue letters of marque and reprisal. The memorandum acknowledged the risks to British commerce but saw no immediate solution. The Attorney-General suggested that European nations should ensure the war followed the principles of 'Justum Bellum' and the rules of the Treaty of Paris if the Southern States were recognized as belligerents. Russell quickly matured British policy, deciding to recognize the South's belligerent rights. This decision was communicated to Lyons on May 4, followed by formal instructions on May 6. The British government also sought France's prompt recognition of Southern belligerent rights. The rapid policy formulation highlighted the need to address privateering and blockades in the American conflict while maintaining neutrality. The _Times_ editorial on May 9 reflected general approval of England's evolving stance on the conflict.|"[""1.

On May 2, Ewart in the Commons raised concerns about Privateers under unrecognized flags being treated as Pirates, reflecting Parliament's worry over Davis and Lincoln's proclamations. Russell assured that British interests were protected by a fleet sent out. Gregory, a Southern sympathizer, questioned whether the US knew effective blockades were required for recognition and if the South could issue letters of marque. Russell clarified that the US wasn't informed about blockades needing to be effective. He stated that Southern privateers couldn't be seen as pirates, as Britain would then have to treat them as such. The matter of privateering raised new questions under the Declaration of Paris. The British Government acted swiftly due to the threat to its commercial interests. Reports from officials in America confirmed the looming war. Lyons expressed sympathy for the North but feared encouraging civil war. The Proclamation of Neutrality was issued on May 13, warning British subjects not to partake in the war. The Proclamation outlined rules for British citizens regarding enlistment and equipment of war vessels, emphasizing the consequences for violating it. The Parliamentary discussion on May 16 clarified the Government's policy towards the South as a belligerent, recognizing the right of privateering but highlighting the need for effective blockades.|"['1.

The British Parliament's discussion regarding the American conflict focused solely on legal matters and their potential implications. On May 15, Russell shared the official Proclamation with Lyons, leaving it to Lyons' discretion to communicate it to Seward. This discretion was common in diplomatic practices since the Proclamation was directed at British subjects, not the belligerents. The lack of official communication of the Proclamation led to disagreements, with the United States objecting to its issuance and timing by the British Government. Adams, the new American Minister, arrived in Liverpool on May 13 and sought an audience with Queen Victoria after an interrupted meeting with Russell. The press, especially the _Times_, emphasized the need for strict neutrality in the conflict, as both American sides sought British support. The _Times_ viewed the war as driven by selfish motives rather than principles or patriotism, likening it to historical conflicts resolved by force. Adams expressed concerns about the uncertain British stance on the conflict, fearing it could worsen the North-South divide.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat was the main focus of the British Parliament's discussion regarding the American conflict?\nA) Military strategies\nB) Legal matters\nC) Economic implications\nD) Social consequences\nE) Political alliances"", 'Question 2:\nWhy was the discretion to communicate the Proclamation left to Lyons by Russell?\nA) Lyons was a close friend of Seward\nB) The Proclamation was meant for the belligerents\nC) Russell was unavailable to deliver it\nD) Lyons was responsible for British subjects\nE) The Proclamation was confidential', ""Question 3:\nWhat led to disagreements between the United States and the British Government?\nA) Lack of official communication\nB) The arrival of Adams\nC) Queen Victoria's audience with Adams\nD) The interruption of a meeting with Russell\nE) The _Times_ press coverage"", 'Question 4:\nWhat did the _Times_ emphasize regarding the American conflict?\nA) Military advancements\nB) Political alliances\nC) Neutrality\nD) Economic benefits\nE) Social implications', 'Question 5:\nHow did the _Times_ view the war in terms of motives?\nA) Driven by principles\nB) Driven by patriotism\nC) Driven by selfish motives\nD) Driven by historical conflicts\nE) Resolved peacefully', 'Question 6:\nWhat did Adams express concerns about regarding the British stance on the conflict?\nA) Military support\nB) Economic aid\nC) Political alliances\nD) Neutrality\nE) Social reforms']"|['B) Legal matters', 'D) Lyons was responsible for British subjects', 'A) Lack of official communication', 'C) Neutrality', 'C) Driven by selfish motives', 'D) Neutrality']
It was advised to proceed with caution in decisions that might fuel hopes among dissatisfied groups in America. The issuance of the Queen's proclamation was regrettable as it elevated the rebels to a belligerent state. The rapid action seemed premature, especially in declaring the insurgents a marine power without proof. The American Minister argued against the British Proclamation of Neutrality, emphasizing the haste in its issuance. The _Spectator_ believed the Proclamation favored the South, while the _Saturday Review_ defended it, stating that recognition of the Southern Government should be delayed until their efforts proved futile. The press mostly supported the Proclamation, except for a few like the _Spectator_. Seward's instructions expressed dissatisfaction with British policies concerning aid to the rebels.|"['1.

The President quickly informed the British Government that he saw their response as potentially harmful to the rights and dignity of the United States. Adams, following these instructions, reported a more positive British stance, attributing it to the North's strong actions and a realization that previous actions were misinterpreted. However, tensions remained high in Washington. Seward adamantly refused to consider the South as having belligerent rights, leading to strained relations. Lyons and Mercier visited Seward to present the British Proclamation and support from France, but Seward declined to discuss the matter. Despite Seward's calm demeanor, the U.S. was not officially informed of British neutrality, allowing American discontent to simmer. The British press urged caution to avoid further aggravating the situation. American criticism focused on British recognition of Southern belligerency, privateer treatment, and Russell's reception of Confederate envoys.|"['1.

During a critical diplomatic encounter, Adams skillfully navigated a potential crisis under Seward's guidance. Russell's ambiguous response, suggesting no further meetings but willingness for written correspondence, divided opinion among the commissioners. Yancey argued that Russell's stance violated British neutrality and demanded a protest, while others sought instructions from Richmond. Adams, in a private letter, reflected on his strategic approach to avoid siding with the Confederacy prematurely. Despite accusations of hasty actions leading to the Proclamation, Adams maintained a cautious stance, waiting for further developments. The debate over the timing and nature of British involvement in the American Civil War continued, with both sides scrutinizing diplomatic nuances and historical precedents to justify their positions.|"[""1.

"The American Minister at that time did not privately hold a view of ""unfriendly animus."" On July 2, 1861, his son, who was a secretary, expressed confidence that the English were supportive of the American cause. However, doubts arose later. The British believed that issuing a Proclamation would help maintain neutrality amid the looming dissolution of the Union. When this did not go as expected, they tried to correct their mistake. Historical analysis now clears the British Government of any unfriendly intentions. The Proclamation was seen as premature by some, including John Bright. The British Ministry initially maintained a hands-off approach but had to act swiftly once actual conflict erupted in America. The issuance of declarations by both sides, including Lincoln's on blockade and piracy, signaled the start of maritime warfare. The Proclamation served as a necessary notification to British subjects due to the de facto state of war. It was fortunate that the Proclamation was issued before Adams arrived, as it aligned with the Northern administration's theory of the conflict. Adams, upon his arrival, had to accept the situation and could only lodge a complaint. The premature Proclamation prevented a potential rupture in relations between the US and Britain due to conflicting views on the existence of war. The timing of the Proclamation avoided a crisis that could have led to prolonged neutrality by Britain and uncertain outcomes for the United States."|"[""1.

The sympathies of an Englishman naturally lean towards the North, but forming any kind of alliance with the current officials could lead to an unsustainable position. They would likely make endless demands and show no regard for our neutral rights once they felt secure. If there was hope of reconstructing the Union or bringing the South to a more content or obedient state, one might consider cooperating due to anti-slavery sentiments. However, it seems all possibility of this has vanished forever. This sentiment contrasts with the approach of American President Wilson at the start of the Great War in 1914, where he emphasized the importance of impartiality and restraint in expressing sympathies publicly or privately.|"['1.

In 1861, during the Civil War in the United States, there was a delay in the official French Proclamation supporting the British Proclamation. Lyons, the British representative, trusted Mercier, his French colleague, who had been instructed to back the British Proclamation. However, no official French Proclamation was issued until June 10, causing Lyons to feel the need for an explanation. Mercier informally shared his instructions with Seward but made no official communication at Seward's request. Lyons later adopted the same approach. This method of dealing with Seward became common, although it annoyed both British and French Ministers. Seward emphasized that neither Britain nor France could undermine the United States' sovereignty over the insurgents. The protests against the Queen's Proclamation and interviews with Southern commissioners were considered unjustifiable by some.|"[""1.

"The previous chapter focused on the formal American arguments and British responses regarding international practices. In addition to these formal discussions, there was a plan for potential military action against Great Britain linked to the instructions of the American Secretary of State. This plan, labeled ""Seward's Foreign War Panacea"" by historians, was scrutinized in detail. The British government harbored suspicions that Seward was swiftly advancing this plan. Public perception in Britain, influenced by Seward's past comments and actions, viewed him as anti-British. Seward's history of criticizing British policies, predicting Canada's annexation to the US, and inciting Irish animosity against Britain fueled these suspicions. The British government, particularly Minister Lyons, closely monitored Seward's role in the new administration. Despite Seward's denial of certain statements, the British remained wary, especially after the ""Newcastle story"" suggesting Seward's willingness to provoke a conflict with Britain to divert attention from internal strife."|"['1.

In the new Cabinet, Chase of Ohio and Seward of New York were key figures expected to lead. Seward, the Secretary of State, was seen as the logical leader due to his political experience and high regard among anti-slavery groups. Seward, a former candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, was believed to shape the administration's policies. However, challenges to Seward's leadership arose, particularly regarding the handling of Fort Sumter. Seward's conciliatory approach aimed to delay conflict and believed in a strong Union sentiment in the South. Despite assurances to Confederate representatives, Seward's policy faced scrutiny as the decision on reinforcing Fort Sumter loomed. The situation highlighted the tension between Seward's strategy and the need for decisive action within the Cabinet.|"['1.

The issue was at a standstill for a while. The Confederate Commissioners viewed Seward's delay strategy as advantageous for the South's plans and did not push for a decision. Seward had assured South Carolina that they would be notified if there was a decision to reinforce Fort Sumter. However, by the end of March, Lincoln realized that defending Federal forts was crucial for preserving the Union. He chose to reinforce Fort Sumter, a decision that surprised Seward and challenged his peaceful approach. Seward's attempt to change the focus from slavery to union or disunion was met with Lincoln's firm response. Lincoln's direction in handling domestic and foreign affairs differed from Seward's proposals. Despite Seward's efforts to prevent civil war and seek foreign aid, the reinforcement of Fort Sumter marked the beginning of conflict. The fall of Fort Sumter shifted public opinion towards preserving the Union through force, although Seward still hoped for a peaceful resolution with the South.|"[""1.

In April, Schleiden proposed an armistice to prevent bloodshed between the North and South. He consulted with Prussian and American officials, including Seward and Lincoln. Lincoln expressed concern for the safety of the government and willingness to consider peaceful proposals. However, he did not commit to negotiation terms. Despite the discouraging response, Schleiden traveled to Richmond to meet with Vice-President Stephens. Stephens believed peaceful resolution attempts were futile. The South had already ratified the Confederacy's constitution. Schleiden returned to Washington on April 27, finding a shift towards combativeness. Seward, realizing the failure of conciliatory efforts, emphasized the importance of maintaining the Union. Despite Seward's attempts, hope for peaceful resolution faded, leading to a more assertive stance.|"['1.

"Seward's theory about the unifying impact of a foreign conflict was known in Washington. He shared this idea with Schleiden on January 26, expressing a wish for a war with England, France, or Spain to restore internal peace. Despite this, Lincoln's administration took a different approach, emphasizing friendly relations with foreign powers. However, by April 27, upon hearing that Russell was non-committal on British policy, Seward turned to threats. This shift in tone was evident to Lyons, who described Seward as ""arrogant and reckless toward Foreign Powers."" Seward's belligerent stance became more pronounced when he learned of Britain's neutrality declaration. On May 17, in a letter home, Seward expressed confidence in his foreign policy but lamented the lack of trust in his efforts. This led to the drafting of ""Despatch No. 10,"" which Lincoln softened to avoid provoking war.

During a crucial time in the Northern administration, Seward's No. 10 despatch caused tension among Foreign Ministers in Washington. Seward's warlike intentions sparked fear and suspicion, especially from British Minister Lord Lyons, who believed Seward directed his enmity towards England. Lyons urged a stiff attitude from Britain to defend Canada and establish close ties with France. Despite Seward's threats being seen as bluster, Lyons remained cautious and suggested readiness for war as a preventative measure. The situation led to anxious preparations, with warnings to the Governor of Canada and concerns about Seward's behavior. However, by May 27, there was a more positive tone from Seward, indicating a shift in policy and a decrease in the fear of conflict with England.|"[""1.

British Ministers in London were somewhat worried by the situation, but not as much as Lyons. They were uneasy and harbored suspicions about the American Secretary of State. Palmerston expressed concern in a letter to Russell, stating that Mr. Seward might provoke a conflict with Britain due to arrogance or political motives. He suggested sending more troops to Canada as a precaution, emphasizing the need for local defense. Russell, on the other hand, was less troubled, appreciating Adams' demeanor and doubting Seward's ability to incite a quarrel. Lyons in Washington, however, feared the possibility of sudden war declarations by the United States, especially with Canada vulnerable to attack. He urged England to act swiftly with a strong naval force to end the conflict promptly. Despite the tense situation, Lyons aimed to maintain amicable relations with America.|"[""1.

Lyons was almost a month behind in knowing America's foreign policy towards England. He mistakenly believed an American attack on England was imminent, but this wasn't the case. Despite this, it was understandable given Seward's influence and Lincoln's lack of it. Lyons reported suspiciously due to Seward's actions, but later Seward clarified there was no intention of causing trouble with England. Seward credited himself for avoiding conflict by not acknowledging England's support for the South. Lyons, however, attributed the change to England's stern stance rather than the President's intervention. The correspondence between Adams and Seward played a crucial role in easing tensions between the nations. Seward's initial foreign war policy was later denied, and the Northern disaster at Bull Run did not influence the friendly expressions towards foreign powers. Lincoln's refusal to follow Seward's lead and the lessening of his aggressive tone preceded any news from England, lightening the initial tensions. Seward's policy did not lead to war as Lincoln intervened promptly.|"[""1.

Rudolph Schleiden, originally from Schleswig, attended the University of Berlin and later served in the Danish customs. During the German revolution of 1848, he represented Schleswig-Holstein in the Frankfort Parliament. Following the revolution's failure, Schleiden moved to Bremen and in 1853 became a Minister to the United States. By 1860, he was a well-known figure in Washington's diplomatic circles, with close ties to influential Americans. His reports on the events leading up to and during the Civil War were scrutinized by Dr. Ralph H. Lutz in 1910. Schleiden's dispatches are now housed in the Library of Congress, thanks to the efforts of Mr. Frederic Bancroft.

In 1861, during the American Civil War, Secretary of State Seward initiated negotiations with Great Britain to gain support for the Northern cause. This was also Ambassador Adams' first diplomatic negotiation in London. The negotiation involved the United States offering to adhere to the Declaration of Paris of 1856, which set rules for maritime warfare. Despite the significance of this effort, the negotiation ultimately failed. The negotiation was crucial as it marked an attempt to rally European nations behind the Northern states. Adams, new to diplomacy, placed great importance on this negotiation, even allowing personal disappointment to affect his judgment.

During a historical negotiation between Great Britain and the United States, which has been largely overlooked in history, there was a significant impact on the relationship between the two nations. Although this negotiation did not lead to a treaty, it played a crucial role in shaping the attitudes of both countries and their representatives. While the details of the negotiation can be found in various historical works, only a few scholars have delved deeply into its motives and implications. Notable figures such as Henry Adams, Bancroft, and Charles Francis Adams have offered differing interpretations of the events. The negotiation stemmed from a maritime agreement in 1854 during the Crimean War, where Great Britain and France agreed to respect neutral commerce under either a neutral or enemy flag. This agreement was later formalized at the Congress of Paris in 1856, with several maritime nations adopting the Declaration of Paris. Despite widespread acceptance, the United States refused to accede to the declaration, citing concerns about private property at sea and the use of privateers in maritime warfare. This refusal set the stage for further diplomatic developments between the nations.|['1.

After receiving instructions, Adams met with Russell on May 18 to discuss the American stance on the British Proclamation of Neutrality. Adams mentioned the need to adhere to the Declaration of Paris through a convention. Russell indicated that negotiations could proceed through Lord Lyons. Adams awaited further guidance from Washington. Earlier, Russell had suggested to France that both countries propose adherence to the Declaration of Paris to the American belligerents. France agreed, and Russell informed Lyons on May 18, the same day he met with Adams. Confusion arose regarding where the agreement should be finalized, leading to delays. On July 18, Russell informed Adams that Britain was ready to sign a convention if France did the same. Adams submitted a draft, and after delays, both parties were ready to sign. However, differences in perspectives on the American conflict delayed the process. Russell proposed a declaration to prevent misunderstandings, but Adams sought clarity from Washington before proceeding.|"['1.

"The negotiations between the United States and Great Britain during the Civil War ended without an agreement. Henry Adams, in his essay ""The Declaration of Paris, 1861,"" suggests that Britain's Foreign Secretary, Russell, engaged in deceptive tactics to gain an advantage in commercial and maritime competition. Adams accuses Russell of evading American proposals and trying to manipulate the situation to benefit Britain's interests. The negotiations were filled with delays and miscommunications, leading to a lack of trust between the parties. Adams concludes that Britain's true motive was to revive old practices of seizing enemy goods under neutral flags once the American War was over. This historical account sheds light on the complexities of international diplomacy and the importance of understanding motives behind negotiations."|"['1.

In 1891, an analysis was published that depicted a strained relationship between Russell and Lyons, with Russell being accused of deceit and evasion. The analysis highlighted a selfish British policy and France blindly following Russell's lead. The American proposal aimed to improve international war practices. When Frederic Bancroft, a biographer of Seward, examined the negotiation, he questioned if there was more to it than met the eye. Seward's goal was to have European nations treat Southern privateers as pirates, but this was not clear to all involved. Despite obstacles, Seward persisted, aiming to force other nations to view the Confederates as pirates. The negotiation was complex, with ulterior motives suspected on both sides. Seward's persistence, even after European recognition of Southern belligerency, showed his determination but lacked foresight into potential complications.|"['1.

This passage discusses the views of different historians on the negotiation during the Civil War era. Charles Francis Adams, in his work about his father, disagreed with his brother Henry Adams' perspective. Adams believed that Secretary of State Seward's negotiation with Britain and France was part of a strategy to potentially provoke a war if these nations didn't support the Union against Southern privateering. Adams also examined British actions, exonerating Lyons but criticizing Russell's proposals. Ultimately, the negotiation was seen as a diplomatic farce by Adams. The passage also addresses the fallacy in Adams' thesis, highlighting the timeline of events and Seward's evolving foreign policy stance. The negotiation was not a direct result of Seward's desire for a foreign war, as it predated key events that influenced his policies.|"[""1.

A study of historical documents reveals British policy on the Declaration of Paris. In early May, the British government learned of the impending civil war in America. Concerned about privateers, Russell sought to protect British interests. By May 6, a policy of strict neutrality was announced, aligning with France. Despite the absence of ulterior motives, Britain proposed adherence to the Declaration's articles to both American parties. Anxious debates ensued regarding privateering and piracy. France's reluctance to address privateers prompted a shift in British strategy, focusing on all Declaration articles. However, French concerns led to adjustments, emphasizing instructions to American diplomats. As negotiations progressed, unexpected developments arose during meetings with Southern commissioners and American representatives, revealing the complexities of international relations during this critical period.|"['1.

In a letter dated May 18, Russell instructed Lyons to relay a message to the British Consul in Charleston or New Orleans, to be shared with the President of the Confederate States. Russell expressed his desire for the government to recognize the Declaration of Paris regarding privateering. However, he made it clear that the British government could not accept the renunciation of privateering by the United States if it was contingent upon enforcing this renunciation on the Confederate States. Russell emphasized that the British government would uphold vigilance in enforcing the law of nations. He hoped to persuade both the North and the South to renounce privateering. While Russell's message to Lyons was cautious and aimed at maintaining neutrality, he also hinted at the possibility of influencing Thouvenel to align with his views on the matter.|"['1.

Lord Cowley informed that while M. Mercier wasn't explicitly told to discuss ending privateering, he had some freedom to decide if it was necessary. Lyons and Mercier better understood Seward's intentions than Russell. Lyons was advised to use his judgment on cooperating with the French Minister as long as both countries agreed. They were to follow the most diplomatic approach. Lyons foresaw Seward's reaction, knowing that adherence to the Declaration of Paris wouldn't stop Southern privateering. Despite this, Russell in London was eager to pursue the abolition of privateering worldwide without threatening the Confederate States. Lyons and Mercier were cautious, hoping the issue would be handled in London and Paris. Seward expected a convention to bind England and France to help stop Southern privateering. Lyons and Mercier considered notifying Seward officially of English and French neutrality but delayed awaiting further instructions. Their attempt to approach Seward together was rejected, prompting them to consider alternative ways to engage with the Confederacy.|"[""1.

The issue was moved to London and Paris. Lyons' report was received on June 30, stating that Adams would receive new instructions. Russell responded on July 5, claiming Adams never proposed the Declaration of Paris. On July 11, Adams offered to sign a convention and sent a draft on the thirteenth. Russell, showing sincerity and no ulterior motives, recalled instructions to Lyons about contacting the Confederacy on July 12. He wanted to avoid friction with the United States. Despite warnings, Russell was eager to secure American adherence to the Declaration and was ready to conclude the convention immediately. France's reluctance and suspicion delayed the process. Adams and Dayton refused to sign on August 20 due to a British suspicion. This negotiation initiated by Seward aimed to secure friendly foreign attitudes and prevent the recognition of Southern belligerency.|"['1.

Adams believed the United States was offering to follow international rules supported by maritime powers, feeling aggrieved by suspicion toward American efforts. This led to disappointment for both Adams and Russell. Russell, despite his high regard for Adams, experienced disillusionment. Initially advocating for strict neutrality, Russell shifted his focus to persuading the U.S. to fully adhere to international rules. He faced obstacles but persisted, eventually making a declaration to safeguard British neutrality. This process caused tensions and suspicions on both sides, leading to doubts about the sustainability of a neutral stance. The negotiation's failure had unintended consequences, impacting the relationship between the United States and Britain.|"[""1.

In 1861, during the Civil War, there was a lot of international tension over maritime law. Palmerston suggested communicating with the South and North through specific individuals. However, Russell was hesitant to act on these suggestions, as seen in his correspondence with Lyons and Mercier. They were cautious about approaching the South and feared repercussions from Seward. Stoeckl, a Russian diplomat, also expressed concern over the delicate negotiations, advising Russia to stay out of the situation. The international environment was tense, with various countries navigating the complexities of the Civil War and international maritime laws.|"['1.

In 1861, there were important discussions between diplomats regarding international maritime law. Lyons, a British representative, clarified to Seward that he did not have instructions to sign a convention. Lyons also noted Mercier's cautious approach in dealing with Seward, suggesting that personal communication of documents to Seward was Mercier's idea. Meanwhile, Russell, another British official, defended Britain's stance on neutrality to Edward Everett in Boston, emphasizing that they did not consider five million freemen as pirates. Palmerston's note to Russell, although not directly sent to Adams, was referenced in a communication to Adams, highlighting the ongoing diplomatic exchanges during this period.|"['1.

During the Civil War, diplomatic negotiations between nations like Britain and the Confederacy played a crucial role. For example, in July 1861, British Minister Lyons started discussions with the South through Consul Bunch in Charleston. This move was later supported by British Secretary Russell. On August 14, 1861, the Confederate Commissions protested against a British order that seemed biased towards the Union, affecting the Declaration of Paris talks. Despite some interesting facts about Southern privateering during this time, like no privateer leaving a foreign port or entering a British one, the public remained mostly unaware of these diplomatic intricacies. Meanwhile, in America, after the attack on Fort Sumter, President Lincoln rapidly mobilized troops and increased the army and navy to prepare for the impending conflict, resulting in over 300,000 available troops by July 1.|['1.

"In the South, Davis was busy calling for volunteers to protect the Confederacy. Seven states seceded, joined by four more. Lincoln's ""border state policy"" held Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri to the Union. The Northern Congress approved Lincoln's measures, authorizing an army and loans. The British press believed the South had the decision to secede. The North prepared to preserve the Union. The _Economist_ questioned the South's actions, urging the North to avoid a futile war. By June, British press and public opinion shifted towards the South. Motley's letter defended the North's position against secession. He argued against peaceful secession and denied a Northern anti-slavery purpose. This led to a reevaluation of the American conflict by the British press, questioning the moral principles at stake."|"[""1.

During the early stages of the American Civil War, the British press closely followed the preparations of both Northern and Southern forces leading up to the first battle of Bull Run on July 21. The Northern army, initially successful, faced a humiliating defeat in this battle, which revealed their lack of military strength. British newspapers, such as the _Daily News_, initially praised Lincoln's leadership and the North's cause, but the outcome of Bull Run shifted opinions towards skepticism about Northern fighting capabilities. War correspondent W.H. Russell's reports in the _Times_ further emphasized the South's energy and determination, casting doubt on the North's abilities. The British public, influenced by these reports, began to question the North's chances of success in the war. Despite these sentiments, the British government maintained a policy of strict neutrality, avoiding official statements that could upset either side.|"[""1.

The Civil War in America had nothing to do with black slavery, as the conflict stemmed from the North's idolization of their Republic. The false principles of the American Republic were being exposed, revealing it as a mere bubble or a worthless tyranny of the sovereign mob. This early hint of democracy's future was a topic of cautious discussion in newspapers. While some believed the North would succeed in reducing the South, others were more skeptical. Various publications debated the American crisis, with differing views on secession and the role of slavery. The _Spectator_ and the _Daily News_ took contrasting stances on the conflict, with the former defending the North and the latter criticizing the South. The British press was divided on the issue, with some advocating for the dissolution of the Union for the benefit of Europe, while others warned against the potential consequences of such a breakup.|"['1.

In the fall of 1861, British policy towards America was one of strict neutrality, approved by all papers and speakers. As the war in America progressed without major battles, attention shifted to the economic impact on England and the North's effective blockade. The _Saturday Review_ supported neutrality but emphasized distinguishing between observing the blockade and recognizing the Confederacy's government once the Southern states secured their independence. The British press, known for its vigorous writing, generally agreed on neutrality but varied in tone from dignified criticism to extreme vituperation. The recall of the British consul Bunch by Seward in Charleston sparked controversy, revealing the delicate diplomatic dance between Britain and the United States during the Civil War.|"['1.

Bunch had given Mure a paper that was seen as a passport by Mure and the United States. Adams complained to Russell about Bunch for three main reasons: (1) negotiating with the Confederacy, (2) issuing a passport without the required State Department signature, and (3) allowing the passport holder to carry letters from US enemies. The British Government was asked to remove Bunch. Lyons initially defended Bunch's actions, stating the sealed bag held nothing incriminating. Privately, both Lyons and Russell had doubts. Bunch claimed he gave Mure a certificate, not a passport, but Mure was a US citizen. Bunch had sent private letters with official ones before. Lyons reported a conversation with the French Consul praising the negotiation with the South. Russell believed Lincoln wouldn't risk a conflict. France supported Bunch's actions. Russell informed Adams that the bag contained no enemy correspondence and defended Bunch's actions regarding the Declaration of Paris.|"['1.

"The undersigned declines any responsibility for the statement that Great Britain has taken the first step towards recognizing the Southern States, as Her Majesty's Government has only acknowledged them as belligerents, not as a separate independent state. Russell was cautious, advising Lyons to express diplomatically that any misunderstandings with the Washington Government would be resolved, and Lyons hoped to avoid abstract assertions, instead focusing on British recognition of Southern belligerent rights. Bunch's denial to Lyons focused on three points: disbelief in Mure carrying official despatches, assurance that all documents were for Her Majesty's service, and clarification of the ""passport"" as a certificate for Mure. Russell and Lyons were dissatisfied with Bunch's handling of private correspondence and his lack of denial regarding gossip of recognition steps. Seward instructed Adams to revoke Bunch's exequatur, citing Bunch's perceived partisanship towards the South. Lyon's view was that the charges against Bunch lacked substantial evidence, and he diplomatically left the meeting with Seward after reading the revocation instruction."|"[""1.

Lyons foresaw the American decision against Bunch on personal grounds, which he shared with Russell. While Lyons suggested the British response to the allegations, he accepted the American decision. Russell, anticipating Seward's actions, maintained neutrality, even considering the return of Southern Confederates to the Union. Despite Lyons' concerns about future U.S. relations, Russell remained composed. The Bunch controversy highlighted Britain's attempt to engage with the Southern Government, leading to a dispute over British claims to communicate with the Confederacy in defense of British interests. Amidst the _Trent_ affair, tensions rose, but the matter was eventually closed. The debate over cotton scarcity led to discussions between Lyons and Mercier, with Lyons cautioning against intervention due to potential repercussions. The British Cabinet also addressed the cotton issue, influenced by French arguments advocating a robust American policy.|"['1.

In London, Lyons received Mercier's ideas at a crucial time. Just after Adams' complaint and Russell's response, while waiting to see Seward's reaction, Russell wrote to Palmerston about Mercier's insights. Russell believed that any action taken must be significant. He mentioned that England and France breaking a blockade for cotton wouldn't be wise. He stressed that proposing fair terms for peace might be more effective. Meanwhile, in Washington, Seward crafted a diplomatic message to Paris, emphasizing defiance against foreign intervention. Seward skillfully handled the cotton issue while maintaining a firm stance. Lyons and Mercier had differing views on national policy toward America, with Mercier pushing for recognition of the South. However, Lyons remained cautious, indicating that recognition might not be the right move. Their discussions intensified as Mercier tried to persuade Lyons, who remained steadfast in his position. Their divergent views were evident as they debated the implications of recognizing the South.|"['1.

"During the Battle of Bull Run, the British perceived the North as weak in war, casting doubt on their courage. The negotiations for the Declaration of Paris failed in August, leaving Russell anxious. He felt relieved that Britain avoided a potential problem. Following this, news of Mure's arrest and the demand for Bunch's recall by Adams in November caused more tension. The _Trent_ affair on November 8 further escalated uncertainties.

In 1861, it took fourteen days to deliver a letter that would normally arrive in two days. Privateering was seen as unethical by some, suggesting that Southern privateers might be considered pirates. Additionally, there were concerns about the judgment of certain individuals involved in decision-making. Despite attempts to modify instructions, there was resistance to change. In some instances, recall of officials was delayed, impacting diplomatic communications. Criticisms and denials of involvement were part of the diplomatic exchanges during this period.|['1.

A letter from Lyons to Russell dated October 28, 1861, discusses the withdrawal of Bunch's Exequatur. There are two intriguing omissions in the letter. The first omission suggests that Mr. Bunch was targeted to please the American public, while the second indicates the impact of Mr. Seward's despatch on Lyons. In another source, Bonham's research reveals that Bunch was more supportive of the South than Lyons believed. Lyons had proposed letting Bunch stay in Charleston discreetly. It is argued that the United States viewed Bunch as a scapegoat, evidenced by his role as an arbitrator in a U.S.-Colombia case in 1875 while serving as the British Minister in Bogota.|"[""1.

Mason and Slidell managed to evade the blockade at Charleston on October 12, 1861, aboard the Confederate steamer _Theodora_. They arrived in New Providence, Nassau, on the fourteenth and then traveled to Cardenas, Cuba. From there, they made their way to Havana, reaching it on October 22. The group included the envoys, their secretaries, and Slidell's family. On November 7, they set sail for the Danish island of St. Thomas with the intention of catching a British steamer to Southampton. However, their plans were interrupted when the United States sloop of war _San Jacinto_, under Captain Wilkes, intercepted their vessel, the British mail-packet _Trent_, on November 8 in the Bahama Channel. Mason and Slidell, along with their secretaries, were transferred to the _San Jacinto_ and taken to an American port.

Today, Chancellor Dr. Lushington, and other officials met to discuss the American cruiser's arrival to search the West Indian packet carrying Southern envoys. According to international law, the cruiser could stop and search the neutral packet for enemy despatches. To avoid a confrontation, the decision was made to have the _Phaeton_ frigate monitor the situation within British territorial waters. Meanwhile, the American captain, after getting drunk, anchored near Southampton. Concerned about a potential conflict, Palmerston wrote to Adams to express his unease. Adams clarified that the American ship was seeking to intercept another vessel, not interfere with British ships. The British government, following legal advice, realized they could not prevent the American ship from taking action outside their territorial waters.

In history, it's known that Adams quickly learned of the softened language in the first draft of instructions to Lyons. Prince Albert advised toning down the message, hoping to convey that Captain Wilkes' actions were unauthorized. Lyons, before receiving instructions, expressed fear of the outcome and chose to remain silent. Cowley in Paris shared similar concerns, worried about the North and South uniting against Britain. Despite the bitterness in America, the idea seemed unlikely. Confederate agents in London tried to use the Trent affair, but Britain remained neutral. The delay in communication allowed for a calmer assessment by British leaders. Many, like Gladstone and Argyll, hoped to avoid war with America, seeing it as a calamity. Russell, cautious of Seward's policy, considered postponing hostilities if America refused recompense. The press initially demanded immediate action, but Russell sought Parliament's approval before going to war. The public mood shifted from outrage to a more reasoned approach, urging caution and delay in dealing with the crisis.|"[""1.

"During the tense period following the boarding of the British ship Trent, emotions ran high on both sides of the Atlantic. In London, an American resident expressed fears of immediate war due to the intense anger among the people. Meanwhile, in Edinburgh, another American noted the widespread indignation towards the incident. The British press responded with a sharp tone, reflecting the heightened tensions. The American public, equally incensed, celebrated the detention of British envoys and the exercise of the ""right of search,"" seen as a retaliatory measure. The North, already disheartened by the lack of progress in restoring the Union, found a momentary sense of triumph in this bold action. The incident also stirred memories of past grievances, particularly the British practice of the ""right of search,"" leading to a jubilant belief that the United States had finally given Britain a taste of its own medicine. Governor Andrews of Massachusetts even hailed Captain Wilkes' actions as a heroic service. The legality and wisdom of the boarding were debated extensively, with Congress eventually thanking Wilkes for his actions. Despite the widespread approval, Secretary of State Seward and other Cabinet members refrained from endorsing the incident, with hopes pinned on diplomatic solutions to avoid escalating tensions further."|"['1.

The earliest American reactions to the Trent Affair were met with astonishment and a belligerent disposition in Britain. However, as time passed, a note of caution and saner judgment emerged in England, though the demand for redress remained. John Bright's speech in Rochdale on December 4 praised American democracy and urged caution, leading to a shift in British sentiment towards peace. The Times initially criticized Bright but later adopted a more considerate tone towards Americans. Adams noted a slow change in British temper and regretted the American exultation over the event. The British Cabinet was divided between hope and pessimism, with concerns about aiding a slave state. Russell was averse to war and proposed a peaceful solution to the crisis.|"['1.

On December 14, a significant event occurred - the death of the Prince Consort. He was known to have influenced foreign policy decisions, particularly in relation to the _Trent_ issue. His passing did not alter Britain's stance, but it did make the public realize his value in maintaining political stability. Despite the nation mourning his death, attention was also on the American crisis. The approval of Wilkes by the US Congress stirred concern in Britain. Lincoln's silence on the _Trent_ matter puzzled many. The _Times_ expressed unease at the rapid military buildup in the US. As tensions simmered, Adams assured Russell that Wilkes had acted independently. American sentiments towards the _Trent_ incident shifted, influenced by British support for their demands. Amidst fears of war, efforts were made to ease tensions, highlighting the delicate diplomatic balance in play.|"[""1.

"Adams' estimation was accurate. Even the _Morning Post_, widely recognized as Palmerston's mouthpiece, and during the _Trent_ crisis the most 'forceful' of all city newspapers, acknowledged the general public's desire for a peaceful resolution. However, on December 30, it questioned, ""... can a Government [the American] recently elected by popular vote, relying solely on popular backing, risk disappointing public expectations?"" The answer, unfortunately, seemed to be negative. The _Post_ (thus Palmerston?) did indeed, as later accused, ""prolong the tension,"" but not with its previous hostility towards America. The fact that the _Post_ was seen as Palmerston's mouthpiece justified this stance, as it would have been unwise for the Government to prematurely announce an outcome that was still uncertain. Yet, within the Cabinet, there was a more optimistic outlook. Argyll believed Adams' statement to Russell on December 19 was almost conclusive, and Adams himself now believed that the prevailing notion of an American plan to continuously ""humiliate"" Britain was fading: ""at least in this instance, no such intentions had been harbored."" Everyone was puzzled and frustrated by the delay in receiving a response from America, but optimistically believed it signaled an eventual compromise. There could be no certainty until the actual outcome. Russell wrote to Palmerston on January 7, ""I still think Lincoln will yield, but not until the last minute. If it comes to war"|"['1.

Seward's response was quickly published in American newspapers. Lyons noted that it was well-received, and the public seemed calm and satisfied with the outcome. He believed that the war preparations had actually prevented a war. Seward's argument covered many aspects of the incident, discussing international law and the past relations between the nations. He concluded that the envoys should be handed over promptly. This decision faced challenges as Seward had to convince the President and Cabinet, support Wilkes, and manage the public's expectations. The British Government, after receiving the prisoners, considered the incident closed but disagreed with parts of Seward's argument. The release of the envoys led to a decrease in public interest.

The demand for the release of Mason and Slidell was not what stirred America the most, but the warlike tone of the British press and their government's preparations. Even after their surrender, America was further angered by British bragging that America had given in to a threat of war. This led to a cartoon in _Punch_ showing Uncle Sam apologizing to escape punishment from Britannia. America yielded to a threat but resented being told so, viewing it as a sign of British ill-will. In England, there was relief at America's decision but a determination to ignore the released envoys. The _Times_ criticized Mason and Slidell, claiming they were responsible for American prejudice against England, which was not entirely accurate. The British public, except for extreme pro-Southern factions, showed a shift in support towards the North, recognizing the dangers of aligning with a pro-slavery South.|"[""1.

During the Civil War in America, the British government faced a dilemma regarding their stance on the conflict. Influential figures like John Stuart Mill believed that Britain had to show support for the North to prevent the spread of slavery. Despite some debate in Parliament, the government maintained a policy of strict neutrality. Bright, in a speech, emphasized the abolition of slavery as a crucial aspect of the war, aiming to ease American resentment. However, Palmerston defended military preparations as necessary precautions. The incident involving the _Trent_ further highlighted the complexities of Britain's relationship with America during the war. Ultimately, the British public expressed relief when the _Trent_ issue was resolved, emphasizing the importance of avoiding entanglement in the conflict due to differing views on slavery.|"[""1.

Troops were sent to Canada, but due to icy conditions in the St. Lawrence River, they landed in Portland harbor. Seward graciously allowed them to cross Maine to reach Canada, which pleased Great Britain. However, the American press exaggerated the situation, causing derision. Lyons clarified that it was a simple request to land officers' baggage at Portland, not a military maneuver. Lyons was annoyed by Seward's actions and protested against accepting the permission. There were no English troops crossing Maine, despite initial misunderstandings. This incident highlighted the tension between the United States and Great Britain during the Trent affair.

During the Trent Affair in 1861, tensions rose between the United States and Britain. Captain Wilkes' actions were compared to those of the British government, causing concern. Lady Russell expressed regret over the deeds and hoped to avoid war. The British government did not publicly disclose that Wilkes had no authorization for his actions, leading to American complaints. Some believed that British politicians prolonged the conflict for political gain. There is a myth that Russian fleets appeared in American harbors to support the United States during the crisis, but this story is false.

During the Trent Affair in 1861, there was a lot of debate about whether Lincoln or Seward had the wiser approach. While some believed Lincoln's view was more prudent from the start, it is shown that Seward did have the opportunity to read the instructions on the nineteenth. There was suspicion surrounding Seward's anti-British policy, even within Washington, as seen in a dispatch from Schleiden to the Senate of Bremen. Lincoln's reported language, suggesting pressure on Seward to release the prisoners, was actually part of a strategy to propose arbitration to Great Britain. This historical event highlights the diplomatic complexities and decision-making processes during times of international tension.|"[""1.

In the six months after the _Trent_ incident, the relationship between Great Britain and America seemed calmer. However, tension began to rise due to the Northern blockade of Southern ports, affecting British trade. This blockade was initially declared by President Lincoln in April 1861. Even before this, concerns arose about British ships trading with the secession port of Charleston, South Carolina. Efforts were made to prevent any interference with British trade, with hints of possible British intervention to protect it. Despite initial opposition to any blockade, by April 1861, there was a shift in views, considering an attempted blockade better than legislation closing Southern ports. These discussions aimed to caution the American government and prevent actions that could lead to British and French recognition of the Southern Confederacy.|['1.

Lyons believed he could intimidate the North out of a blockade campaign, but when the Civil War began, and Lincoln declared a blockade on April 19, Lyons felt it must be recognized if conducted lawfully. The blockade began at certain Virginia ports on April 30, and by the end of May, warships were stationed at important Southern harbors. The method of warning vessels at the port created uncertainty for British merchants. Lyons was skeptical about blockading a 3,000-mile coastline, but Seward assured him it would be effective. The British press also doubted the blockade's success, believing the war would be short. While there was early acceptance of the American effort, when a plan to close Southern ports legislatively was revived in June, Britain opposed it vigorously. Russell defended Lincoln's method and believed the blockade, if legal and effective, deserved British recognition. The introduction of a Bill in Congress to proclaim closed ports stirred opposition from Britain, especially Russell, who protested vigorously to America. France initially supported the protest but later withdrew, fearing American retaliation. Despite the Bill passing both Houses of Congress, England declared it would not observe a legislative closing of Southern ports. Lyons expressed concern over the potential consequences, as even Sumner supported the Bill, indicating a serious intention to enforce it. Russell sent formal protest instructions, but authorized Lyons to use discretion in communicating the message.|"[""1.

"In June and revised in July, the original instructions hinted at ""reprisals,"" drawing possible French opposition. Despite assurances of safety in the ""Southern Ports Bill,"" Russell sent a robust instruction on August 8, aiming to protect British interests. Seward had already reassured Lyons of US intentions, with France viewing the Bill as a mere paper blockade. Efforts to prepare a solid case for the British public and Parliament were evident in Washington. Seward confidentially shared a decision not to close ports, aiming to avoid the appearance of threats. Lyons' formal declaration on August 12 emphasized Britain's stance on nullifying any decree closing Southern ports held by the Confederates.

"The ""Southern Ports"" Bill was a significant concern for the British government due to its potential impact on trade. The bill, proposed by the Secretary of the Treasury, aimed to address the issue of former customs houses falling under Confederate control. The fourth section of the bill raised alarm as it suggested the declaration of a paper blockade. This move was likely part of the North's initial flurry of actions against the South. The British government closely monitored the situation, particularly focusing on the potential effects on British trade. Despite initial doubts about the effectiveness of the blockade, concerns grew as reports surfaced about plans to block Charleston harbor using sunken ships. This raised fears about the blockade's impact on British trade. The situation intensified after the _Trent_ controversy, leading to increased scrutiny of American actions and their potential consequences on British interests."|[]|[]
"Even in this perspective, as a strategy of bitter and bloody conflict, such an action is not justifiable. It is a plot against international trade and the free connections of the Southern States of America with the civilized world. It is a scheme only suitable for primitive times. There was no evidence in Lyons' reports or the American news extracts to support such claims. Lyons had only mentioned that some in America had criticized the project as ""odious and barbarous,"" adding, ""The issue seems to hinge on how much the harbors will be permanently harmed."" It is worth noting that Russell did not mention information from Lyons but rather ""apparently good authority"" to justify his strong condemnation. However, the vigor and accusations of American ""barbarism"" did not surface in the British press until after news broke of the release of Mason and Slidell. The Liverpool Shipowners' Association raised concerns about Charleston harbor being closed by stone boats and urged government action. Hammond promptly responded, quoting Russell's previous letter and promising further action. Russell then instructed Lyons to speak to Seward, but with a less harsh tone, emphasizing the potential harm to the United States itself if the harbors were permanently damaged. Today, it seems absurd that anyone, other than the most uninformed observer, would have believed that the North intended to permanently destroy Southern port facilities out of revenge. There was no valid basis for the extreme British view of the Northern strategy. Even renowned poet Robert Browning expressed concern about Charleston potentially returning"|"['1.

Within three months, the British government faced their first serious debate on the effectiveness of the American Civil War blockade. Pressure from France prompted a reevaluation of their neutrality policy due to the blockade's impact. Simultaneously, the Mexican Republic posed a challenge to European nations, leading to joint efforts by France, Great Britain, and Spain to address Mexican debts. President Buchanan warned Europe against territorial ambitions in Mexico. France, however, had ulterior motives, aiming to establish a colonial empire. British Ambassador Cowley and Foreign Secretary Russell grew wary of France's intentions, leading to British forces withdrawing from Mexico. This suspicion of France's hidden agenda in Mexico influenced British policy towards the Civil War, aligning them more closely with the North. Ultimately, British skepticism towards France's Mexican ambitions fostered a more amicable relationship with the United States.|"['1.

During the Civil War, British statesmen were anxious about the blockade on America but did not question its legality. Despite concerns, Westbury advised patience, fearing interference might harm British interests. Russell believed a blockade was effective if ships were stationed at a port's entrance to prevent access. England, a maritime power, supported the Northern blockade cautiously to protect future interests. While Confederate commissioners in London considered protesting Russell's avoidance, Mason hoped for parliamentary support. Mason met Russell unofficially, emphasizing the blockade's inefficiency. Mason left feeling Russell was inactive. Confederate representatives in Europe aimed to challenge the blockade and hoped for European support. Despite initial optimism, Mason faced a cool reception from Russell, indicating Britain's reluctance to take action. Mason hoped for parliamentary pressure to change British policy.|"[""1.

"Spence's summons to London indicated the government's concern about a potential pro-Southern move in Parliament. Spence met with key figures like Palmerston and Russell, but missed Gladstone. The prevailing sentiment in London was one of ""postponement"" due to the belief that the North would soon face financial collapse. Spence acted as an intermediary, advising against delay. Members of Parliament Gregory and Lindsay, close to Mason, advised pressing on the blockade issue due to British commercial interests. The government presented a comprehensive report on the blockade to Parliament, sparking debates challenging its effectiveness. Gregory and others argued for declaring the blockade ineffective, while opponents like Forster highlighted the blockade's impact on trade and the need for British neutrality.

Gregory's speech was cautious and aimed to maintain a judicial tone, focusing on facts. In contrast, Forster's speech exuded confidence, as if he believed his cause was already won. Henry Adams described Gregory's speech as lacking passion, comparing it to a funeral eulogy. The Solicitor-General supported the effectiveness of the blockade, countering Gregory's argument by warning of the consequences of not recognizing it. The debate highlighted the North's supporters' approval of the Government's policies towards America. The Solicitor-General's speech indicated that the motion would not succeed unless it became a partisan issue, which did not seem likely. Lord Russell upheld the legality of the blockade and predicted the end of the conflict within three months with a form of union. Southern sympathizers' efforts to change British policy backfired, leading to a firm stance in support of the blockade. Mason realized that England's support was crucial for European backing of the Confederacy.|"[""1.

During a period of amicable relations following the resolution of the _Trent_ incident, Secretary Seward saw an opportunity to push Great Britain and France to retract their Declarations of Neutrality. Encouraged by Grant's victories at Forts Henry and Donelson, Seward wrote to Adams on February 28, expressing that the United States, now able to access the interior regions of Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas, would allow trade on inland routes with restrictions. He hinted that if foreign nations withdrew their belligerent privileges to the South, the United States would further ease the blockade. However, Lyons and Mercier disagreed, stating it was premature to revoke belligerent rights. Seward also negotiated a Slave-Trade treaty with Great Britain to garner anti-slavery support, hinting at a potential Union reconstruction. The treaty aimed to enhance American credibility internationally rather than address domestic issues.|"['1.

In the same letter, Lyons discussed the Northern excitement over recent military triumphs. The campaign in the West was followed by a significant attempt in the East under McClellan to move towards Richmond via the James River peninsula, using Chesapeake Bay for transportation and supplies. This effort faced a threat from the ironclad ram _Merrimac_, which attacked wooden naval vessels supporting McClellan. However, on March 9, the _Monitor_, a slow ironclad ship, successfully repelled the _Merrimac_, removing the Southern threat. This duel between the _Merrimac_ and the _Monitor_ captivated the British people, hinting at a new era in warfare. While the British initially downplayed the _Monitor's_ victory, they soon recognized its importance as a sign of Northern resilience.

During the Civil War, news traveled slowly to England, much like McClellan's cautious advance in the peninsula. Two foreign diplomats, Mercier in Washington and Lindsay in Paris, independently sought to mediate the conflict. Mercier, representing France, aimed to end the blockade and resume trade with Europe by urging the Southern leaders to consider surrender due to their dire situation. Surprisingly, US Secretary of State Seward supported Mercier's plan, offering a conciliatory return to the Union for the South. However, British Minister Lyons was wary of this initiative, fearing a rift in the joint British-French stance.

Mr. Lyons met Mr. Mercier a few times and maintained a facade of harmony with France. Mercier returned from his trip to Richmond, recognizing the South's determination for independence.

Mercier's recent journey led him to believe that the Confederates were gearing up for a final push, bringing out their last resources and armies. If defeated, they would likely accept the terms offered. Talk of retreating inland was deemed futile. The United States taking control of the Border States and Coast would end the need for further conflict. Those opting to retreat inland were free to do so. Mercier's trip had him reiterate earlier views, advocating for early Southern recognition. However, Russell and Lyons had differing opinions, with Russell questioning the sustainability of U.S. control if small Confederate groups resisted. Seward aimed to clarify Mercier's trip through a newspaper statement, dispelling misconceptions. Napoleon's alleged involvement left many puzzled in London and Paris. Confederate agents initially believed Napoleon backed Mercier, later fearing Seward's influence. Despite mixed signals, Southern hopes were also pinned on another diplomatic incident preceding Mercier's visit to Richmond, stirring both Confederate agents and the British Ministry.|"['1.

In April, Lindsay, a British Member of Parliament, acted as a representative to Napoleon. Lindsay, a ship-owner, supported free trade and had been involved in the 1860 commercial treaty. Napoleon expressed interest in recognizing the South if Britain did. He criticized the North's blockade and sought Lindsay's help in convincing England to support his ideas. Lindsay relayed this to Cowley, who doubted the validity of Napoleon's claims. Napoleon wanted Lindsay to discuss with British opposition leaders. Cowley suspected Lindsay of pushing his own agenda. Slidell, another emissary, reported similar events to Benjamin, adding that Napoleon wanted Lindsay to meet with opposition leaders.

On April 15, Cowley, after discussing with Russell and Thouvenel, felt the need to officially inform Russell about the conversations. The report to Russell mirrored Cowley's private letter but omitted negative remarks about Lindsay. Cowley learned from Thouvenel that Emperor's views were influenced by Rouher, who was concerned about cotton supply. Lindsay's claim that Cowley agreed with him upset Cowley. Napoleon clarified that Lindsay was authorized to convey views but not proposals. Cowley expressed concerns to Russell about French preoccupation with cotton. Russell agreed on the alarming cotton situation but was unsure about the remedy. Lindsay's attempts to communicate were rebuffed, hinting at a need for official channels. Napoleon hinted at waiting for the outcome of the North's New Orleans expedition before acting. Mason found that the Paris developments did not echo in London. The news of New Orleans' capture had varied impacts on different parties. Cowley reported that the Emperor agreed to wait and watch events. Despite setbacks, Lindsay remained hopeful.|"[""1.

In the months from February to May 1862, the South faced challenges. Despite hopes in England for Tory support, Lindsay delayed pushing for it. Henry Adams noted British doubts about the South's success. The news of New Orleans changed British views, hinting at a possible shift in support towards the Federal Government. However, the anticipated victory that would solidify this support did not materialize, and attention turned to McClellan's slow progress. Rumors of foreign mediation surfaced, influenced by Mercier's confidence in the South's resilience. Lyons, though cautious, acknowledged Mercier's concerns about the war's impact on trade and cotton. The unfolding situation hinted at potential shifts in the conflict and political dynamics, with uncertainties about the war's outcome and the emergence of a Peace Party.|"['1.

In short, Lyons opposed getting involved unless there was a clear move towards peace in the North, and even then, he saw this as only a possibility. Russell, too, stuck to the established policy. He mentioned the news from York Town, New Orleans, and Corinth, hinting at potential Southern defeat. He pondered over whether the South truly desired separation or if the Union could be restored with lingering issues. Separation seemed like the only fair solution to him, but he knew the North wouldn't agree. Meanwhile, Thouvenel from France maintained strict neutrality, waiting for events to unfold. Efforts towards mediation were personal, as France and Britain hadn't taken up the idea yet, especially with Northern victories ongoing. In London, Mason summed up the situation, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the future. Southern leaders were advised to remain calm and avoid public displays against the government's inaction. Seward's attempt to retract Southern belligerent rights was met with resistance, showing a mismatch in European and American perspectives. Lyons, not taking Seward's demands too seriously, sought leave to return home, indicating a lack of immediate concern.|"[""1.

A month had passed in London without any significant news from America. While there was a belief that Richmond might fall to McClellan's army, the South's determination to resist gave hope to their British supporters. Lindsay considered making an effort in Parliament for peaceful mediation between the North and South. This idea arose due to rumors of Washington's mediation and the failure of previous motions on recognition and the blockade. However, not all supporters of the South agreed with this approach. A clash between Palmerston and Adams over General Butler's order in New Orleans caused tension. Despite misunderstandings, Adams remained composed and diplomatic in his responses, ensuring the situation did not escalate further.|"[""1.

Adams cautiously waited for a response from Britain before making any moves. Palmerston's actions might have been a tactic to relieve pressure for policy change. While there was speculation about possible shifts, Russell informed Parliament that there were no current plans for mediation. Mason's hopes were fading, but Lindsay suggested delaying the motion for Southern recognition. Slidell, desperate, considered demanding recognition from France, causing concern among Mason's advisors. Lindsay's motion was modified to avoid confrontation with the government. Lindsay postponed the motion, leading to disappointment for the Confederate agents. Slidell eventually abandoned the idea of demanding recognition, realizing their position in Europe was challenging. The situation was bleak for the Confederate representatives in Europe.|"['1.

"Stoeckl's account contradicts Mercier's claim. Stoeckl mentioned being requested to accompany Mercier but declined. He recounted a discussion with Seward, stating that the timing wasn't right for mediation. France wouldn't be accepted for this role, and if mediation was deemed acceptable, Russia would be approached instead (Russian Archives, Stoeckl to F.O., April 23-May 5, 1862, No. 927). Benjamin's report to Slidell on Mercier's visit aligns closely with Lyons' report to Russell. Benjamin's delayed communication to Slidell in July suggests little significance was attached to Mercier's visit (Richardson, II, 260. Benjamin to Slidell, July 19, 1862).

During June 1862, the Civil War in America appeared to reach a stalemate in the eyes of the English. McClellan's failed advance on Richmond by Lee marked a significant setback for the North. The Peninsular campaign was deemed a disaster, overshadowing earlier Northern victories. The progress of the campaigns in the West for the North was overlooked. The time was ripe for a strong Southern effort as Parliament's adjournment neared. By July, hopes were pinned on the cotton districts to potentially aid the Southern cause due to the increasing depression since the war's onset. The belief in the power of cotton, as the backbone of Southern wealth and influence, was deeply ingrained in Southern minds and had a significant impact on international relations, particularly with England.|"[""1.

"During the American Civil War, the South believed in the power of cotton to influence British foreign policy. However, the failure of the first Commission to Europe and British neutrality despite the lack of cotton gradually opened the eyes of the Southern states. The ""King Cotton"" theory, which suggested that England would depend on the South for cotton, was proven false as the Lancashire Cotton Famine caused serious hardships in England. About 500,000 workers in Lancashire's 2,195 cotton factories depended on the Confederate South for cotton supply. The war initially caused an accumulation of raw cotton in England, but the shortage eventually led to a rise in cotton prices, affecting the English cotton trade. Despite initial relief from trade depression, the blockade proclamation by President Lincoln further impacted the cotton trade in England."|"['1.

During the American Civil War, the impact on the English cotton trade was initially felt in Liverpool's speculative and importing markets for raw cotton. Prices surged to over a shilling a pound in October 1861. Rumors of British intervention led to a near panic on November 23, but prices rebounded in five days. However, news of the _Trent_ incident on November 27 caused market confusion, not due to hopes of increased cotton supply but fears of war with America. The blockade from the South halted cotton supply, with only 11,500 bales received in six months. The situation led to pressure on the government for action to secure cotton. Despite the unexpected wealth in the cotton trade, manufacturers prospered from rising prices. The cotton industry was saved from disaster, and profits increased due to the inflated price of stocks on hand.|"['1.

During the mid-1800s, Lancashire faced a severe crisis due to a shortage in cotton supply. This led to many factory workers losing their jobs and relying on public aid or private charity for basic needs. The number of people needing assistance increased rapidly, reaching over 550,000 individuals at one point. Despite the distress, there was no starvation as the community came together to support those in need. While discussions arose about government intervention to secure more cotton, the majority sympathized with the North during the war and did not pressure the Cabinet for action. The crisis also sparked conversations about finding alternative sources of cotton and adapting to the changing circumstances. Overall, the Lancashire community showed resilience and unity during this challenging time.|['1.

Bright's letter in November 1861 was penned before England received news about the _Trent_, while the one in January 1862 was written just after the matter was peacefully resolved. The _Trent_ issue diverted focus from cotton and led to a commitment to maintain neutrality. Despite the threat of war, there was no significant pressure on the Government for cotton. Hopes arose in 1862 with Northern victories, hinting at an end to the conflict or capturing cotton areas to aid England. Seward's assurances post the capture of New Orleans initially eased concerns, but by mid-1862, challenges in securing territories behind the city and the South's decision to burn cotton rather than let it be taken by the enemy hindered significant supply from the Mississippi valley. This wasn't an immediate worry as both the Government and manufacturers believed that the distress wasn't solely due to a lack of cotton. The public blamed America for Lancashire's suffering, while the Cotton Lords didn't reveal the true causes. The debate in May 1862 focused solely on the war as the reason for distress, with no mention of changing British neutral policy. The distress in Lancashire was manageable at the time, and the Government's focus was on promoting infrastructure in India rather than addressing the cotton crisis. The destruction of cotton by the South and the lack of criticism of Northern policies by British officials until August 1862 showed that the distress in England wasn't solely due to cotton shortages.

Persigny subtly informed Slidell about private instructions from Napoleon to Thouvenel, who was visiting London. Napoleon wanted England to recognize the South, but Palmerston had already opposed this in Parliament. Despite rumors, Thouvenel believed interfering in America was risky and would not be well-received by British officials. Southern hopes rose due to knowledge of Napoleon's desires. Amid distress in Lancashire, Lyons in London feared mainly for cotton, not an immediate clash with America. The debate on July 18 aimed to sway the Ministry in favor of the South. Lindsay argued for mediation, citing Lancashire's plight. Pro-Southern speakers highlighted Lancashire's distress, urging recognition for the Southern states. However, Forster warned that mediation might prolong the war and worsen English commercial troubles. Ultimately, Palmerston opposed the motion to avoid taking sides prematurely and risking future interventions.|"[""1.

"Lindsay's efforts on July 18 seemed unsuccessful on the surface. Lyons described it as ""ill-timed,"" unsure of the disaster's extent to McClellan. The parliamentary debate hinted at support for mediation, causing Lyons to fear Mercier's push for it. Henry Adams shared the sentiment, believing interference was inevitable if they remained in Virginia by July. Slidell's actions hinted at France's potential separate action, offering deals without authority. Slidell's persistence in seeking French action conflicted with advice to follow Britain.

The ongoing conflict needs to stop. The South has shown unity and determination, but reopening ports like New Orleans hasn't brought any relief. The distress in manufacturing areas could pressure the government. In Parliament, there were sneers at cotton manufacturers in Lancashire. Mason's appeal for recognition from Russell mirrored Lindsay's arguments. Britain is waiting for a clear sign of Southern independence. Gladstone felt a decision should be made soon to end the horrors of war. Lord Campbell's motion for Russell's correspondence with Mason was denied. Russell reaffirmed Britain's neutrality, emphasizing harmony with France. Mason suspected lies but hoped for clarity from France. However, France showed less interest in the South due to disturbances in Italy, dampening hopes for recognition.|"['1. What is the main concern expressed in the text passage?\nA.

In August, Parliament adjourned after passing an Act to help the distressed in Lancashire by giving more power to the Poor Law Guardians. Pro-Northern groups in London believed the Southern push for a change in British policy had failed. Despite Russell hinting at future action, many saw it as a gesture to the South. Both Southern and Northern circles outside the Cabinet were unaware that the Ministry was leaning towards mediation. The North faced setbacks as McClellan was removed, and the Northern army retreated from Virginia. Stuart reported that hopes of obtaining cotton seemed bleak and the peace party was losing ground. The British Ministry's hopes for Northern weariness of the war were fading. Argyll wrote to Gladstone about the North's determination, indicating that mediation was not yet possible. The British Ministry was surprised by the renewed Northern energy, which led to a shift towards mediation.|"['1.

Mercier's idea of taking action in October aligns with your own thoughts. I will return to England before October, and then we can discuss it further. However, the war may lose momentum before that time. An intriguing book titled _Cotton is King, and Pro-Slavery Arguments_ was released in Augusta, Georgia, in 1860. It compiled works by Southern scholars defending slavery from various perspectives like political economy, ethics, and law. This publication aimed to justify slavery, highlight cotton's significance, and argue that the U.S.'s power rested on controlling the cotton supply. The editor, E.N. Elliot, was the President of Planters' College in Mississippi. Additionally, a letter from Bunch to Russell in December 1860 revealed the importance of cotton in diplomatic negotiations. The South's heavy reliance on cotton was evident when Col. Gorgas urgently sought three ironworkers from England due to a lack of industrial diversity beyond staple products.|"[""1.

"During the Civil War in America, there was a misconception in England that the cotton disaster was solely due to the war. However, it was later understood that the famine was also caused by oversupply. In a debate in June 1862, speakers like Egerton, Potter, Villiers, and Bright discussed the distress in the manufacturing districts without criticizing America. Orders for cotton were described as including ""foreign-owned"" cotton, purchased by British citizens for export. Despite the challenges, the English resolved to uphold their laws and not recognize any side until the war ended. This stance was maintained even when faced with the temptation to engage in conflict with America, a decision deemed more serious than the Mexican adventure."|"['1.

Public opinion restricts the Government from favoring the North over the South, emphasizing the need for strict neutrality. Any strong provocation from the U.S. could challenge even maintaining this stance. In a letter dated July 18, 1862, Henry Adams advised his son that securing a supply of cotton for England before winter would be a monumental service surpassing diplomatic efforts in a century. Despite skepticism, Adams highlighted the significance of this potential achievement. Additionally, Gregory humorously shared an excerpt from the _Dubuque Sun_ advocating debt repudiation to England, showcasing different perspectives on financial morality. Slidell's communication with Mason, detailed in a letter dated July 25, 1862, involved offering special commercial advantages to France, with Mason initially unaware until receiving instructions on July 30. The complexity of diplomatic interactions during this time underscored the delicate balance of international relations.|"['1.

The British Parliament adjourned on August 7 without showing any interest in getting involved in the American Civil War. While many Britons believed this meant the government would stay out of the conflict, some observers, like Motley in Vienna, were more cautious. Motley had been closely following the situation in England and predicted that the government's resistance to getting involved wouldn't last long. The establishment of a pro-Southern weekly called _The Index_ also pushed for British intervention to end the war. The publication highlighted France's favor with the South and criticized British hesitance. Even though there were speculations and agitations, there was no concrete evidence of the British government's intentions. The American Minister, Adams, also expressed concerns about British neutrality and the potential change in policy. He received specific instructions on how to respond if Britain proposed mediation or intervention. The period was marked by uncertainty and caution on both sides of the conflict.|"[""1.

The North's firm decision to resist European interference showed Seward and Lincoln's readiness for armed opposition to foreign involvement. Adams knew the stance and awaited the outcome. The details were shared with Forster, who had connections to the Cabinet. Although the American resolve may not have been officially conveyed to the Ministry, it was likely communicated. Russell's letter of August 6 marked their determination date. They awaited advice from Washington to act. Stuart suggested October for action, favoring direct recognition of the Confederacy over mediation, believing it would avoid conflict. Russell, however, was skeptical of Stuart's change in approach. Russell's proactive move on September 13 involved instructing Cowley to discreetly gauge Thouvenel's stance. Palmerston also considered mediation or recognizing Southern independence. The unofficial approach to France was met with caution, awaiting Northern election results. Thouvenel warned of repercussions if England and France recognized the South.|"['1.

Russell and Palmerston were contemplating a diplomatic move regarding the American Civil War. Russell had proposed an armistice without mediation, hoping to gain the support of other European powers. Thouvenel's lack of enthusiasm did not deter Russell, as he knew of disagreements between Thouvenel and Napoleon III. Russell believed that Napoleon III could be swayed if England gave the signal. Another factor was the conflict within the French government over Italian policy, potentially leading to Thouvenel's exclusion. Russell's plan involved offering mediation to both the North and South, with recognition of the South if the North refused. Despite initial approval from Palmerston, there was opposition within the Cabinet, as Granville argued against the proposed course of action.|"[""1.

In Granville's letter, he discusses the Civil War in America and the potential for European mediation. The recent battles near Washington and Lee's retreat after the Battle of Antietam are mentioned. Palmerston considers offering mediation based on the South's acceptance of separation. He believes the North might refuse as they are fighting for different principles. Palmerston also contemplates the timing of European involvement based on the war's progress. He suggests that England and France could propose negotiations for separation to avoid prolonged hostilities. However, there are concerns about the North's reaction to recognizing Southern independence. Palmerston and Russell are cautious, considering the military events and potential consequences of involvement.

Russell, the British Foreign Secretary, was concerned about France's response to their proposed plans, especially with the ongoing crisis in the French Ministry over the Italian issue. Despite assurances from Russell, there were doubts among his colleagues. The situation escalated when Gladstone's speech in Newcastle suggested recognizing the Confederacy as a nation. This unexpected declaration caused a stir and hinted at potential shifts in British policy towards the American Civil War. The public perceived Gladstone's words as a signal of imminent government action, although he spoke without official approval. Russell's initial intentions for mediation seemed to waver, influenced by the evolving circumstances both domestically and internationally.

The stock market, a reflection of government actions, experienced sudden changes after Gladstone's speech, hinting at potential war involvement. Cotton prices fell sharply, causing concern among Southern supporters. Bright, a Northern ally, hoped Gladstone's words were to spur action rather than mere persuasion. Newspapers initially approved but soon grew wary of unclear policies. Within the Cabinet, Gladstone's unconventional speech stirred debate. Despite Russell's displeasure, he proposed an armistice, highlighting the South's resilience and the North's flawed emancipation plan. Lewis, opposing any deviation from neutrality, publicly challenged the Cabinet's undecided stance. Meanwhile, Palmerston sought advice from Derby, who advised against recognition or mediation due to the ongoing war's uncertain outcome. Lewis, close to Clarendon, responded to Russell's memo, aligning with the facts but questioning the practicality of proposed actions.|"[""1.

A neutral observer might agree with Lord Russell's historical perspective and wish for a peaceful end to the war between the conflicting sides. However, decisions on proposals from the English Government are influenced by passionate partisans rather than unbiased bystanders. The focus should not be on how philosophers or calm individuals would perceive the proposals but on how they would be received by the intended audience. Lincoln's emancipation proclamation, although possibly aiming to incite conflict, actually highlighted the deep bitterness that hindered rational discussions. Any action by Britain other than strict neutrality was deemed risky. Statesmanship required caution and a consideration of potential consequences. Despite differing views within the British Cabinet, the prevailing sentiment was to maintain a stance of neutrality and observe the war's course before taking further action.|"['1.

G. Lewis proposed a plan for England, France, and other major European powers to request America to pause the war. However, this proposal was not initially considered by Russell, who believed that all five powers needed to be involved for it to work. Despite some shifting positions, Russell maintained that he had always contemplated a joint action by the five great powers of Europe. In response to Lewis' interpretation, Russell denied having specific plans and emphasized the need for Cabinet approval. The situation was closely monitored by individuals like Clarendon, who commended Lewis for highlighting the potential pitfalls of intervening in the American conflict prematurely. While there were differing opinions within the Cabinet, the French ministerial crisis added another layer of complexity to the diplomatic landscape.

"On October 27, Cowley discussed American affairs with the Emperor Napoleon, who proposed a joint mediation by England, France, and Russia. However, Cowley had no instructions. Napoleon then suggested a six-month armistice to calm the current tensions. The next day, Cowley reported that Drouyn de Lhuys mentioned the Emperor's desire to end the war but was unsure about the timing. If America rejected overtures, Russia might not join England and France in recognizing the South. Napoleon quickly moved to push the French plan. On October 28, Slidell was informed of the Emperor's plan for an armistice with England. By October 31, Cowley received official instructions from Drouyn de Lhuys to propose a six-month armistice, including suspending the blockade to open Southern ports to European trade. There were concerns about how the North and South would react to proposals regarding slavery and runaway slaves. Russell wanted the British Cabinet to discuss the French plan, emphasizing the importance of offering credible mediation.

Upon receiving news of Napoleon's proposal, the Cabinet faced a renewed crisis, more intense than before. The French offer was officially presented on November 10. Over the next two days, the Cabinet extensively debated the response to be given. Lord John expressed his belief that supporting the Democrats due to recent successes could be beneficial and advised accepting France's proposal. However, the Cabinet dissected the proposal, with most members criticizing it for being too favorable to the South. Ultimately, despite some initial support, the Cabinet decided against being involved. Lord Russell's handling of the United States affair was criticized for not standing firm. The French may make the rejection public, but there is hope for future collaboration. Lord Palmerston's support was seen as weak.|"['1.

The immediate response to France's proposal was made public in both France and England. It praised the Emperor's intentions but highlighted the need for Russia's cooperation, which was uncertain at the time. The British Cabinet, led by Russell, initially believed Russia's support was crucial but later learned Russia would refuse. This knowledge influenced the British decision to decline the proposal, with public opinion in England largely supporting this stance. While some journals criticized the Cabinet's choice, others defended it, emphasizing the importance of avoiding interference in the American conflict. The _Herald_ expressed disbelief in the rumored decision, while the _Army and Navy Gazette_ warned of potential consequences of the Northern States' victory. Overall, the British Ministry's decision was met with mixed reactions, with some questioning the government's reluctance to act.|"[""1.

_The Index_ was steadfast in its belief that within the Cabinet, Russell was viewed as the primary adversary of the South. Slidell, who was better informed, expressed surprise at Russell's support for accepting the Emperor's proposal, apart from Gladstone. Napoleon was upset as he expected his proposal to be accepted, possibly leading France to act independently. Gladstone's stance disappointed many, with Bright thinking he had moved away from seeking mediation. Goldwin Smith, however, knew of Gladstone's idea to offer Canada to the North in exchange for letting the South secede. England's decision not to intervene in America pleased the public and the Government. Lyons, upon arriving in America, found opposition to mediation, especially from the Conservatives. The Northern press rejected foreign aid, showing no gratitude to England, blaming Napoleon III instead. Seward and Adams accepted Britain's unchanged policy after the answer to France in November. Seward's calm approach to foreign affairs led to a Cabinet controversy, but Lincoln's intervention prevented Seward's resignation. British diplomats, including Lyons, developed a better understanding and respect for Seward over time.|"[""1.

In August 1862, Stoeckl advised against European mediation in the American Civil War, fearing it would worsen the situation. He believed waiting until the next spring was best. Lyons, the British ambassador, also cautioned against mediation without being prepared for war. Mercier, a French diplomat, was eager for action, hoping France's involvement would force the United States to yield. However, Stoeckl disagreed, stating that mediation would only work if backed by force to open Southern ports. In October, Russell proposed inviting France and Russia to join England in offering peace services to the U.S., with hopes of Russian support. Granville's opposition and the Queen's likely disapproval, along with the necessity to act before Parliament reconvened, influenced the decision-making process. Russia, however, maintained its stance of extreme friendship towards the United States.|"[""1.

Bright wrote to Sumner on October 10, 1862, expressing his initial doubts about the emancipation proclamation. The _Times_ initially viewed Gladstone's speech as a governmental stance, with the _Morning Post_ praising Gladstone's northern tour but avoiding mention of his views on America. Gladstone clarified to Russell on October 17 that his words were not an official statement, to which Russell responded on October 20, expressing concerns about negotiations with Jeff Davis. Palmerston's memorandum included texts of the emancipation proclamation and Lincoln's response to abolitionists. The _Education of Henry Adams_ and other sources recount a tradition about Lewis receiving instructions, but later evidence suggests Lewis acted independently.

In 1862, there was a disagreement among British politicians regarding speeches made by Gladstone and Lewis. Palmerston and Clarendon criticized Gladstone's speech for going against tradition. Clarendon also mentioned that Lewis' speech faced similar objections. Meanwhile, the newspaper, _The Index_, warned against interpreting Gladstone's words as government policy. Additionally, there were reports about British subjects allegedly being drafted into the Northern Army during the American Civil War. Palmerston's newspaper, the _Morning Post_, criticized Gladstone and Lewis. However, Adams, the American Minister, understood Russell's assurance of maintaining neutrality positively. The _Index_ criticized the British Ministry for inaction during a time of crisis. Morley clarified that a final decision was not made on October 23, as previously believed. There were discussions about mediation and non-intervention, with some confusion about dates related to Napoleon's armistice talks.|"['1.

In 1862, during the Civil War in America, France and Russia were approached for peace mediation. France hesitated, and Russia, while friendly with the United States, did not want to pressure them. England and France considered offering mediation, but Russia, being far away, would likely not join. Instead, Russia might offer moral support. The goal was to encourage the North and South to agree to end the war. France's offer was seen as a first step towards mediation, though it was not a direct mediation proposal. The French Minister of Foreign Affairs was upset by an article on the peace overtures. These events show the delicate diplomacy involved in trying to end the conflict.|"['1.

In December 1862, there was a discussion between England and Russia about not jointly offering mediation to the United States. France's proposal was seen as premature by Britain. Later, Slidell in Paris suggested France should recognize the South separately. Napoleon III offered mediation but did not mention an armistice or recognition of the South. Russia also considered offering mediation. Lyons in England preferred that the conflict be resolved without English intervention. France made an isolated offer to the US, which was declined. Britain maintained a neutral stance, not interfering in the Civil War. The British government's decision was supported in Parliament, emphasizing the need for strict neutrality until certain conditions were met.

During the American Civil War, the British Parliament and Cabinet were united in their stance against interfering in American affairs. They based this position on their neutral duty and national interests, paying little attention to the North's new policy on slavery. Despite the North's clear determination to abolish slavery, as declared in the emancipation proclamations of 1862 and 1863, British opinion and actions remained largely unaffected. Early on, British sympathy lay with the North due to its free society, but as the war progressed and trade interests were disrupted, opinions shifted. The fear of a possible servile insurrection in America, sparked by the abolition of slavery, was a prevalent concern in British discussions. While some believed in the necessity of emancipation to end the war, others feared the consequences of such a move, including the potential for a slave uprising. Overall, the British press and officials grappled with the complexities of the Civil War and its implications on slavery and the future of America.|"[""1.

"Lincoln, not an ""Abolitionist,"" had long foreseen that slavery would become a crucial issue during the Civil War. Despite his primary goal of reuniting the Union, Lincoln understood the growing anti-slavery sentiment. In 1862, Congress debated the ""Confiscation Bill,"" proposing the freedom of slaves from those in rebellion against the United States. Initially hesitant due to border state loyalty, Lincoln eventually supported the gradual emancipation. The conflict between Congress and the President over emancipation methods persisted until September when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. Facing opposition from border states and Cabinet members, Lincoln delayed the proclamation until a Northern victory seemed imminent. Ultimately, the proclamation warned of general emancipation if rebellious states did not return to the Union by January 1, 1863."|"[""1.

In September, McClellan's victory over Lee at Antietam marked a turning point. Lincoln issued a proclamation on September 22, 1862, promising steps to persuade loyal border states towards voluntary action. On January 1, 1863, a second proclamation declared all slaves in designated states free. The purpose of the emancipation proclamation was to weaken the South economically and bolster the North's military strength by enlisting freed slaves. Lincoln's motive was not to incite a servile insurrection but to shift the balance of power. The proclamation aimed to demonstrate a moral cause to foreign nations. Despite British interests, the North's anti-slavery stance was pivotal. Even before the war, Southern intentions to revive the African Slave Trade were known. The North's actions regarding slavery influenced British opinion and support for the Union cause.|"[""1.

During the American Civil War, England had mixed opinions on the North's approach to slavery. While some English publications like the _Times_ criticized the North for not taking a strong stance against slavery, others like the _Spectator_ believed that the North needed to make it clear that the restoration of the Union did not mean the continuation of slavery. Officially, England held the view that the separation of the North and South would eventually lead to the end of slavery in the South. Despite the North's efforts to suppress the African Slave Trade, England viewed these actions as weak attempts to gain sympathy rather than genuine anti-slavery efforts. The London Emancipation Society was founded to protest England's perceived support for the South, emphasizing the importance of the anti-slavery cause in the Civil War. Lincoln was advised by some to issue an emancipation proclamation to clarify the North's stance on slavery and prevent foreign intervention, but there is little evidence to suggest that he did so to correct the foreign view.|"[""1.

"After the enactment of the ""confiscation bill"" in July 1862, pressure mounted on President Lincoln to issue a general proclamation of emancipation. In a famous reply to Greeley on August 22, 1862, Lincoln reiterated his sole aim to reunite the Union ""with or without slavery."" Despite appearing to avoid moral questions, a drafted emancipation proclamation was already in discussion within the Cabinet. Greeley and a delegation of Chicago clergymen pressed for abolitionist demands to unite the North and gain European sympathy. Lincoln, while acknowledging the potential benefits of emancipation abroad, was cautious about the repercussions. Seward, the Secretary of State, used the threat of servile insurrection tied to emancipation to deter European intervention, believing that economic interests would influence foreign policy. Lincoln's actions were strategic, aiming to prevent foreign intervention and secure Northern victory in the Civil War."|"['1.

On July 13, Lincoln informed Seward and Welles about the planned emancipation proclamation, marking the first time he discussed it. Seward responded positively but wanted time to fully consider the proposal. The next day, he sent a copy of the Bill introduced in Congress to agents overseas, outlining Lincoln's gradual emancipation plan. This swift action was unusual. Seward forwarded the Bill without much commentary, indicating it aligned better with his views on slavery concerning foreign relations than an immediate proclamation of emancipation. Meanwhile, concerns grew in America about potential shifts in British neutral policy. Adams reported on July 11 that the British Cabinet might take a new stance soon, adding to Seward's hesitance to issue the proclamation. Despite Seward's arguments against immediate action, Lincoln decided to delay. Seward's approach aimed to prevent foreign intervention by threatening a servile war, emphasizing a materialistic perspective. His views resonated with initial responses from government circles abroad, particularly in England. Stuart's remarks reflected concerns that a servile war would only prolong the conflict, prompting other nations to seek a resolution. Russell echoed similar sentiments, cautioning against the destructive implications of a servile war. Both Seward and Russell viewed emancipation as a potential trigger for servile insurrection, which could invite foreign intervention. Seward saw the threat of servile war as strategic, but the actual event could pose risks for the North. On the other hand, American diplomats like Adams and Motley believed that a|"['1.

"During the Civil War, the issue of emancipation was a contentious one. Secretary of State Seward initially focused on the material interests of European powers, fearing their interference if the North freed the slaves. However, diplomats like Adams emphasized the moral importance of the issue. Eventually, Seward shifted his stance to emphasize a ""high moral purpose"" behind the Emancipation Proclamation. Despite initial doubts and opposition, the proclamation aimed to show the South that their true interests lay in preserving the Union. Seward even proposed allowing liberated slaves to be transported to British colonies for labor, showing concern for both humanitarian and strategic interests. The proclamation faced criticism in England, with fears of inciting servile insurrections and disrupting industry.

The _Edinburgh Review_ called it a ""cry of despair,"" while _Blackwood's_ deemed it ""monstrous"" and provoking war without mercy.

"In America, the Emancipation Proclamation faced mixed reactions despite support from abolitionists. Lincoln felt disheartened due to public skepticism and McClellan's failure to capitalize on the victory at Antietam. The elections of October and November turned against the administration, citing the President's concessions to radicals. The army viewed the proclamation as insignificant, labeling it as mere ""waste paper."" In England, John Bright initially hesitated to fully endorse the proclamation, criticizing the South for slavery. However, public opinion gradually shifted in favor of emancipation by December. Public meetings and resolutions across Britain expressed solidarity with the Northern cause and condemned slavery. Despite some editorial opposition, the British public increasingly supported Lincoln's efforts, viewing the cause as just and moral.

"Eight years ago, half a million English women united to speak out against slavery to America. Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" responded to this call and asked for support from her English sisters. A letter signed by many English women assured her of their continued opposition to slavery and rejection of any British support for the South. Working-class Britons also voiced their support for the North. Abraham Lincoln, in a letter dated January 19, 1863, thanked the people of Manchester for their unwavering support during the hardships caused by the war. Nonconformist churches in England rallied behind the North, with prominent figures like Spurgeon leading prayers for the North's victory.

"In 1862, shortly after the release of Spence's _American Union_, which had sparked interest in England and influenced upper-class opinions in favor of the South, Cairnes wrote ""Slave Power."" This pamphlet analyzed slavery's foundation and challenged Spence's views. Cairnes predicted England's infatuation with the slave power would be short-lived. His pamphlet gained traction, especially among those previously neutral, seeking a logical basis for supporting the North after the emotional reception of the emancipation proclamation. Even in official circles, sentiments once private were now public. Lincoln's resolution hoped for no recognition of a new nation built on slavery.

In 1862, Adams communicated with Seward about mediation efforts, with Cobden involved. Seward's influence lessened due to signing the Abolition Proclamation against his views.

During the American Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Lincoln had significant global implications. British agents doubted its practical impact but warned that if enforced, cotton cultivation would be severely affected. European nations, like France, considered the risk of slave uprisings due to the proclamation. In Britain, public opinion was divided, with some sympathizing with the North and others advocating for Southern recognition.

The construction of Confederate war vessels like the _Alabama_ in British ports and the subsequent controversies have been extensively studied from legal, diplomatic, and international law perspectives. The focus here is on examining the key incidents related to Southern ship-building in British yards at that time. The intentions of the British Government hold more significance in this analysis than the correctness of its actions. In 1860, the issue of a belligerent's right to obtain or build warships in neutral nations was not clearly defined in international law. The British Foreign Enlistment Act of 1861 prohibited British subjects from aiding belligerents in any ship-related activities. However, the Act had a loophole as it required proof of the offense after it had been committed, making it challenging to prevent violations. The South, lacking a navy, sought advice from British lawyers and carefully followed the Foreign Enlistment Act to construct war vessels in British yards without violating neutrality laws. Captain J.D. Bullock was a key figure in this process, ensuring strict adherence to the law. The steamer _Oreto_ cleared from Liverpool in 1862 with a declared destination but was later reported to be completing its equipment as a Southern war vessel. The _Alabama_, equipped with British guns and crew, operated as a commerce destroyer, capturing and destroying Northern merchant ships. The North viewed the _Alabama_'s actions with growing resentment, questioning British neutrality.|['1.

During a Senate discussion about a privateering bill in 1863, Senator Grimes introduced the bill to encourage privateers to pursue British ships expected to support the Confederates. However, Senator Sumner objected, stating that privateers should focus on destroying enemy commerce, which the South lacked. Despite opposition, the bill was passed in the Senate and later in the House of Representatives. The purpose was to counter the building of Confederate ships in England to break the blockade. In the midst of this, the British government was considering amending the Foreign Enlistment Act to prevent similar incidents. Secretary Seward assured the British government that the privateering bill aimed to address the threat posed by Confederate vessels built in England, but it raised concerns about its impact on neutral commerce.

In late March, tensions escalated between the United States and Great Britain. Adams, the American envoy, worked tirelessly for peace, but both sides accused each other of neglecting neutral duties. Meanwhile, in Washington, the Cabinet debated issuing letters of marque and reprisal against British actions. Seward, awaiting news from England, delayed a decision. In London, public opinion clashed over Britain's neutral stance, with Russell showing signs of doubt. Rumors circulated about Russian naval aid to the North, adding to the uncertainty. In England, growing discontent over the _Alabama_ issue led to calls for action against Confederate ships. Liverpool, once supportive of Southern ship-building, began to question the Ministry's handling of the situation. Russell's wavering stance hinted at potential shifts in Britain's approach.|"[""1.

Adams suggested that the government should disapprove of building warships like the _Alabama_ to attack American ships. However, the parliamentary debate did not support this idea. Bright, a strong advocate for the North, criticized the government for being neutral and urged support for the democratic North. The public meeting on March 26, where Bright spoke, highlighted the rising demand for democratic values. The debate on March 27 focused on the violation of the Foreign Enlistment Act, with Forster demanding explanations from the Ministers. However, the government defended its actions, accusing America of unjustified allegations. Laird, defending his firm's actions, criticized Bright for promoting class division. Ultimately, the government did not pledge any action against Southern shipbuilding, despite the debate's intensity.|['1.

Adams felt let down by the debate's outcome, believing it undermined Lord Russell's speech rather than supported it. He and his English advisors were uncertain whether to trust Russell's hints of more active government efforts or accept that Palmerston had dismissed his advice. Despite their anxiety, they failed to realize that the delay in announcing a new policy didn't mean the old one would continue. The pressure on the government came from America's threat to deploy privateers if their demands weren't met. Russell's reaction to the debate was indifferent, as he ordered the detention of suspicious ironclads. The seizure of the _Alexandra_ marked a shift in policy, with public support for preventing further ship-building for the South. Russell's change in stance was driven by concerns over American privateering and the need to counter the South's blockade-breaking ships.|"[""1.

During the Civil War, Russell, a British diplomat, feared the American plan could harm British trade and lead to war. Seward, the American Secretary of State, hinted at using privateers against British ships. Russell, alarmed, asked for explanations and prepared naval instructions to protect British commerce. Lyons, the British Minister, worried about escalating tensions and the possibility of war with the U.S. He believed Seward's actions were driven by political motives. Despite initial concerns, Seward's conciliatory response to British protests calmed tensions. The crisis peaked in March-April 1863 over Southern ship-building in Britain. Seward's efforts to improve relations with Britain in August contrasted with the usual historical focus on the threat of war. The Laird Rams incident, involving British-built ships for the Confederacy, highlights the importance of British reactions to American plans during the Civil War.|"[""1.

In England, public opinion turned against Southern ship-building. Ship-owners in Liverpool urged changes to prevent Southern ships being issued from neutral ports. The ship-owners feared British commerce would suffer if England became a belligerent. The ship-owners found it disgraceful that British law was being publicly violated. The under-secretary, Hammond, claimed the law was sufficient if proof of intent to violate it was found. Ship-owners, distinct from ship-builders, were alarmed. Attention shifted to the trial of the _Alexandra_, where a decision against the Government was appealed, causing anxiety among Northern and Southern agents. Rumors about the Rams' ownership were spread, but evidence for seizure was hard to obtain. Diplomatic tensions rose, with threats of war hinted at by both sides. Adams presented evidence to urge the immediate seizure of the Rams, fearing British involvement in the war if they escaped. The government hesitated to act due to the lack of concrete evidence.|"['1.

Russell was criticized for delaying the seizure of the Rams, which were intended for use as warships against the United States. Adams, the American Minister, was initially dissatisfied with the delay and criticized the law officers of the Crown. However, once informed by Russell about the situation, Adams was pleased with the firm action taken. British officials and diplomats were also pleased with the seizure of the Rams, which occurred in mid-October after being under surveillance since September 9. Despite some opposition in Britain, the Government's decision was generally supported. Legal opinions were against the seizure, prompting Adams to press for changes in British law or a mutual agreement on neutral duties with America. The Government defended its actions, emphasizing that they aimed for honest neutrality. Opposition parties in Britain criticized Russell for allegedly yielding to American threats, but the Government defended its decisions.|"[""1.

In the mid-1800s, the issue of neutral countries building and arming ships for warring nations was unclear. An example of this confusion occurred during the Texan war of independence against Mexico in 1843. Mexico contracted two warships from an English firm, with British naval officers on leave to command them and British-made guns. The British Foreign Secretary, Aberdeen, initially allowed the ships to be fully equipped. However, when Texas objected, Aberdeen changed his stance, allowing only one ship to sail as planned while the other had to be stripped of its equipment. British confusion on neutrality in such cases was evident, with some officials supporting Mexico while others were unsure of the correct course of action. This historical event sheds light on the complexities of international relations and neutrality.|"['1.

In a historic case from the 1860s, a government seizure was deemed unwarranted in court. The government appealed the decision, but the Court of Exchequer upheld it. Subsequent appeals led to the government's defeat in the House of Lords in 1864. Around the same time, discussions on international law, including the right to conduct blockades, were ongoing. There were concerns about privateers capturing British vessels due to allegations of breaching blockades or carrying contraband. Diplomatic correspondence revealed tensions and misinterpretations between the US and Great Britain, with fears of escalating conflicts. The government's refusal to disclose certain correspondence led to speculations and debates in Parliament.|"[""1.

During September 1863, there was a significant crisis involving the Rams, ironclad ships built by the Confederates. Adams, feeling anxious, believed the crisis peaked in September, but historical evidence suggests the real decision-making moment for the government occurred in April. The British government finally seized the Iron Clads, causing tension with the Americans. Despite doubts about the legality of the seizure, the British were confident in their actions. The Foreign Office believed they had prevented a violent attempt to get the ships to sea. The South had already expelled British consuls by October 1863, leading to further diplomatic tensions.|['1.

During the mid-1800s, the British Government faced pressure from pro-Southern groups seeking Confederacy recognition. The seizure of the ship Alexandra led to uncertainty about the government's stance. Public support for the North waned, and Southern sympathizers regained confidence. Roebuck emerged as a new advocate for the South. Despite initial reluctance, the South's supporters believed in the possibility of a separate North and South. Even neutral observers like historian Freeman and novelist Trollope acknowledged the likely division. The government's decision against intervention in 1862 was not final, prompting Southern agents to consider rallying Tory support against the government. The _Index_ noted the government's reluctance to interfere, hinting at a potential shift in policy. Southern advocates were strategizing to sway the Conservatives for their cause.|"[""1.

"The plan to seek support from the Tories did not gain much traction initially and showed no immediate progress during the parliamentary debate on February 5, 1863. Derby supported the Government's decision to reject Napoleon's proposals. Russell, having recovered from Cabinet setbacks, expressed weariness with ongoing mediation talks and emphasized the need for both sides to tire of the conflict before considering peace efforts. The House of Commons was against taking any immediate action, fearing it would be futile for the South and might strain relations with the North. Southern efforts to influence the British government were temporarily stalled, leading to a shift towards financial strategies. The Confederate Cotton Loan aimed to raise funds for Southern agents in Europe and garner support for the South. Financial challenges plagued the Confederacy, hindering its operations both domestically and abroad. Efforts to establish credit in England faced obstacles due to the depreciation of Confederate currency. Initially, drafts were issued through Fraser, Trenholm & Company, but as Confederate money lost value, alternative methods were explored, including using cotton as collateral. Despite various attempts to secure funds, the Confederacy struggled with financial instability, prompting the consideration of a formal ""cotton loan"" in Europe."|"['1.

In 1862, a proposal was brought to Paris by Erlanger & Company, a well-known firm. Initially, Slidell consulted Mason, who was preoccupied with his plans alongside Spence. Despite this, Slidell persisted, and Mason eventually relented. Erlanger's representatives proposed a $25 million loan to the Confederate Government, but the government was hesitant about foreign loans. Eventually, a reduced $15 million agreement was reached due to the belief that it would garner support for the South. The contract was signed in Richmond on January 28, 1863, with a secret act of Congress following the next day. Despite initial reservations, the loan was pursued for political reasons. The operation was delayed until March 18 due to paperwork delays. The bonds were put on the market in London, Liverpool, Paris, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt on March 19.

Unfortunately, the King faced turmoil as his throne began to shake, requiring all his resources to maintain his position. The loan that had sparked excitement was now struggling, causing concern among promoters and diplomats. Adams was suspected of supporting the bonds, and tensions rose as Spence and Erlanger & Company clashed over market stabilization methods. Eventually, Mason reluctantly allowed funds to be used to buoy the bonds, fearing the loan's collapse. Despite efforts to prop up the loan, it failed to generate significant revenue for the Confederacy.

In an attempt to prevent any errors from the telegraph, I am clarifying that M. Mocquard's note is confidential and should not be utilized. Although shared with Messrs. Roebuck and Lindsay, it should remain confidential. Roebuck sought information from Baron Gros and learned that no formal communication had been made to Russell regarding Napoleon's desires. Lord Campbell questioned Russell in the House of Lords, revealing discrepancies between accounts. Roebuck's motion urged the Queen to negotiate with foreign powers for Confederate recognition, citing benefits to England. However, the debate revealed contradictions and lack of evidence to support claims. The debate highlighted the complexities of diplomacy and the risks of involvement in the war, leading to calls for continued British neutrality. Ultimately, the debate underscored the importance of accurate information and cautious decision-making in foreign affairs.|"[""1. What is the main purpose of M.

I received your note on the 29th of last month. In today's newspapers, the debate in the House from last night, which I attended, is detailed. Lord Russell's response to Lord Campbell in the House of Lords regarding the French situation remains unclear. Without the Emperor clarifying his intentions in writing, we can't fully understand his true motives or benefit from his private revelations. The public opinion is that the Emperor speaks differently in private versus to his ambassador in England. The debate will resume tomorrow, with Lindsay providing further explanation. The _Times_ and the _Economist_ both opposed premature recognition of the Confederacy, emphasizing the need for force to back any actions. Roebuck's motion faced criticism and doubts about its success, with concerns about its impact on relations between Britain, France, and the North. Palmerston, back in the House on July 6, aimed to avoid further debate on Napoleon's involvement, urging Roebuck to drop the matter to maintain good relations between France and England.|"[""1.

The following day in the Commons, Sir James Ferguson asked Roebuck to drop his motion due to the uncertain situation in America. Palmerston agreed, suggesting that personal matters should not be discussed in the House. Despite Palmerston's efforts, Lindsay continued the debate, advising Roebuck to postpone the motion. The debate continued with criticisms of Roebuck's and Lindsay's actions. Northern supporters were pleased, while Southern backers felt uneasy. The debate was seen as damaging to the South's cause. Roebuck eventually withdrew the motion, not because of Southern victories, but to avoid defeat in a vote. The debate marked the end of discussions on mediation or recognition. News of Lee's setbacks at Gettysburg and Vicksburg's fall reached London, shifting perceptions on the war's outcome. The surrender of Vicksburg was seen as a significant blow to the South, altering views on the war's progress.|"[""1.

During July 1863, the fall of Vicksburg deeply affected Spence, causing him distress. Adams reported that the news led to panic among Cotton Loan bond holders. The upper classes were relieved they had not supported Roebuck's motion. The crisis of Southern efforts in England was seen as doomed from the start, worsened by Lee's setbacks in Pennsylvania. The real turning point had already passed, evident in Benjamin's recall of Mason from London. Mason, realizing British intervention was unlikely, withdrew on September 21. While Mason hoped for support from France, England remained neutral. The North was pleased by British inaction, with Lyons reporting a possible joint action by England, France, and Spain against the North. This idea was met with opposition, especially from Lyons, due to the ongoing denial by Seward that the war aimed to crush rebels, causing diplomatic tensions.|"[""1.

The British government faced a dilemma regarding their stance on the American Civil War. While some believed that a firm approach would be more effective than appeasement towards the Americans, others were wary of the potential consequences of such a declaration. The British Minister to the US, Lyons, expressed concerns about America's readiness for war, emphasizing the importance of maintaining cordial relations. Despite tensions, efforts were made to maintain neutrality, especially as the military situation in America shifted. The South, facing setbacks, sought to garner support in England, focusing on legal battles and lobbying efforts. However, the overall sentiment in England seemed to be shifting away from supporting the South, as evidenced by declining confidence in their success. The ongoing conflict and political maneuvering highlighted the complexities of international relations during this period.|"['1.

The _Index_ newspaper, controlled by Henry Hotze, used secret funds to influence writers in London during the Civil War. Hotze was connected to Southern agents in Europe but not fully trusted by Mason or Slidell. Materials from Hotze, including letters and cash books, were once in possession of Charles Francis Adams but have since been lost. Hotze provided news and editorials to London papers and distributed items like cigars and whiskey. Despite complaints about not having a paid writer at the _Times_, Hotze paid Percy Gregg, who later wrote about the Confederacy. Slidell believed strong influences would support their cause. Schwab's account of Erlanger's presence in Richmond is incorrect. Mason's role in Confederate finance is detailed in Walter M. Case's thesis. The change in British governmental intentions during the Civil War remains unclear.|"['1.

Schwab suggests that Erlanger & Company may have been suspiciously involved in holding the bonds in question and then selling them to Confederate agents when the market was collapsing. A newspaper report about Northern ships passing Vicksburg influenced the bond prices, with Lee's movements affecting their value. Bigelow published a list of alleged subscribers to the loan, including Gladstone, who denied the accusation as a forgery. Callahan's work on British policy towards America in 1863 has been misinterpreted, as the critical period was actually in 1862. Roebuck's egotism and encounter with Bright during a debate are recounted by Lamar. Disraeli favored strict neutrality throughout the Civil War, privately expressing doubts about the Union's restoration.|"[""1.

The Index magazine defended against criticisms of bias in reporting on the Civil War, dismissing them as originating from minority and opposing viewpoints. It highlighted French government support for the South, influencing opposition press like the Orleanist _Debats_ and Republican _Siècle_.

In 1863, tensions were high between the United States and Great Britain. The _Times_ reported on American prosperity despite the ongoing war, contrasting with previous reports of Northern struggles. Diplomatic agents like Slidell and Hotze played crucial roles for the South in Europe. Meanwhile, confidential communications revealed that the United States was better prepared for a potential conflict with Great Britain than in previous years. The _Liberator_ downplayed the impact of Beecher's tour of England and Scotland, suggesting that his influence on public opinion was exaggerated.

Northern friends in England were quick to organize public gatherings after the second emancipation proclamation in 1863. In contrast, Southern supporters, confident in the Confederacy's success, initially relied on newspapers for their views. By mid-1863, Spence recognized the need to counter Northern influence, forming a Southern Club in Manchester and others in neighboring towns. These clubs, mainly comprising energetic young men without much money, aimed to challenge Northern sympathizers. Despite financial challenges, Spence's efforts gained momentum, leading to public meetings and petitions for Southern independence. The initiative received praise for its vigor, with plans to expand to major cities like Liverpool and London. The goal was to convert passive support into active advocacy to influence government policy. The Index began reporting these events in November, highlighting the growing opposition to England's non-intervention in the American conflict.|"[""1.

"In the past, efforts were made to support the Southern cause in England, particularly in the manufacturing districts known as ""the North."" However, London, being a collection of cities with diverse interests, lacked the unity seen in the North. To address this, a committee was formed in London to spearhead activities supporting the South. Funds were secured from businesses involved in blockade-running, demonstrating a growing momentum behind the cause. Despite challenges and negative reports from correspondents like Gallenga, there was a strong belief in the South's resilience. The Manchester Southern Club emerged as a key player in organizing support, with plans to petition influential figures for intervention.

"After December 1862, there was no further mention of the Association. It is possible that its trivialities led to its demise, and in any case, it was not meant to attract public attention. The launch of the Southern Independence Association indicated a new strategy in London to coordinate and direct efforts already underway in the provinces. A detailed constitution and address highlighted the heroic struggles of the Confederates and England's ""general sympathy"" for their cause. It criticized the North for governmental tyranny, corruption, ruthlessness in war, and animosity towards Great Britain. The Association aimed to foster goodwill between Great Britain and the Confederate States, advocating for the gradual abolition of slavery while preserving property and civilization for the African American population. The Association, with its esteemed Committee and officers, had a substantial membership fee, but its effectiveness remained uncertain. The movement's strength was primarily in Manchester, where a peculiar situation emerged when pro-Northern speakers questioned the lack of Southern public meetings. The Association's appeal to the elite hindered its reach to the broader working-class and Radical England, already supportive of the Northern cause. Goldwin Smith's pamphlet criticized the Association for being aristocratic and aiming to incite war with the North, alienating potential supporters. The Association's lack of public meetings and the London branch's inactivity hinted at its faltering impact.

Mr. Adams' claims are bold, his arguments flawed, and his threats comical, yet he has managed to have an impact. We see his influence in the detention of the _Alexandra_ and the legal battles that followed, in the surprise attack on the rams at Birkenhead, and in the government's plan to amend the Foreign Enlistment Act to align with the United States' demands. Despite his questionable methods, Mr. Adams has achieved some success, especially in avoiding conflict between the two nations. The relationship between British Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Earl Russell, and the United States Secretary of State, Seward, has improved, with both sides showing less hostility. Seward remains confident in the North's victory and dismisses any suggestions of compromise with the South.

During the mid-1800s, a conflict arose between Britain and the United States concerning the recruitment of Irishmen for the Northern forces during the American Civil War. The British government was concerned about the enlistment practices that involved Irish laborers being coerced into joining the army upon arrival in America. The British Foreign Secretary, Russell, faced accusations that he did not adequately defend British law and honor in this matter. Additionally, tensions rose between Britain and Denmark over the Schleswig-Holstein territories. The British public was divided on whether to support Denmark against Prussia and Austria's ambitions. The British government faced criticism for its handling of the Danish crisis, with some accusing them of vacillating between strong action and weak diplomacy. Ultimately, the government's response to these challenges became a subject of intense parliamentary debate and scrutiny.|"[""1.

From February to June 1864, there was a significant focus on a particular issue. Initially, Southern supporters didn't see its relevance to the American situation, but they soon viewed it as a beacon of hope. Lindsay, who had established the Southern Independence Association in London, was excited by rumors of Napoleon's potential involvement. However, after realizing the truth, he turned his attention to news of an upcoming Southern victory. Despite uncertainties in political prospects, there was optimism about the Danish question. Lindsay, a key figure in the Southern cause, was disappointed by the London Independence Association's lack of action. He believed that Parliament should mediate and recognize the South, a sentiment echoed by the Manchester Association. Lindsay's plan involved a non-partisan parliamentary motion, aligning with the government's Danish policy. Despite challenges, he aimed to push for mediation to end the conflict between the United States and the Confederate States.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat issue was a significant focus from February to June 1864?\nA) The Danish question\nB) Southern independence\nC) Napoleon's involvement\nD) London Independence Association's actions\nE) The upcoming Southern victory"", ""Question 2:\nHow did Southern supporters initially view the issue in February 1864?\nA) As a beacon of hope\nB) With excitement about Napoleon's potential involvement\nC) With optimism about the Danish question\nD) With disappointment about lack of action by the London Independence Association\nE) They didn't see its relevance to the American situation"", 'Question 3:\nWho established the Southern Independence Association in London?\nA) Napoleon\nB) The London Independence Association\nC) The Manchester Association\nD) The Danish government\nE) Lindsay', 'Question 4:\nWhat was Lindsay excited about initially regarding Napoleon?\nA) His potential involvement in the conflict\nB) His support for the Danish question\nC) His plans for London Independence Association\nD) His upcoming visit to London\nE) His interest in the Southern victory', ""Question 5:\nWhat disappointed Lindsay about the London Independence Association?\nA) Lack of action\nB) Lack of support for the Danish question\nC) Lack of interest in the Southern victory\nD) Lack of communication with the Southern Independence Association\nE) Lack of alignment with the government's Danish policy"", ""Question 6:\nWhat did Lindsay believe Parliament should do regarding the Southern cause?\nA) Support the Danish question\nB) Recognize the South and mediate\nC) Align with the London Independence Association\nD) Push for Napoleon's involvement\nE) Echo the sentiments of the Manchester Association""]"|"['B) Southern independence', ""E) They didn't see its relevance to the American situation"", 'E) Lindsay', 'A) His potential involvement in the conflict', 'A) Lack of action', 'B) Recognize the South and mediate']"
"Lindsay suggested that Mason should return to England for a meeting with the Premier. Palmerston agreed, but no official invitation was extended. Lindsay pressed Mason to come, believing it would benefit the South. Meanwhile, a London group called ""The Society for Promoting the Cessation of Hostilities in America"" emerged, urging Parliament to take action for peace. Mason hesitated to go to London, feeling there was no support from Palmerston or Russell. Lindsay, however, was optimistic about influencing the government towards recognizing the Confederacy.

Palmerston's willingness to listen to suggestions for a change in British policy towards America, his satisfaction that Lindsay planned to delay the parliamentary motion, and his friendly attitude towards someone he had recently criticized for interfering in diplomacy, all point to a desire to prevent Southern allies from joining the growing criticism of the Government's Danish policy. Lindsay may not have fully understood this, appearing to have been misled in his correspondence with Mason. It is likely that the government was keen on not alienating supporters, hence the subtle use of the Danish situation without overt threats. The public press, previously pessimistic about the South, was now more optimistic, with the _Times_ leading the way. The Society for Promoting the Cessation of Hostilities in America proposed a deputation to Palmerston, representing a significant portion of the population, to push for action aligned with Lindsay's initial proposal. This initiative was slightly behind Lindsay's push for direct recognition, causing some disagreement among Southern supporters. Mason and Lindsay realized that the political gestures from Palmerston and Russell were more about securing votes than genuine support for the South.|"[""1.

"During a critical political crisis, Mr. Hunter, editor of the _Herald_, communicated with Hotze regarding Disraeli's involvement. Lindsay believed Disraeli's move could be advantageous and was willing to yield him the lead. Disraeli's potential accession was linked to success in Virginia.

A vote of censure ensued, with Derby criticizing the government's policy as one of ""meddle and muddle."" Lindsay's motion was postponed due to the parliamentary crisis.

In mid-1864, Mason's journey to London to seek recognition for the South left Confederate supporters in England feeling deceived by the government. Despite efforts to sway British neutrality, confidence in the South's ability to defend itself grew. The military situation in midsummer of 1864 was uncertain, with Sherman advancing towards Atlanta and Grant besieging Petersburg. Pro-Northern meetings in London overshadowed Southern support. British newspapers like _The Times_ influenced public opinion, despite the London _Daily Telegraph_ having a larger circulation. The South sought recognition, not mediation, believing it could defend itself. The ongoing war efforts in Virginia were closely watched, with hope that the South could endure. Southern supporters in England remained determined, but the events of mid-1864 dampened their spirits.|"[""1.

Lyons, a British official, reported to Russell in April 1864 about Captain Goodenough's confirmation of his American reports. Lyons expressed concern about the _New York Herald's_ tone predicting the end of the Civil War and potential retaliation against France and England. Efforts were made to boost immigration to fill labor shortages and army ranks during and after the war. There were accusations that foreign-born soldiers dominated Northern armies post-1862, but statistics were inconclusive. The British government's emigration data contradicted Southern claims of foreign enlistment. The Phinney case and debates in Parliament on emigration to America were also significant. Palmerston and Russell faced opposition from Granville, Clarendon, and the Queen's pro-German stance during this period.|"['1.

"After three years of intense efforts by the North to defeat the South and the South's defensive campaigns turning into offensive battles, the Civil War seemed to have reached a stalemate. To neutral observers in Europe, the war appeared to be at a standstill, much like how the Great War seemed to American neutrals in December 1916 after two years of conflict. The war had defied expectations of a swift resolution, and with each passing month, the scale of the conflict grew, and society seemed to normalize war. By mid-1864, many foreign observers, including those from Britain, believed that both sides were deeply entrenched in a conflict that showed no sign of a clear military victory. Despite this, there was a prevailing belief that the South would ultimately prevail due to its commitment to resistance until independence was secured. However, the North's association with emancipation and the South's defense of slavery had become a significant obstacle for Southern advocates. The issue of slavery had become a focal point, with even Southern supporters acknowledging the need for its gradual extinction. This shift in perception posed challenges for the South, as Northern allies capitalized on this vulnerability, labeling slavery as ""The Foul Blot."" The Index, in response, argued against this characterization, emphasizing that the South treated enslaved individuals as fellow human beings with respect and mutual obligations, refuting the notion of slavery as perceived in England."|"['1.

By treating slaves with unprecedented care and solving complex issues humanely, the South can proudly showcase their achievements. The defense of slavery by _The Index_ in response to Lincoln's emancipation edicts only highlighted the North's just cause. The public meetings organized by Spence faced obstacles due to the ""Foul Blot"" issue, hindering the Southern Independence Association's campaign. Despite the decline in Southern meetings by June 1864, Northern meetings continued, with prominent figures like George Thompson and John Bright actively supporting the Northern cause.

During the Civil War, British diplomats like Lyons aimed to avoid tensions with the North. Lyons noted that political sentiment in the North was shifting against Lincoln's re-election, with calls for an armistice. However, he emphasized that talks of peace always centered on reuniting the country. Lyons advised England and France to maintain a low profile to avoid interfering with the North's efforts. While the British government quietly hoped for a Northern victory, British newspapers, influenced by the *Times*, expressed confidence in the South and anticipated Lincoln's defeat. The *Times* initially reported fairly but later exaggerated Southern strength, misrepresenting military events.

In London, the _Army and Navy Gazette_ was a respected military journal with W.H. Russell as its editor. Despite his recall after the Battle of Bull Run, Russell staunchly supported the North during the American Civil War. The _Gazette_ often predicted Northern victories, even foreseeing the Confederacy's demise. However, their actual reports sometimes mirrored the _Times_ in highlighting Northern setbacks. Russell's bold predictions, like Sherman's Atlanta campaign, were not always accurate, leading to doubts about Northern success. The papers also discussed the upcoming Presidential election, with some speculating on Lincoln's potential defeat due to his perceived despotism.

During the Civil War, General Grant and Sherman were criticized for their slow and ineffective movements by some British newspapers. However, despite the initial doubts, Sherman's successful capture of Atlanta was praised for his strategic brilliance. The fall of Atlanta had a significant impact on the war and the political landscape. While some newspapers like the _Times_ initially downplayed the importance of Atlanta's capture, they later acknowledged its influence on Lincoln's re-election chances. The Democrats were seen as prioritizing peace over union, which was viewed unfavorably by some. Despite the war's toll on American commerce, the British press recognized the determination of the American people to reunite the nation. Ultimately, the British hoped for an end to the destructive war and a return to peace between the North and South.|"[""1.

Sherman's capture of Atlanta ensured Lincoln's re-election as President. The _Times_ was slow to recognize its military significance, suggesting Sherman was trapped. The _Gazette_ criticized this as biased, foreseeing election day chaos. Anti-slavery groups urged support for Lincoln. Lyons from Washington warned of Seward's foreign policy maneuvers for election purposes. Lincoln won re-election with a significant majority, surprising the press. The _Gazette_ commended America's peaceful elections but opposed reuniting. Despite initial tensions, Lincoln's conduct towards England improved over time. _Punch_ depicted Lincoln as a phoenix rising from the ashes of America's liberties. English supporters of the South faced opposition and failed to sway public opinion in manufacturing districts.

Due to the widespread distress in the cotton districts caused by the ongoing war in America, a meeting was held to urge Her Majesty's Government to intervene and stop the destruction of life and property in the country. By October 1864, the distress in Lancashire had eased, and public support was leaning towards the North. Even in Ireland, petitions circulated among working men to support Lincoln's administration and enlist in the Northern armies for emancipation. The Confederate Congress discussed arming slaves to replenish their armies, facing criticism for advocating freedom for slaves while previously deeming them incapable. Despite efforts by journals like _The Index_, British neutrality was maintained, with Lord Russell navigating diplomatic challenges. The _Times_ criticized Russell's stance, questioning his neutrality and predicting Southern success despite setbacks faced by Grant and Sherman.|"['1.

During the Civil War, General Sherman's expedition into Georgia was a significant event. His daring move was to escape to the coast where he could be rescued by the Northern navy. The _Times_ newspaper expressed doubts about Sherman's success and the South's prospects. However, Savannah fell without a fight on December 20, boosting the Federal cause. The _Times_ initially struggled to maintain confidence in the Southern cause after Savannah's fall, but eventually, hope was restored. The editor, Delane, and Southern sympathizers faced a blow to their confidence in the South.

When Lincoln was elected, significant changes were predicted: the South would likely give up the fight; the once unproductive lands worked by enslaved labor would thrive again with free labor; and the Confederates would need to rely on their own skills rather than the labor of others. Surprisingly, these ideas were penned by M. Henri Martin, a renowned French historian. A week later, _The Index_ criticized the support pouring from Germany to aid the North, suggesting that white-skinned Germans were being sold to fight in the South. Even the Confederate Secretary of State, Benjamin, accused France of deceit, claiming the French Emperor was taking advantage of the South's struggle to further his own agenda. This period also saw a change in British opinion of Lincoln, from initially portraying him as silly-faced to recognizing his abilities and power.|"['1.

During the Civil War, diplomatic tensions between the United States and England were high. Adams, a representative, received criticism for his replies to English deputations. However, the situation improved as Bright assured Sumner that relations were amicable. Despite rumors of European intervention, Bright emphasized that England was committed to neutrality. Meanwhile, military operations in the U.S. progressed. Sherman's advance from Savannah met little resistance, burning Columbia and evacuating Charleston. By March, Sherman faced opposition in North Carolina but continued his advance. Grant's strategic moves forced Lee to abandon Petersburg and Richmond, leading to the Confederate surrender in April 1865. The collapse of Southern resistance surprised foreign observers but was anticipated in British opinion. Despite last-ditch diplomatic efforts, the Confederacy fell, signaling the end of the war and the Confederacy.|"[""1.

The people in the North were praised for their gradual development in warfare and their ultimate skill. The Confederate agents in Europe were left with no hope, even privately. Mason tried to remain optimistic, but ultimately admitted defeat. The news of Lee's surrender coincided with Seward's injury in a runaway accident. Seward, a statesman once criticized, was now recognized for his moderate counsel. Seward's accident and Lincoln's assassination united England in sympathy and horror. Lincoln was shot by a Southerner in Ford's Theatre, while Seward was attacked in his home. These tragic events, fueled by revenge, did not reflect the true sentiments of the South. The crimes had a negative impact on the Confederacy and boosted sympathy for the North. Lincoln's character was reevaluated posthumously, showcasing a newfound admiration for the late President.|"[""1. What event coincided with the news of Lee's surrender?\nA. Seward's injury\nB.

"After Lee's surrender and Lincoln's assassination, Seward, incapacitated from duties, delayed American pressure on England. Lord Houghton questioned England's stance on Confederate States. Russell clarified that England had issued a neutrality proclamation after Lincoln declared war. England awaited official U.S. confirmation of war's end. Seward, weak but eager, held a Cabinet meeting. Bruce feared U.S. demanding withdrawal of belligerent rights. Russell, prompted by Bruce's concerns, changed policy, recognizing war's end and addressing Confederate cruisers. Derby criticized the abrupt shift in Parliament.

During the closing days of the war, diplomatic efforts by America were overtaken by the swift surrender of scattered Southern forces and the chaos in Washington following Lincoln's death and Seward's illness. Seward promptly acknowledged Russell's notification, ending British neutrality. Although he disagreed with some details, Seward recognized the restoration of normal relations between the United States and Great Britain. Russell presented this development to Parliament on July 4, expressing hope for lasting friendship between the two nations. Despite earlier predictions of British benefit from the Union's dissolution, the actual course of events debunked such prophecies. British policy shifted to support American power, leading to a stance of strict neutrality by the end of 1862.|"[""1.

The government's main focus was to maintain the state's prosperity and power during the prolonged war. As the British showed signs of recognizing the North's determination to conquer the South, there was a growing belief that the North might succeed in its goals. This led to a shift in Britain's attitude towards favoring a restored Union. Emancipation, supported by the public, influenced British politics, making it difficult to criticize the government's stance on America. Additionally, the question of democracy's future, intertwined with the American war, was a constant concern for the British. This issue was so significant that it required a separate chapter for detailed discussion.

On May 8, 1865, London received news of Johnston's surrender to Sherman. The same day saw a significant debate in the Commons on expanding the electoral franchise, the first in thirty-three years. This debate was not just a coincidence but a momentous event for Englishmen. The Civil War in America had a profound impact on British domestic policy. The example of American democracy had long influenced British politics, with travelers often reporting on American institutions. Before the Civil War, many praised American democracy, while others like Tremenheere criticized it. The Liberal movement in England was at a low point in 1860, with Palmerston and Derby opposing franchise expansion. The personal traits of Lincoln and Davis were closely observed in Britain, reflecting the political philosophies of the North and South. Overall, the American crisis highlighted the challenges of democratic institutions in national power, shaping political discourse in England.|"[""1.

"The initial denial of a connection between the American struggle and British institutions quickly faded. A month later, the _Saturday Review_ criticized the ""promiscuous democracy"" of the North, followed by other journals like the _Economist_. The _Economist_ believed England would now see the folly of imitating America, causing advocates of universal suffrage to feel a mix of alarm, gratitude, and shame. Soon, W.H. Russell suggested that America's failure during the war demonstrated the shortcomings of republican institutions, challenging America's attempt to establish new principles. English admirers of American institutions were now swayed towards the Monarchy. This shift in perspective highlighted the fighting spirit of British democracy. The _Quarterly_ published ""Democracy on its Trial,"" warning against following America's example. The _Atlantic Monthly_ discussed British views on America in terms of cotton supply.

In the coming changes in political philosophy due to American challenges, the importance of democracy will be reassessed. The true foundation of freedom will be seen in the balance of social classes rather than individual equality. The confusion between freedom and democracy will hopefully be cleared in the minds of the English people. Some critics, like Motley, believe that certain English newspapers' joy over American struggles stems from their disdain for democracy, not just America itself. Various views on the American situation have been expressed, with some attributing the conflict to slavery or the failure of the federal system. Despite differing opinions, the debate on democracy's role in America continues among English society, with some predicting the rise of an aristocracy in the United States.|"['1.

In the mid-1800s, the debate over democracy in America was fierce. Despite attempts to blame tariffs and democracy for the country's problems, events proved otherwise. The conflict boiled down to fundamental issues like right versus wrong, labor versus capital, and liberty versus absolutism. British citizens, like Bright, began to support American democracy over aristocracy. By 1862, labor and radical groups in Britain were rallying in support of the North during the American Civil War. The struggle for the Union was seen as a test for democracy worldwide. However, some in England feared the rise of democratic principles and predicted a descent into chaos. The debate over democracy in America influenced political attitudes in Britain, with some viewing America's challenges as a cautionary tale against democratic rule.|['1.

"The United States has often been held up as a model for other nations to follow. It's important to observe how the American system of government is functioning now, especially when faced with challenges. Some believe that if America had a parliamentary system like England, the Civil War might have been avoided. However, it's certain that different leaders would have been in power by now. In addition to conservatives criticizing the failure of democracy, supporters of the South praised the ""gentlemanly"" qualities of Southern leaders. They contrasted this with what they saw as the unruly behavior of Northern immigrants, who they believed were influencing American politics. On the other hand, Anthony Trollope painted a different picture of Americans during his travels, praising their independence, dignity, and knowledge. This positive view of American society was contrasted with the English class system, where social levels are distinct. The support for American democracy grew stronger in England when President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, showing a moral commitment to ending slavery. This led to public meetings in England where people expressed admiration for American political institutions and the fight against slavery."|"['1.

The descendants of commoners who were dissatisfied with limitations on voting rights, heavy taxes, and the disdain from landowners looked to America as a model of democracy. A meeting was called for seven o'clock, but by half-past five, the hall was already full, and by six, it was overcrowded. A second hall was also filled, and outdoor meetings were organized for two thousand people on Exeter Street.

During the American Civil War, England was confident in the North's victory, leading to political tensions. The _Quarterly_ in April 1865 believed England sympathized with the South. However, events unfolded differently. After Lincoln's assassination, sympathy for the North grew. By July, British elections showed overwhelming support for those who backed the North. This marked a turning point in British politics. The Reform Bill of 1867 shifted power to the working class, changing Britain from an aristocracy to a democracy. This transition was influenced by the American Civil War, showcasing the impact of democratic institutions. The bitter public attitudes during this time reflected a significant shift in British society towards democracy.

To American historians, the Civil War was primarily about preserving the nation, making British neutrality during the conflict seem unfriendly. The British Reform Bill of 1867 created a new nation, but Americans couldn't see past their war experience to appreciate the changing British attitude.
