Tavia, often misunderstood for being wild, was a loyal friend who loved her brother, Johnnie, and the outdoors. Despite being considered an idler by many, Dorothy saw the good in Tavia and defended her to her family.

As Memorial Day approached, the girls were busy getting ready for the festivities. Dorothy ensured their outfits were appropriate for the occasion, while Tavia took charge of the flowers and kept them fresh for the day.

At school, there was chaos. Some girls needed help with their scarves, others wanted to carry flags, and some insisted on wearing hats. Miss Ellis, usually strict, appeared even sterner than usual. She announced that those who missed rehearsal couldn't participate. This surprised many, especially when Sarah Ford, a newcomer, took the lead. Dorothy, who had worked hard behind the scenes, was excluded. The Dalton Drum and Fife Corps played a solemn tune in honor of fallen soldiers. Dorothy and Tavia, marching with veterans, looked striking with their flags. The next day, Dorothy's father, a war veteran, wanted Dorothy by his side. Despite his illness, he insisted on the Bugle being published. Dorothy assured him and left for the office, promising to return promptly.|"[""1.

Two days had passed, and Dorothy was feeling better. She followed Miss Ellis's advice to stay away from school, rest, and get fresh air. The mystery of Sarah Ford's accident remained unsolved.

"Tavia chuckled, ""She hasn't brought me jelly or roses yet, even if I were sick. My aunt prefers feeding two men over giving me enough. Well, what I call enough,"" she said, lounging lazily on the bench. ""I wonder what would happen if I fell ill. But no worries, I'm fine."" Tavia hurried home to share some news with her mother. She mentioned how lucky it was that her mother wanted her to go to Rochester, allowing her to escape the commotion. Tavia excitedly described the fabulous dress she'd wear to the picnic. Dorothy, not needing a wrap in the warm afternoon, passed by Aunt Libby and ventured through the orchard. She paused under a tree where Sarah had been found earlier.

Dorothy was eager to share some important news with her father. She informed him that Tavia had discovered a woman named Burlock living in Rochester.

The major expressed concern that Dorothy was dealing with matters too serious for her age, recalling the complications that followed her visit to the Bugle office. Despite regretting exposing her to danger, he praised her for producing a splendid paper. Major Dale shared the sad news that Burlock had passed away due to exhaustion.

"""Yes, I must admit I was proud to hear a dying man bless your name. He said you, a mere child, saved him from a death of shame.

Tavia, eager and confident, offered to help Dorothy with any worries she might have. As they prepared for the day, Tavia teased Joe playfully and left with a lunch box under her arm. The boys, including Jack, discussed Bugles and helping out. Soon, the girls gathered around Dorothy, expressing concern for her health. Tavia, on the other hand, fielded questions about various topics, including her new dress. Despite Dorothy looking a bit pale, she still radiated beauty with her blonde curls.

Soon the small area filled up quickly. Some people came to help, while others came to see what was happening. Alice and Tavia stood nearby with pale faces. Alice had pulled the squire away from Ralph, and eventually, two men managed to keep him away from Ralph, who was left quite injured. The squire was still angry and kept struggling, so they had to put handcuffs on him. The boys watching found it amusing as they had grudges against Squire Sanders. Franklin MacAllister, Alice's father and a town official, arrived and scolded the squire for his actions. He decided to remove the squire from his position due to his misconduct. Despite the excitement, Ralph decided to go to the drug store to treat his injuries. The squire left quietly after being advised to stay away from town until things calmed down.|['1.

Alice's father expressed his delight and pride in his daughter, referring to her as a tom-boy but loyal. He then turned to Tavia, asking about Anderson, whom he believed was Tavia's special friend. Tavia, laughing, clarified that the man was known to her but hinted that the trouble stirred by the old squire might have been to target Dorothy Dale, who was her true special friend. Alice, understanding her father's intentions to surprise Dalton school, led him to the classroom with excitement. Mr. MacAllister, a gentleman, assured the teacher of a compensatory holiday for the class, leaving a positive impression. Miss Ellis proceeded with the day's program, announcing a half-day session and granting the students the freedom to enjoy the day.

Dorothy cautioned Tavia not to mention her suspicions, as she needed to speak to her father first. She believed it unfair to blame the Fords for statements possibly influenced by the squire. Tavia jokingly praised Dorothy's lawyering skills and expressed her desire for her father to return to work. Tavia envisioned herself as the city clerk once her father took over the squire's position. Major Dale advised Tavia to focus on studies she may not find interesting, akin to practicing piano scales for more complex pieces. The news of Squire Sanders' downfall spread quickly in Dalton, with some calling for the sheriff's intervention. Mr. Ford regretted being misled by the squire and vowed to rectify his mistake.

Mr. Ford hesitated as he pondered the decision. Loyalty to one's political party was deeply ingrained, but the fate of the appointment hung in the balance. Major Dale, however, found a solution through his daughter Dorothy's perspective. Dorothy's influence, guided by her compassion for her friend, could sway the outcome positively. The major recognized the power of young voices in steering matters in the right direction, as seen in Dorothy's previous success in social causes. As the girls encountered a suspicious figure in the lane, they sprinted towards safety, outwitting the potential threat.

"""We need to go out tonight,"" he said, ""and inform local businesses to watch out for someone matching this description. If we had a regular police officer, we wouldn't have to do this."" To the veteran politicians of Dalton, who always voted on time but delayed paying taxes until the last notice, John Travers replacing Squire Sanders was a surprise. Poor folks aren't always popular, and the other candidate, Baldwin Blake, was charming during elections. Nonetheless, John Travers won without opposition in the council, surprising Mr. Travers as much as anyone. Mr. MacAllister whispered to Major Dale that Mrs. Travers was out visiting a sick friend and wouldn't be back until the next day. Mrs. Travers, lacking home-making skills, had attended a school focused on embroidery, neglecting practical disciplines. Consequently, Tavia, barely equipped for it, bore the burden early on. Despite the challenges, John Travers remained optimistic and understanding, especially when his wife was absent during family time. Tavia resolved to study hard to meet Dalton's expectations, realizing the importance of the opportunity her family had been given.

Dorothy hurried to the door, exclaiming, ""They're here! That's Ned's voice. I must go. Join me!"" Mrs. White, pleased with the bond between the girls, treated Tavia like a daughter.
