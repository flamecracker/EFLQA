Loftus was in the middle of a discussion with Catherine when Mabel's voice faded away in the background as she ran off. Suddenly, the sound ceased, and then the quick patter of feet returned. Trembling, Mabel threw herself into Loftus's arms. Loftus reassured her, attributing the noise to a rabbit scuttling home. He then suggested they all head home quickly. Mabel, feeling frightened, urged them to walk fast without speaking. Loftus, showing kindness, held Mabel's hand to comfort her. As they made their way back to Rosendale Manor, the inadequacies of the old house became apparent. Despite its spacious drawing-rooms, the dining-room, morning-room, and library were too small. Catherine and Mabel preferred having separate bedrooms due to their conflicting tastes. Mabel, feeling uneasy about her lonely room in the distant wing of the house, bid Catherine goodnight, pondering the strange sounds she had heard.|"['1.

She opened the windows of the close cab and breathed in the fresh sea air. It was a warm July evening, with a gentle breeze causing ripples in the harbor. The people of Northbury were mostly out on the water, as it was their preferred way to enjoy the pleasant weather. Each house had its own boat, ready to sail on the calm waves. From the water, one could see the quaint High Street. The Bells, in a white boat, noticed a cab heading towards Rosendale Manor. Matty, excited, pointed it out to Captain Bertram. Her sister, Sophy, teased her for being curious. Captain Bertram, amused, made a playful riddle comparing the cab to Noah's ark, much to Matty's delight.|"['1.
