"The group pondered the idea for a moment. ""Absolutely,"" affirmed Steve. ""It's true. We're always eager to return home in June, but just as eager to come back to school in September. I think we have more fun here than at home.""""Definitely,"" chimed in Perry enthusiastically. ""I certainly do. Summers are all the same for me. My family drags me to the Water Gap, and we stay there until it's time to return here. I play tennis, go for drives, lounge on the porch, and swim--""""Summers can be quite dull,"" Steve concurred. ""We head to the seaside, but it's filled with wealthy people who mostly change outfits, eat, and sleep. If you're planning any piracy, Perry, count me in! I'd love to join.""""Include me,"" added Joe. ""I've always thought I'd make a great pirate. I have a list of people I'd like to see walk the plank!""""I want to do something exciting!

"""I believe he will,"" responded Steve earnestly. ""Dad won't have much opportunity to use the boat this summer, especially since he'll be in the city more often. The issue is that the _Cockatoo_ is nearly too large for the three of us to manage.""""That's true. I'm familiar with the boat, Perry. She's quite sizable when it comes to docking or picking up a mooring. If we were all skilled sailors, it might be manageable, but I wouldn't want to handle the _Cockatoo_ without a couple of sailors onboard.""""He and Neil are knowledgeable about boats,"" Steve added. ""And they're both reliable. That would make five of us, which isn't too many. We can't afford to hire a cook, and someone will need to take care of that. Who can cook?""""Oscar is the type who will do anything as long as he thinks he doesn't have to,"" Joe replied. ""If we could convince him to join us and make it clear that he must not handle the cooking, then we're set!""""Why not bring them all if the boat can accommodate six?"" Joe suggested. ""The more people we have, the less each of us will have to do. I mean, a division of labor--""""It's not just a dream,"" Steve assured.

Perry made it to his room undetected, brimming with excitement for the adventures he had always yearned for. In his restless sleep, he dreamt of shipwrecks, pirate battles, and encounters with cannibals. His dreams were so bizarre that he found himself on a trolley-car instead of a motorboat, with pirates dropping nickels in the fare box! The next day, with no obligations until the crucial baseball game, Perry and his friends, including Fairleigh, Hanford, and Brazier, discussed their Adventure Club plans. Despite parental concerns, they were determined to make it work. They debated over camp cooking and the limited space on the _Cockatoo_, eventually deciding to include one more member for a total of seven lucky adventurers.|"['1.

In a room numbered 17, seven teenagers gathered to discuss forming a group. Steve Chapman, a tall and determined football captain, proposed electing a president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer. George Hanford, the senior class president, and Joe Ingersoll, the dry-humored first baseman, were among them. Perry Bush, the jolly and freckle-faced boy, Neil Fairleigh, the easy-going and lazy member, and Phil Street, the serious and honor student, completed the group. Oscar Brazier, known for his good-nature and hard work, was also present. Each had unique qualities, making them a diverse and interesting group. They planned to elect their leaders and embark on new adventures together.|['Question 1:\nWho proposed electing a president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer for the group?\nA) George Hanford\nB) Joe Ingersoll\nC) Perry Bush\nD) Steve Chapman\nE) Neil Fairleigh', 'Question 2:\nWhich member is described as a jolly and freckle-faced boy?\nA) George Hanford\nB) Perry Bush\nC) Phil Street\nD) Oscar Brazier\nE) Joe Ingersoll', 'Question 3:\nWho is the senior class president among the teenagers in the group?\nA) Neil Fairleigh\nB) Phil Street\nC) Oscar Brazier\nD) George Hanford\nE) Steve Chapman', 'Question 4:\nWhich member is described as easy-going and lazy?\nA) Joe Ingersoll\nB) Perry Bush\nC) Neil Fairleigh\nD) Phil Street\nE) Oscar Brazier', 'Question 5:\nWho is known for his good-nature and hard work in the group?\nA) Joe Ingersoll\nB) Oscar Brazier\nC) Phil Street\nD) Steve Chapman\nE) Perry Bush', 'Question 6:\nWhich member is described as a serious and honor student?\nA) George Hanford\nB) Joe Ingersoll\nC) Phil Street\nD) Steve Chapman\nE) Neil Fairleigh']|['D) Steve Chapman', 'B) Perry Bush', 'D) George Hanford', 'C) Neil Fairleigh', 'B) Oscar Brazier', 'C) Phil Street']
After the meeting concluded, Joe tallied the votes and declared Steve as the first choice, himself as the second, and Phil as the third. Phil suggested Perry should have been elected due to his early involvement, but Perry graciously declined. The group planned to reconvene at 8 p.m. for further discussions. Steve and Joe were flooded with applications to join the Adventure Club, with Wink Wheeler persistently seeking entry. Despite everyone's fondness for Wink, they hesitated due to the limited space. The group considered adding Wink and Harry Corwin, but the idea of a coin toss was proposed to decide. Perry humorously pointed out the irony of starting with thirteen members in the Adventure Club, emphasizing the excitement and unpredictability of their upcoming journey.|"['1.

When the club meeting ended that evening, the Adventure Club had welcomed six new members and acquired the cabin-cruiser, _Follow Me_. Joe and Steve celebrated with ginger-ale, toasting to success. Sixteen days later, on July 8th, Perry Bush, a young boy in casual attire, sat on the motor-boat's deck at Ballinger's Yacht Basin, eagerly awaiting his crew. The bustling marina filled his senses with the scent of the sea, sawdust, and boat maintenance sounds. Perry relaxed, soaking in the warm sunlight, whistling a tune. Graduation had brought them home, leading to plans for a summer adventure on the _Adventurer_ (formerly _Cockatoo_). The crew had made last-minute additions to their provisions and personal belongings, eagerly anticipating their departure from Bay Shore. Despite delays, excitement and preparations were in full swing, with each member bringing unique contributions to their upcoming voyage.|"['1.

Perry, standing near the smoke-stack, grumbled about Neil buying yet another necktie. He jokingly considered leaving without them by starting the engine, but since he knew nothing about it, it was just talk. Soon, the latecomers arrived looking hot and annoyed, carrying parcels instead of bags. Perry, not a mechanic, easily operated the electric horn, startling his friends. They scrambled aboard, exhausted from the heat. Perry was surprised by their flushed faces and asked if they ran all the way. After sharing their ordeal of waiting and walking in the heat, they eagerly sought ice water. Planning to sail to Bay Shore, they hurriedly changed into sea clothes to catch a breeze and escape the sweltering heat.|"['1.

After a brief week on the boat last summer and some engine instruction, the crew set sail with little knowledge of the journey ahead. Despite this, they had common sense and hoped to avoid danger. Mr. Chapman trusted the crew, and the boys, led by Steve, embarked on their adventure. Each member had a role, with Han proudly serving as crew. As they navigated through busy waters, Perry learned about sailing rights and whistle codes. Joe, the chief engineer, shared his knowledge from a boating book, much to Perry's annoyance. Perry tested Joe's engine knowledge, causing Joe to consult his book. The crew faced challenges and learned valuable lessons as they set sail on the _Adventurer_.|"[""1.

Today, Joe marveled at the engine's smooth operation on the _Adventurer_ as it sailed through the water flawlessly. His fascination with the intricate machinery was evident as he pondered its workings with a mix of admiration and curiosity. Meanwhile, Steve had his meal on the bridge, with Neil assisting him between his duties of steering and keeping watch. Below deck, the rest of the crew enjoyed a meal of canned beans, bacon, potato chips, and more, served on a beautifully set table with silverware matching the elegant design. Despite Ossie's apologies for the simple menu, the group eagerly ate their dessert of bananas and pears, occasionally pausing to investigate any sounds from the ship. Steve navigated towards Rockaway Point while discussing their route, preferring the open sea over island passages for the journey to Fire Island.|"[""1.

"Phil and Han, who had never seen Coney Island, listened to Joe's tales of the resort as the ship rocked in the waves. Ossie was upset he missed seeing it. The ship plunged through the swells, splashing water on the deck. Joe searched for seasick medicine but the ship steadied before he found it. Han and Ossie relaxed on the cabin roof, while the others sat comfortably on the bridge deck. The breeze cooled them as they sailed past beaches and saw pleasure boats. Three porpoises swam alongside, sparking a debate among the boys. They named them ""porphins"" but the creatures left soon after. Ossie fell asleep below deck, and a porpoise even boarded briefly. Steve taught Phil, Joe, and Perry how to steer the ship. They anchored near Bay Shore, greeted by boys on another boat."|"['1.

"The _Follow Me's_ tender quietly moved alongside the boat, and the group of young sailors climbed aboard amidst cheerful greetings. The visitors were a fine-looking bunch, already sporting sunburns from a week at sea. Wink Wheeler was the eldest at eighteen, followed by Harry Corwin, Bert Alley, and Caspar Temple at seventeen, and George Browne, also known as ""Brownie,"" and Tom Corwin at sixteen.

"The Adventure Club had a bustling day exploring the town before gathering for dinner at the hotel. Thirteen hungry boys devoured their meals, then returned to the boats for a cozy evening on the _Adventurer_. Perry played music, and everyone chatted and sang, enjoying the night. The Follow Me crew bid goodnight and set off into the starlit darkness, leaving the _Adventurer_ peaceful. The next morning, the two boats set sail, the sun rising over Fire Island. The crew busied themselves with chores, joking and teasing each other. Joe, gaining confidence with the engine, affectionately called it ""She.""

"Steve calmly responded, ""She's only doing about seventeen. The throttle isn't nearly open yet. But I guess that's enough,"" glancing across the water. Perry, leaning across the gunwale, beckoned insultingly. The _Follow Me_ replied to the taunt, but what the reply was they didn't know on the _Adventurer_, for the latter was ahead now by its full length and gaining perceptibly every moment. Tom Corwin's head appeared over the cabin roof, took a look at the rival craft, and popped from sight again. The _Follow Me_ stopped going back and hung with her nose abreast the _Adventurer's_ stern. Phil, who had been writing a letter in the cabin, emerged and joined the group outside. ""About seventeen, I think. Still, Harry said the _Follow Me's_ best was eighteen, and she isn't losing any, so we may be doing eighteen, too. Guess we might as well settle the matter right now, though."" With which he pulled the throttle to the limit, and the white cruiser, quivering from stem to stern, forged ahead. ""We're doing a good twenty miles an hour now,"" shouted Steve above the hum of the motor, ""and she won't go any faster unless we get out and push!""

Two boats, the _Adventurer_ and the _Follow Me_, set off on a cruise to Shelter Island. However, the _Follow Me_ encounters engine trouble, causing a delay. The crew of the _Adventurer_ offers to tow them while the _Follow Me_ fixes the engine. Despite the setback, they reach North Sea Harbour for a late lunch. The crew of the _Follow Me_ enjoys a cold meal while the _Adventurer_ indulges in a delicious dinner. After some swimming and engine repairs, they finally head to Shelter Island, arriving late. The crew enjoys dinner ashore and joins a dance. The next day, some members explore the hotel while others seek adventure with new acquaintances.

Steve and Joe found themselves in a challenging situation as a thick fog rolled in around their boat. Steve, the captain, quickly took charge, instructing Joe to prepare the fog-horn to prevent any accidents. He decided to slow down the boat to navigate through the fog safely. The eerie silence of the mist enveloped them as they heard distant sounds of other ships. Steve remained calm, using the compass to guide them towards Vineyard Haven. The fog settled on their sweaters, and the boat's progress was only evident by the gentle throb of the engine. Despite the uncertainty, they continued towards their destination, with the fog-horn sounding periodically to alert other vessels.|"['1.

Silence enveloped the bridge deck, broken only by the soft hum of the engine and the steady drip of water from the awning. Steve gazed ahead, alert and attentive. Suddenly, Perry followed his lead. The distant steamer's warnings echoed intermittently, while the _Follow Me_ emitted mournful sounds. Steve, puzzled, noticed the sounds coming from unexpected directions. As he consulted the compass and charts, uncertainty loomed. The foghorn's distant calls added to the confusion. Steve, contemplating the situation, decided to change course.

Adjusting the boat, he continued, ""Keep your ears open, Phil. If you hear the surf, shout."" Steve then crawled to Phil's side to listen for the sound of waves breaking.

Steve quickly shifted the boat into reverse, causing a powerful churn of water as the _Adventurer_ began to move backward. Perry, holding a boat-hook, struggled along the wet deck to the bow, just in time to see a stone jetty disappearing into the mist. Phil, gripping the flag-pole, was sprawled on the deck, using his legs to keep the boat away. Steve consulted the chart, realizing they were cornered by a breakwater. Determined to find a way out, he instructed the crew to stay alert. The boat navigated cautiously, with Steve at the helm, Neil and Phil watching the starboard side, and Perry sounding the fog-horn.

Slowly, Steve turned the ship's wheel to the right. The gear creaked beneath the deck, audible in the quiet. Despite no warning from the lookouts, Steve adjusted the wheel once more, now steering the _Adventurer_ due east. Peering into the fog, he relied on the compass for direction. Perry sounded the fog-horn intermittently. Suddenly, Neil's voice reached Steve from the bow, reporting waves hitting the jetty's end. Confident they were safe, Steve guided the ship carefully, instructing the crew. As they entered the harbor, Steve directed Han to secure the ship. After a successful docking, they relaxed, relieved. Amidst the fog, they stayed onboard, passing time with games and discussions, until the mist cleared, and they could finally head ashore.|"[""1.

Supper went well despite the mid-afternoon luncheon. The evening on the yacht was cozy, with the fog wrapping around them. In the morning, the fog persisted, but there was hope it would clear. Steve and Han paddled ashore for supplies, disappearing into the mist. As they wandered, the fog began to thin, revealing a mysterious landscape. They encountered an old-fashioned horse-drawn chaise, sparking their curiosity. After purchasing milk and eggs, they tried to find their way back but soon realized they were lost in the fog.|"['1.

"Perry carefully placed the worn milk can, for which they had paid a deposit, on the ground. He paused, taking in the thick fog around them, and dramatically exclaimed, ""Lost on Martha's Vineyard, or The Mystery of the Four Dozen Eggs!""

"""He muttered resentfully about leaving him there,"" Perry thought. ""I won't yell anymore. He's so focused on poison-ivy, maybe I got into it too!"" The idea worried him. He recalled brushing leaves, unsure if he was susceptible. An itching sensation on his back made him squirm. His left wrist felt prickly, inflamed, like his right. Panicked, he jumped out of the dingey, pushed it into the water, and rowed into the mist. He realized he treated Han poorly and didn't know where the _Adventurer_ was. Still, he rowed, hoping to find the cruiser. As he rowed, he scratched and wiggled to abate the itch.

Perry heard a call to hurry, but rowed in circles due to favoring his right side. Frustrated, he tried to locate the voice, rowing in a new direction. Confusion arose as Perry mistook another boat for his own. Startled, he almost capsized the dingey. A boy from the black boat approached with a boat-hook, explaining that he and Han had gone ashore. Perry, in need of alcohol, was relieved when Cas offered to help. Despite the lack of alcohol, Cas suggested peroxide as an alternative.

Perry felt disoriented as he rowed in various directions, feeling tired and hungry. Cas offered him cookies and water, lifting his spirits. Perry rowed the dingey, realizing it was not meant for rowing due to its size and oars. The fog made it hard to see, and Perry struggled to find the shore.

Far away from the men, Perry once more put down his oars and grabbed the can of milk. Despite the warmth, it tasted delightful. After sealing the can, he resumed rowing. Suddenly, the fog vanished, revealing a vast harbor. Perry noticed numerous boats anchored in the calm blue water. Across the beach, a group of figures looked despondent. Perry felt like a marooned sailor. Exhausted and blistered, he rowed to shore, greeted by a silent, displeased group. Five angry youths boarded the boat. Perry's friend Harry took an oar, leaving Perry to row alone. As they approached the _Follow Me_, a storm of complaints erupted, blaming Perry for their long wait.

The following day began clear and hot. After breakfast, the _Adventurer_ set sail with the _Follow Me_ bidding farewell. The boat cruised across the bay at a good speed towards the mainland. The journey was smooth, with sights of Manomet Hill and Plymouth Beach. Once in town, they explored and visited Plymouth Rock. Neil departed by train, leaving the group feeling a sense of loss.

The boat is missing from the harbor, which suggests it might have been taken as a prank or stolen. The group decides to investigate. Steve suggests that the control might have been locked, leading the culprits to take the other boat, Follow Me. The Adventurer heads towards the harbor mouth, asking for information along the way. They learn a dark boat passed by around nine. The team debates whether the boat went north or south, with Phil suggesting they head north towards Portland. Steve agrees, acknowledging that Phil's plan is as good as any. They brace themselves for the journey, ready to search for their missing boat.|"['1.

The group on the boat discussed their strategy. While most agreed on heading north, Bert Alley disagreed, proposing a different plan. Phil, contemplating their options, suggested that the missing boat might need to refuel soon. Steve, steering the boat towards Gurnet Point, emphasized the need to take a chance and trust their instincts. The friends split up on the boat, some keeping watch while others rested. The boat sped on, leaving a foamy trail in the moonlit water. Ossie made hot coffee and sandwiches in the galley. A passing coasting schooner briefly diverted their attention, but they soon resumed their course. As they neared Baker's Island, they spotted a dark shape ahead without any lights, leading to a tense moment of uncertainty until Steve confirmed it was likely a boat traveling in the same direction.|"['1.

"The boat ahead was about a mile away, and the _Adventurer's_ small searchlight wasn't strong enough to reach that far with its bright light. ""They're heading for the harbor,"" Harry Corwin said, ""so she can't escape us if we lose her now.""

As the _Adventurer_ approached the white beacon, Han dropped the anchor into the water with a soft splash. Steve and Bert Alley stayed on deck, watching the dark silhouette of a boat nearby.

Steve, looking tired, speculated about the whereabouts of the missing boat, the _Follow Me_. The group decided to search the inner harbor at Gloucester. Bert Alley, feeling in need of coffee, joined the search. The _Adventurer_ set off at dawn, scanning the piers and coves. Despite the daylight, the search for the _Follow Me_ in the vast inner harbor proved challenging. Disappointed, they admitted defeat by 7 a.m. However, a sudden sighting of a drab-colored powerboat in the distance sparked excitement. Steve noticed a possible escape route on the chart leading to Ipswich Bay. With determination, they headed towards the Squam River, suspecting it as the path the _Follow Me_ might have taken.

The _Adventurer_ swiftly approached the bridge at the cove, navigating carefully through the narrow outlet. The boat successfully passed under the bridge, entering a serene canal leading to the river. As they cruised down the Squam River, surrounded by picturesque summer camps and cottages, the crew enjoyed breakfast on deck. Steve noted that the _Follow Me_ could not have navigated this path in the dark. They stopped at a gas station where a man mentioned seeing a black boat without a name, possibly the missing _Follow Me_. The crew pondered the boat's possible routes, considering areas like the Essex River or Newburyport.

A short while later, the two boats continued their journey along the shore. The _Follow Me_ had lost an anchor but gained a dingey, suspected of being stolen. They had dinner at half-past two, anchored at Joppa Flats, and discussed the day's adventure. The _Follow Me_ showed signs of damage, but it was repairable. The stolen dingey was in poor condition. They decided to leave it in Newburyport. Repairs kept them in town for two days. Once ready, they set out early in the morning. Passing various landmarks, they encountered rough seas near Cape Porpoise. Some crew members, including Joe, suffered from seasickness. However, the sun eventually broke through, and the crew enjoyed calmer waters as they reached Portland Harbour. The Adventure Club spent a week exploring without any major adventures, enjoying their time in Portland and Casco Bay.|['1.

Steve and his friends enjoyed their time exploring the Maine Coast, but eventually, they grew tired of stopping at every rock formation. Perry's hope of finding an affordable island seemed slim since he only had nine dollars in his pocket recently. Moving on from Casco Bay, they spent pleasant days in Camden, where they relished home-cooked meals and social gatherings. Ossie, the cook, was delighted to have a break from cooking and enjoyed the delicious food ashore. The crew, dressed in casual attire, embraced the outdoor lifestyle, swimming, eating hearty breakfasts of eggs and bacon, and mingling with friends. They made new acquaintances, played tennis, and went on road trips with a local named Globbins. The boys promised to return to Camden on their journey back, cherishing the memories of their time in the picturesque bay.|"['1.

The group enjoyed dinner on the decks of their boats, close enough to pass dishes easily. They relaxed in the sun, chatting and fishing for supper. They decided to spend the night at Mystery Island's Titania's Mirror. As twilight fell, the pool shimmered with hues like a pearl-shell. Mosquitoes made sleep uneasy, but morning brought a refreshing swim. Some swam to the entrance, enjoying the radiant sunlight. Tragedy loomed as two swimmers ventured too far.

As they left Mystery Island for Bar Harbor, they marveled at the volcanic origin of the island. Later, they explored Frenchman's Bay, enjoying a lavish dinner ashore.

Most of the group found the idea exciting, but Steve, Phil, and Bert Alley refused to approve of it. Steve warned that they could end up spending the night in jail for pretending to be gentlemen. The rest, led by Perry and Wink Wheeler, continued up the path towards a brightly lit area. As they approached a grand residence, they caught the attention of some servants. Inside, a large lawn was set up for a gathering with music and dancing. Perry and Wink confidently approached the terrace, where they were welcomed by the hostess. The other boys hesitated but eventually followed. Perry decided to explore a nearby tent, only to be told that supper was at ten. With an hour to spare, they found themselves unsure of what to do next, feeling out of place among the dancing guests. Cas Temple even remarked that he would prefer to be in bed, finding the event dull.|['1.

As the dancing started in full swing, Perry, Wink, and Ossie got separated from their friends in the growing crowd. They found themselves by a walled space overlooking the water, lit up by hundreds of lights. Perry admired the view and joked about it being like an island. Just as they were about to discuss further, they were interrupted by footsteps. They moved to a stone-floored verandah, perched on the parapet, and observed the colorful scene. Alone on the porch, they peered into a dimly-lit library. Suddenly, a man in evening attire entered through a window, revealing his criminal intent to crack a safe. Perry, sensing trouble, watched anxiously as the man deftly opened the safe. The suspenseful scene left Perry's heart racing at the thought of witnessing a robbery.|['1.

The barometer on the boat, the _Adventurer_, was a source of amusement because no one could interpret it correctly. Steve had given up on trying to understand it, but Joe still believed in its weather predictions, even though no one else did. As they sailed past the Seal Islands, a sudden storm hit them unexpectedly. The sky darkened, the wind howled, and the sea grew rough.

"""There's too much land around here,"" he shouted to Joe, ""to leave me happy. And, what's more, I'm none too certain just where we are at this blessed minute. So it's the wide ocean for yours truly. We'll just have to run for it and trust to luck!""

The words were scarcely off his lips when a cry of mingled astonishment and alarm sprang from Steve as he threw his weight on the wheel. At the same moment there was a shock that sent all hands reeling, the _Adventurer_ quivered from stern to stern, and then, after a moment no longer than a heart-beat, lurched forward again. Directly over the bow, glimpsed vaguely through the rain and gloom, rose a towering cliff.

Steve's frantic efforts were in vain, for although he tore at the clutch and the propeller thrashed the water astern, the _Adventurer_ was already in the smother of the surf and an instant later she struck. Afterwards the boys looked back on the ensuing five minutes as a dream rather than a reality. The cruiser grounded with an impetus that set pans rattling in galley, lifted again and once more thumped her stern down, as she did so swinging her stern slowly around in a last frantic effort to pull clear.

Then the boat careened, a sea washed clean across the deck and, with her keel forward of the engine firmly imbedded in the"|"['1.

The boys faced a perilous journey from the ship to the shore, battling the waves and the elements. Han slipped but managed to hold on, while Phil hesitated before taking the plunge. With the others already ashore, Phil struggled in the churning water, clinging desperately to a rope. Eventually, with the help of his friends, he reached the safety of the beach. The boys huddled together, watching their boat weather the storm. Steve regretted not securing the stern anchor, but remained hopeful that the boat could withstand the battering.

Perry took on the task while the others followed Steve to the edge of the breakers. They watched as Steve returned to the _Adventurer_, not attempting to swim but pulling himself along the line. His head was mostly underwater. After a while, he emerged, climbed back on deck, and disappeared briefly. Eventually, he reappeared and started the return trip. Perry and the others formed a line, helping Steve back to the beach. Steve reported that he had managed to secure something and found a tin cup. They tried to climb up the cliff but struggled in the darkness. Finally, they reached a small ledge where they huddled together for warmth. Steve attempted to start a fire but failed. They spent a miserable night, soaked and shivering, waiting for morning. Ossie fell ill but improved later. As dawn broke, they saw the _Adventurer_ still struggling in the waves, looking forlorn.|['1.

Joe expressed his doubts about rescuing the stranded person, comparing it to a challenging task. After having breakfast, the group headed to the beach, feeling sore and stiff. Despite the heavy mist, limiting their visibility, they estimated being two miles from the mainland. They split into two groups to explore the island, agreeing to regroup within an hour. Surprisingly, they discovered the island was small, mostly rocky, with limited vegetation. Disappointed by the lack of progress, they decided to return, gathering firewood on the way. However, starting a fire proved difficult due to the dampness. Joe humorously compared their situation to Robinson Crusoe, suggesting that without a shipwreck, the fictional character would have struggled to survive.|"['1.

The tide had receded, making Steve's journey back to the _Adventurer_ easier. He returned with a jug of gasoline, ready to start a fire. Joe joined him, and together they gathered supplies and food. After a satisfying breakfast of bacon and coffee, they waited for the tide to go down. The boys then inspected the _Adventurer_, finding it mostly intact, although flooded in some areas. Steve suggested plugging the leaks and using a pump to try to get the ship off the beach. However, the sand had buried the bow and propeller. Steve noticed a rock in the distance that could help them if they could attach a line to it. Their hope for rescue started to bloom.|['1.

It was challenging work. Initially, the bow line was swapped for a smaller rope and taken through the rough waves to the ledge. Steve, with Joe and Han's help, managed to secure a large cable around the rock, protecting it with a blanket. They returned to the _Adventurer_ in triumph. Meanwhile, Phil directed the others to seal the seams with muslin strips. The cable was led to the windlass, and they pumped out the water. They waited to see if the caulking held. By noon, they ate cold rations and glimpsed sunlight. The wind calmed, and the mist cleared, revealing the mainland. They cheered and climbed the cliff to assess their location. Despite uncertainties, they awaited high tide optimistically. At sunset, they attempted to free the _Adventurer_ with the engine, windlass, and teamwork. Finally, with a shout, the boat budged, lifting spirits as they awaited high tide.|"['1.

After that, it was only a matter of time. The cruiser slowly moved off the sand, floating more freely minute by minute until the stern found deep water. Within about thirty minutes, they had the boat riding clear and began pulling up the cable. Unable to free the rope from the rock, they had to cut it. They cautiously turned towards a lighthouse beacon on the shore. They had to keep the pump running as a leak emerged, but it wasn't a major issue. They were relieved to escape with only a few damages. Later, they anchored in a narrow harbor for the night but had to move ten miles down the coast for repairs. The hull needed more work than expected, requiring a week's stay. Most of the crew left by rail, leaving Steve and Phil to oversee repairs. The _Adventurer_ was eventually ready, shining with new paint, and set sail for Penobscot Bay.|"[""1.

After two delays, a storm caused another setback, pushing their departure to late August for Squirrel Island. Han wanted to visit friends there, but since they had a week, they weren't in a rush. They stopped at Portland for supplies before aiming for Provincetown, planning to cover 125 miles by evening. While on the way, an object was spotted far off, revealed to be a wrecked schooner named Catspaw from Norfolk. The crew of the Adventurer and Follow Me observed the damaged vessel with its cargo of pine boards, masts broken, and deserted decks. Despite the crew's absence, they contemplated salvaging the lumber but decided it was too risky. The crews exchanged signals, acknowledging the sad fate of the abandoned ship.|"['1.

The two boats cautiously approached the _Catspaw_, an abandoned vessel. Steve, Joe, and Han boarded the old ship, which was deserted with empty quarters and davits. Despite the water inside, the boys were confident the ship wouldn't sink due to the lumber. They worked hard to rig a jury-mast and set sail, preparing to tow the schooner to Portsmouth. After setting up a crew and supplies, they began the slow journey with the cruisers nearby. Despite the challenging weather and rough seas, the boys managed to set off, waving triumphantly as the _Catspaw_ slowly followed. Perry, feeling important, sat on the windlass, exchanging waves with the crew on the cruisers. The journey was slow but determined, with the boys ready for whatever challenges lay ahead.|"['1.

Joe found steering the _Catspaw_ quite demanding compared to the _Adventurer_. His arms were exhausted when he handed over the wheel to Wink. Joe likened steering the _Catspaw_ with the high sea to handling a heavy scow. The _Adventurer_ and _Follow Me_ were sailing towards Boon Island with Kittery Point about thirty miles away. The crew estimated reaching Portsmouth Harbour by 2 a.m. Despite the potential risks due to bad weather or equipment failure, the crew remained optimistic and enjoyed the thrill of the adventure. Perry was thrilled with the excitement, while Wink preferred above-water adventures. Later, a tugboat approached the _Adventurer_, offering assistance, but the boys on the _Catspaw_ wondered if they should have accepted it. As darkness fell, the crew prepared lanterns to signal their position to the other boats. A squall hit around eight, making steering the _Catspaw_ challenging. By the end of the evening, the crew faced dark, stormy conditions, bracing themselves against the chilly wind.|['1.

The ocean surged with the force of the nor'wester wind, causing the waves to crash heavily against the ship's rail and lumber, sending sprays of water across the deck. The _Catspaw_ swayed and struggled, indicating the cruisers were facing challenges. Bert navigated through the darkness and spray to join the others, discussing their predicament. Perry expressed uncertainty about their situation, acknowledging the difficulty of leaving the ship. Despite the rough conditions, they found solace in the fact that they were safer on the ship than on the boats. As they awaited signals from the _Adventurer_, they worked together to release the cables. Eventually, they received the signal to cast off, signaling a plan for the next steps.

Perry, who initially claimed not to be tired, eventually succumbed to sleep in the captain's cabin on the rolling ship. Joe, skilled at waking up at set times, roused everyone at two in the morning. They struggled to maintain their balance due to the increasing gale as they headed to the galley. Bert lit a fire while the rest went to the wheel. Wink, though weary, informed them of a ship, likely the _Adventurer_, in the distance. Perry, bundled in his slicker, kept watch, feeling the wind and spray relentlessly battering him. Despite his efforts, sleep threatened to overtake him. Perry, feeling lonely and anxious, tried to push away thoughts of the dangers they faced. The morning brought little relief as they found themselves still adrift at sea, with only the sight of a distant brig offering a glimpse of hope before it disappeared from view.|['1.

The boys had breakfast around 6:30 in the morning. There wasn't much left besides coffee and bread, and the situation didn't look good if the storm persisted. Perry mentioned he'd prefer drowning over starving. A positive turn occurred when the _Adventurer_ approached by 9:00, followed by the _Follow Me_ at noon, reuniting the schooner and the two convoys. Despite their low spirits, they had to wait as there was no chance of getting supplies. Dinner aboard the _Catspaw_ was meager with little left from breakfast. The cruisers brought some comfort, and as the wind calmed down around 5:00, they set sail towards the coast. They managed to get supplies from the cruisers just before darkness fell, bringing relief and hope to the exhausted crew.|"['1.

The small boat narrowly avoided tipping over multiple times as it pulled away, and ten minutes later, the _Catspaw_ was once again trailing behind the cruisers. A hearty supper of bacon, potatoes, and plenty of bread lifted the crew's spirits, especially as the stars emerged and the sea calmed. The second night was peaceful as the weather cleared and the sea became almost normal. By early dawn, with sunlight glinting on the water, the Isles of Shoals beckoned from six miles away. The _Catspaw_ slowed as it neared the shore, passing Portsmouth Light by morning. The tired but proud crew went ashore at noon, seeking a well-deserved meal. They recounted their adventures to a reporter and later met with attorney Mr. Hyatt, who explained their legal claim regarding the salvaged ship and cargo.|"[""1.
