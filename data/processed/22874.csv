The events that followed were a nightmare for Merriwell. He carried Inza in his arms, dodging pebbles and stones as the mountain side crumbled around them.

"Del Norte appeared fearful. He had used up many matches to barely see the huge pile of earth and rocks blocking the cave's entrance. A massive boulder obstructed most of the way out. The noise of the landslide assured him the boulder was wedged in by earth and timber, impossible to clear even in a week. In the dim light, the two men stared at each other's terrified faces, eyes wide with horror, mouths dry, and lips pulled back in fear. They resembled wild animals. Despite Ridgeway's belief that there was no hope, he stood up. Led by the Mexican, they moved through the cave, bending to avoid hitting their heads on the rocky ceiling. They explored all three chambers connected by a single passage. When they reached the third chamber's dead-end, panic set in. ""We're trapped!"" Ridgeway exclaimed, feeling the mountain closing in. ""It's over! I crave one last breath of fresh air, one last glimpse of the outside world!"" ""Wait!"" Ridgeway demanded, reaching out to the Mexican. ""Don't abandon me! You caused this!

Ridgeway, filled with rage, lunged at Del Norte, grabbing his throat. The Mexican, in a desperate attempt to defend himself, managed to draw a shining object from his bosom and struck Ridgeway with it. Ridgeway, initially standing tall, suddenly collapsed to the ground after the second blow. Del Norte, now standing over Ridgeway's body, noticed a peaceful expression on Ridgeway's face as if he found solace in his demise. As the torchlight dimmed, Del Norte stepped over Ridgeway's body, contemplating his next move. Despite the smoke filling the chamber, Del Norte saw a glimmer of hope as he ventured into a narrow passage, spurred by the possibility of escape.

He felt weak and dizzy, on the brink of falling. Despite the struggle, he managed to navigate through a narrow cleft in the mountain. Resting on ledges along the way, he battled intense fear of slipping back. Finally, reaching the top, he collapsed, only to revive and discover the breathtaking beauty around him. Overwhelmed by the fresh air and stunning scenery, he realized he was free from the ordeal. Vowing revenge on Frank Merriwell, he felt alive and determined to make Merriwell suffer.

Jerome explained his plan to Merriwell, emphasizing the strategy of organizing a stock company to fund the construction of the railroad without risking their own money. By capitalizing the Central Sonora Railroad Company for ten million dollars, they aimed to raise funds by selling stock to the public. This way, they could build the railroad using the public's money while retaining control and potential profits. Jerome assured Merriwell that with their established credit and connections, they could secure the necessary funds without personal investment. Even if the railroad didn't yield profits, they had a plan to mitigate losses and maintain control of the venture. This method, according to Jerome, was a common practice among capitalists in the railroad industry, allowing them to build and profit from large projects without personal financial risk.|"[""1.

Frank and Jerome were discussing a plan involving the railroad. Jerome wanted to manipulate the stock market to profit from Central Sonora's stocks. He proposed selling overpriced stocks to the public, even though the railroad might not be profitable. Frank disagreed, calling the plan dishonest and criminal.

Some people think that only those who drink, smoke, and swear are bad, but that's not always true. Just because someone doesn't have these habits doesn't mean they're mean or rascally. It's natural to assume bad people would have these vices, but it's not always the case. For example, quitting smoking might even help someone improve physically. Different colleges like Harvard and Yale have their own characteristics. Many people in the country are Native Americans, but their living conditions are often tough. In New York, a young man is learning about business from a friend. And don't forget, sometimes it's okay to enjoy simple pleasures like a good cigarette!|"['1.

Frank strongly disliked Mendoza, who he believed was a negative influence on Arthur Hatch.

Unaware of Jalisco's threat, Merry chased after him urgently. Surprising Jalisco, Merry caught up to him at the top of the stairs. Despite Jalisco's attempt to strike him, Merry deflected the blow with ease. Hearing footsteps approaching, Merry thought help was coming. Suddenly, a blanket was thrown over his head, and he was pulled to the ground, losing his grip on Jalisco. When Merry removed the blanket, the lights were on, revealing Mr. Hatch, Arthur, Carlos Mendoza, and some servants nearby. The front door was wide open. Suspecting Jalisco was in New York, Merry described him to the police, warning them to look out for him with Bantry Hagan. Two days passed with no sign of Jalisco. On the third day, Merry met Bantry Hagan, who demanded the police be called off. Bantry warned Merry of Jalisco's dangerous temper. Later, Merry encountered a group of rowdy youngsters, including Warren Hatch's son, at Herald Square. He sought to end their influence on the boy.

Harry Rattleton was frustrated, wondering where the absent person was. He felt someone should talk to him. The group experienced a thrilling ride near a deep gorge, with tracks running close to the edge. They could see the river rushing below. Elsie found it both impressive and frightening.

They decided against visiting the Cave of the Winds due to the cold weather and inadequate waterproof clothing. Instead, they strolled along Goat Island's iron-railed lower edge. As they headed towards the upper end of the island to view the rapids above the falls, they encountered Browning, who was annoyed by a persistent guide. They continued towards the Three Sisters, crossing a bridge over rushing waters that made Elsie nervous. The sight of the water cascading over a semi-circular ridge towards the islands was both thrilling and intimidating.

"""It's a very dangerous feeling,"" Merry smiled. ""An average of sixteen suicides occur yearly at the falls. People are drawn to the rushing water's allure. Often, no clear reason can explain these acts of self-destruction. There are moments when every mind wavers, touched by a fleeting hint of madness. Those standing at great heights may feel an overwhelming urge to jump. Here, they are gripped by a wild desire to plunge into the rapids."" As the fleeing man, recognized by Merry as the one who nearly harmed Inza earlier, passed Frank, he gave a piercing look. Inza, with horror in her eyes, was saved by Frank just in time. Despite being focused on her, Frank soon realized she was safe and turned to chase after the mysterious man who had twice targeted Inza that day."|"['1.
