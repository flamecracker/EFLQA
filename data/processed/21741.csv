One calm morning in the 1800s, the vast Southern Ocean lay still, reflecting the sky above. A boat floated motionless on the mirrored water, with no rowers or helmsman in sight. An albatross circled the boat, eyeing it curiously. Suddenly, a weary young man emerged from the boat, his eyes filled with exhaustion. Beside him, a young girl lay still, her condition uncertain. The young man, Dominick, whispered words of despair and hope, longing for food to sustain his sister, Pauline, and his little brother, Otto. Days of starvation had taken their toll on the boat's occupants, some now dead, including the cabin-boy. Dominick faced a harrowing decision as hunger gnawed at him, contemplating the meager provisions left and the possibility of prolonging his siblings' lives.|"['1.

The young man forcefully threw the knife away and struggled to lift the boy's body, a task that once was easy for him. With great effort, he managed to hoist the body overboard, causing a loud splash that woke the two men in the front of the boat. They were sadly familiar with this sound, having lost many comrades to the sea. One man tried to stand but fell overboard, while the other, desperate to save his friend, also leaped into the water. The youth, named Dominick, comforted a woman named Pauline, assuring her that help was on the way. Despite his initial disappointment, Dominick's faith was renewed when he found a hidden bundle containing food and water. Overjoyed, he shared the provisions but cautioned against overindulging to make them last.|"[""1.

I believe his motive was noble, perhaps to assist his friend. It has been a blessing to us. As his sister and brother slept, Dominick fought off drowsiness to watch for a passing ship. Eventually, sleep overcame him, and they drifted in a peaceful slumber. When he awoke, Dominick spotted a ship on the horizon, but he hesitated to wake the others, fearing disappointment. As the vessel approached, they noticed something odd about it. Their lack of oars prevented them from signaling for help. The ship turned out to be a wreck on a desolate shore, dashing their hopes.|"[""1.

Dominick assured Otto that he wouldn't be grumpy and believed that a good meal and rest had restored the boy's spirit. He decided to consume all their provisions in one meal to gather strength for the upcoming struggle with the surf. As they drifted towards the land, they saw a distant island beyond the sandbank. The approaching waves indicated a challenging moment. Dominick, Pauline, and Otto had a hearty meal, gaining strength for what lay ahead. As they neared the coral reef, the waves grew stronger. Dominick fashioned an oar from a plank and steered the boat cautiously towards the shore. The boat rose and fell with the waves, signaling the imminent danger. Pauline and Otto, fueled by their meal, braced themselves as the boat navigated through the foamy surf towards the shore, where the real challenge awaited them.|"[""1.

As the boat bobbed and surged, Dominick fought to keep it facing the sea. With a rush, a wave grabbed hold, causing chaos. Pauline, knowing how to swim, stayed calm. The next wave engulfed them, tossing Dominick overboard. Amid the chaos, he urged his siblings to cling to the sand. Swept ashore, they clung on as the sea raged. Barely escaping, they ran from the waves crashing behind them. Dominick's quick thinking saved them.|"[""1.

They carried the fainting girl to the shore and laid her on a grassy area beneath a bush. Dominick realized his mistake in thinking the coral reef lacked vegetation. He noticed a grove of coconut palms and dense undergrowth. Excited, Otto expressed his joy at being stranded on an uninhabited island, inspired by tales like Robinson Crusoe. Dominick, while amused, shared Otto's enthusiasm. However, he pointed out the need to use their skills to survive. As they approached a bay, they saw the sea destroying their boat. Despite the setback, they found a water pool and drank from it, feeling a sense of relief. They stumbled upon a skeleton and burial mounds, evidence of past shipwreck victims. Despite the somber discovery, finding water lifted their spirits and momentarily eased their worries about food.|"['1.

Otto was optimistic about finding water and food on the coral island as they ventured through the thicket. Dominick, however, was more cautious, pointing out the limited resources on the small reef. Despite the scarcity, they found some cocoa-nuts, lifting their spirits. As the sun began to set, Dominick suggested looking for a camping spot. Emerging from the thicket, they were greeted by the sun's warm rays, revealing a larger islet across a deep lagoon. Otto, undeterred by challenges, proposed building a raft for unity and safety. Dominick, more practical, warned of the risks. The brothers debated their options, with Otto's carefree attitude contrasting Dominick's concerns. As they observed a flock of birds in the distance, Dominick shared his apprehensions about potential dangers on the island, leading to reflections on their family and the uncertainties ahead.|"[""1.

"""Think!"" exclaimed the boy, indignantly; ""do you think only serious, tall guys like Dom can think? I think so much that sometimes I feel like I'm thinking inside out! Pina, you don't know as much about mother as I do. When you're with her, she only talks about things that interest you. But when it's just me, she ignores me and lets me do what I want. She thinks I'll do it anyway, but I love her more than she knows. It's when she forgets me, or thinks I'm asleep, that she talks to the cat."" Dominick interrupted, ""Let's find a place to sleep before dark. We'll head back to where we landed, search for a cave or overhanging rock.""

"""Oh no,"" cried Pauline, ""I'm sure it was either Wednesday or Tuesday. The wreck and our sufferings in the boat have confused my mind.""""Well, this is quite a mess,"" said Otto, half asleep. ""We've lost a day, can't agree on others, and Dom thinks he gained a week! How will we know when Sunday is? It's a real puzzle."" Otto's snoring indicated he had fallen asleep again, followed by Pauline and Dominick. Nature kept them asleep until sunrise the next day. Dominick woke up energized, declaring himself a ""new man.""

Dominick had miscalculated the size of the reef, which turned out to be much larger than expected. Initially viewed as a mere sandbank with some vegetation from sea level, upon reaching the highest point, they discovered an extensive lagoon with smaller islets, some with coconut palms. A large island stood in the background, protected by the irregular coral reef. As they explored, they encountered various sea-birds and waterfowl. The group buried a skeleton found in a thicket near the graves of others, but no clues to their identities were uncovered. The conversation turned to the need for an army to defend a queen and prime minister, leading to playful banter among the explorers. Pauline's thoughts drifted to her family back in England, imagining her mother and father eagerly awaiting news of their children's adventures.|"['1.

Queen Pina regained hope as she believed a passing ship would rescue them from the island. Her eyes dried, allowing her to observe her kingdom clearly. Suddenly, shouts from the army and familiar cries arose from a clump of reeds. Chief among the noise were a large sow and a group of little pigs in a wild state of alarm. The army pursued them, resulting in chaos and falls. Otto, in pursuit of a small pig, stumbled over a root and fell on it with force. Despite the commotion, they discovered a thicket with domestic fowls that likely descended from a wreck. Returning in the evening, they found a garden with vegetables, including sweet potatoes. Excited for a royal feast, they faced a challenge - the need for light in the golden cave. Pauline, unfamiliar with such tasks, pondered a solution for their predicament.|['1.

Otto suggested a plan to start a fire by gathering dry grass and dead sticks, but the group struggled to find a way to light it. The trio then decided to build a raft to reach a nearby wreck for supplies. They collected spars and planks from a bay filled with wreckage caused by ocean currents. Despite the challenges of building a raft large enough to transport supplies, they managed to construct one using worn cordage and rusty nails. The brothers set off on the raft towards the wreck, hoping to find food and essential items. Upon reaching the wreck, they discovered a scene of desolation, with evidence of a fire engulfing the vessel. Despite the charred remains, they continued their search for supplies, uncertain of what they might find.|"[""1.

Otto and Dominick found themselves stranded on a wrecked vessel, with little hope of survival. Despite the devastation caused by fire and the loss of valuable supplies, they managed to salvage burnt bedding to start a fire. As they explored the wreck, they found little of value except for the charred remains of the sailors' belongings. Despite their dire situation, the brothers maintained a positive outlook, making the best of their circumstances. Otto reassured his sister, Pauline, that their mother would not worry too soon as their location was remote, and passing ships might rescue them eventually. The boys' resilience and resourcefulness in the face of adversity gave them hope for the future, even as they faced the challenges of their new island home.|"['1.

Dominick demonstrated how to make cordage from tree bark to his sister before cutting a stout cane. He advised against imitation and stressed the importance of acting according to one's nature. Despite Otto's concerns, Dominick proceeded to build a ladder by securing bamboo to the tree with pegs. He climbed up, securing each step until he reached the lower branches. Otto fetched more bamboo as needed, and together they completed the ladder, allowing them to access the higher parts of the tree. Dominick's practical skills and determination were evident as he constructed the ladder efficiently and safely.|"['1.

Long ago, Otto wished to complete a task despite lacking tools. He craved an axe to fell trees easily. Pauline suggested making a flint axe and an iron one. Dominick struggled to find a suitable flint, but with perseverance, he split one successfully. He then crafted a handle from a strong tree branch and attached the flint head securely. Otto, on the other hand, faced challenges in fashioning an iron axe due to the wreck's limited resources. The siblings embarked on the task, with Dominick using flint and Otto attempting an iron axe.

Dominick cautiously wielded the axe against a tree, elated as wood chips flew. Fearful of damaging it, he headed triumphantly to the golden cave. Meanwhile, Otto, launching a raft, scoured the wreck for the right iron piece. Spotting iron plates from the ship's davit sockets, he crafted a formidable double-edged axe. The trio, pleased with their work, debated the merits of the axes over supper. As time passed, they lost track until Pauline's bark-record revealed two months had gone by.

As the brothers emerged from their hiding place, they had to brace themselves against the strong wind to avoid being carried away. Taking refuge behind a bush, they scanned the area but could only make out the silhouettes of bending trees and rushing foam. The darkness obscured their view of the land, but any object against the night sky stood out starkly. They immediately spotted the familiar wreck near the bay's edge, but next to it was an unfamiliar sight that stirred a mix of emotions in them. Now, let's travel back in time and out to sea. On a stormy night, an emigrant ship battled the gale, its sails and rigging damaged. The captain, unsure of their position, faced a mutinous crew and whispers of a plot against him. Amidst the chaos, a tragic accident claimed the captain's life, leaving the ship to sail on uncontrollably.|"['1.

"""Lookee here now, Mister Malines,"" said Joe, with a mild, even kindly expression, which was the very reverse of belligerent; ""I was always a law-abiding man myself, and don't have any love for fighting; but when I'm ordered to go into a dark hole, and have the lid shut down on me and locked, I feel a sort of objection, d'ee see.

During these weeks, the appearance of Big Island's shores started to change significantly. Near Silver Bay, several bright green patches were enclosed by rough but effective fences, forming the community's gardens. Sweet potatoes, yams, and other vegetables grew naturally, while some northern hemisphere crops were already sown and sprouting. After finishing planting, the people began constructing huts of various shapes and sizes. Challenges of civilization emerged early on, discussed during informal meetings at Silver Bay. Nobbs, the blacksmith, voiced concerns about working without reward, sparking a debate. Dominick proposed a temporary solution where everyone would take turns helping the blacksmiths and each other until a more permanent plan was established. The community rallied behind the idea, volunteering to support one another. Pauline, asleep nearby, was awakened by the cheers, ready to face the challenges ahead.|"['1.

Pauline found it hard to believe that she was to become a queen despite the serious arguments presented to her. Her brother Otto informed her that the coronation was set for the following Monday and a new palace was being built. The new palace had three rooms, including one for Pauline, one for the Prime Minister Dominick, and one for the Court Physician Dr. John Marsh. Otto assured Pauline of the community's earnestness in making her queen and highlighted her importance in uniting the rough and rowdy elements of the community. However, the preparations for the coronation faced challenges due to the lack of experience in organizing such an event. To address this, a national assembly was called to discuss the details, with men focusing on the arrangements while women and babies were placed in an outer circle during the discussions.|"[""1.

On Big Island, the human family was bustling with excitement and secrecy. Mrs. Nobbs, Mrs. Welsh, and Widow Lynch were crafting a magnificent crown for a surprise coronation. Dr. Marsh, a privileged man, admired the crown and offered to carry it to the ceremony. Meanwhile, a group of men, led by Dr. Marsh, prepared to crown Pauline in a secret location. At the palace, Pauline was getting ready for the event. Nearby, a band of conspirators, led by Otto Rigonda, had set up a makeshift cannon to add to the festivities.

The crowd cheered with a mix of laughter as the trumpets struggled to sound. The doctor, armed with his men, appeared with the crown. The people were so impressed that they fell silent. Pauline, the new queen, looked modest and innocent. She was crowned by the doctor and declared her rule would be guided by truth and righteousness. Unexpectedly, she appointed Joe Binney as her Prime Minister, causing cheers and laughter. Chaos erupted when the men stole liquor and began a wild party.

The rioters cheered wildly as the blacksmith triumphantly destroyed his enemy's casks, setting them ablaze. The entire settlement watched in excitement, alarm, or horror. Widow Lynch joined the blacksmith, encouraging his actions. Nobbs, realizing the ludicrousness of the situation, laughed and smashed more casks. His ferocity stemmed from past struggles with alcohol. As he fought the symbolic fiend, the people watched in silence. Nobbs, driven by rage, destroyed all the liquor. His strength became his weakness, but his paroxysm of rage destroyed the evil influence. The onlookers, too drunk or surprised to interfere, witnessed the destruction. After collapsing, Nobbs was cared for, and his wife prayed for his recovery. The next day, Otto questioned the queen's choice of premier, suggesting Dom would have been a better option.|"[""1.

The queen, engrossed in sketching, found solace in drawing. Her brother, steering the boat gently, maintained a peaceful silence. The weather was cool, enhancing the sunny day. The sea and lagoon were calm, mirroring the islets. The quiet was broken by bird calls and the ocean's distant rumble. Pauline, finishing her sketch, likened the sound to the ocean's soothing voice. Otto, less imaginative, compared it to a sleeping giant. Playfully, Pauline suggested titles for Otto in the royal household. Otto preferred being a page. Pauline planned to educate settlers' children and mothers with the help of Redding, a former schoolmaster, and Dr. Marsh. Otto reflected on his mother, hoping to see her soon.|"['1.

Pauline expressed hope when Dr. Marsh proposed building a schooner from the wreck to sail to England. She joked about a cat speaking vowels.

For a while, only the rhythmic sound of the oars and the rush of water broke the silence as the crew strained in pursuit.

Otto and Queen Pina recounted their daring escape from the chief with the swelled nose on the islet. The chief had tried to harm them, but their swimming and diving skills saved them. Back at Big Island, the widow Lynch welcomed Pauline warmly. Meanwhile, a cabinet council was held in the palace where the queen suggested a motto for their constitution. However, their meeting was interrupted by a knock at the door. Otto, who had been keeping watch on the conspirators, appeared with urgent news. He revealed that Malines had joined the conspirators to seize the wrecked ship.

""Not so fast, Hugh,"" Dominick retorted, smiling pleasantly but somewhat perplexing and exasperating. ""You're the one heading into the lagoon, and I'm here to assist you.""

In the early days of the colony, a criminal court was hastily established, with Dr. Marsh as the judge, chosen for his limited legal knowledge. A jury of twelve men was randomly picked, and young Buxley acted as the public prosecutor. Despite the need for defense, Redding was selected by chance to represent the accused. Amidst the trial's chaos, with the jury overstepping its role and the prosecutor suggesting punishments, Redding stood out by advocating for mercy and justice from the Bible. Ultimately, the guilty were sentenced to imprisonment.

"""I don't know,"" the queen said, as the room quieted, ""who in my household is responsible for freeing forgiven men. So, I command the prime minister to cut their bonds.""

Beyond the rocks, Malone warned the widow to take Brown-eyes to safety as the settlers hurried towards the danger. Hidden behind the rocks, a group of savages armed with clubs and spears planned a surprise attack on the settlement. Brown-eyes had unknowingly discovered them, prompting the settlers to take action. The chief of the savages prepared to attack Malone with a spear, but when he saw the settlers armed with guns, he and his comrades fled to their canoe. Despite a chase, the savages managed to escape.

There was no time for celebration. The sea, once turbulent, now churned in wild waves without wind. Big Island was sinking, crumbling into the water. The volcano rumbled continuously with frequent explosions. Darkness deepened as the island descended, engulfed by the tumultuous sea. A stout cable, under divine intervention, saved them from imminent peril. The ship tossed like a cork on the raging flood until the chain snapped. Amidst fire, water, and chaos, a calm eventually prevailed. With gratitude, they dropped a second anchor in the thick darkness. Pauline Rigonda, once Island Queen, now sat on the ship's deck, gazing at the calm sea. Despite disappointment, the settlers, led by Malines and Morris, continued their journey to the original port. The young ones accepted the situation gracefully, learning to make the best of challenging circumstances.|"['1.

In pursuit of comfort, an elderly man groaned, squeezed his forehead, and stared sternly at a book. The old lady sighed deeply, and even the cat let out a weak meow. The man expressed frustration about earthquakes, wishing they could split the world in two to rid the earth of subterranean fires. Suddenly, a cab arrived at the door, causing a commotion. The room filled with voices, footsteps, and shrieks. The cat, startled, perched on a bookcase. Amid the chaos, the man found himself embraced by the ex-queen, the old lady hugged by others, and the cat puffed up in alarm. The man declared it all a dream and preferred not to wake up.
