"Rebecca scolded her sister Anna for calling her ""Rebby"" instead of ""Flora,"" and expressed her disinterest in seeing far lands, as their father had praised the beauty of their Province's shores. Rebecca often wished Anna were a boy, as she preferred being called ""Dan"" and enjoyed activities like deep-sea fishing and tramping in the woods with their father, which Rebecca avoided. Anna looked like a forest girl in her deerskin skirt and moccasins. Passing the blacksmith shop, they heard Mr. Foster working on forks for hay and grain.

Mrs. Weston explained the significance of the liberty pole in defending their homes against threats to American liberty. Anna eagerly prepared for the expedition, while Rebecca worried about the delayed arrival of the _Polly_ and the implications of the liberty pole discussion.

Luretta preferred traveling by land rather than by sea. She mentioned that the ship, Polly, was bringing gifts for Melvina Lyon, the minister's daughter, from her sister in Boston.

Rebecca and Lucia were startled by the absence of the liberty pole in their town. Rebecca mentioned that loyal settlements were putting up liberty poles along the coast, and Machias planned to set up a liberty tree once the British gunboat left. Lucia felt puzzled as to why her father didn't want Machias to have a liberty tree. Unbeknownst to Lucia, her father was negotiating with the British for trade. The next morning, Mr. Weston found the door unbarred and learned about the missing liberty tree. Paul Foster informed Mr. Weston that the pine sapling was gone. Mrs. Weston suspected a traitor was behind the disappearance. Rebecca, feeling guilty, fell ill and stayed in bed while Anna went to Luretta Foster's house.|"['1.

Mrs. Foster declared the need for loyalty as Boston fell to the British. She decided to walk to the wharves with her daughter, Melvina, to hear news about a traitor. As they approached, cheers erupted as Mr. Weston and Mr. Foster rowed towards the shore with a pine sapling. Mr. Weston asked Mrs. Foster to look after Melvina, as he rushed to help with the sacred tree. Melvina's presence eased Anna and Luretta's guilt over a past game. Melvina's friendly demeanor put them at ease. Mrs. Foster left Melvina with Anna and Luretta, who sat on a log. Melvina eagerly asked Anna to share stories about animals. Luretta suggested that Anna and Melvina visit her rabbits, Trit and Trot, while she waited for Melvina's father.

Anna and Melvina agreed to play together near a log as instructed by Mrs. Foster. Melvina proposed a race to the blacksmith shop, and Anna, always ready for fun, agreed. As they raced, Melvina surprisingly won, showing a change in her behavior. Anna, who had been trying to be more like Melvina, noticed this change. Melvina, in turn, wanted to be more like Anna.

Anna whispered to Melvina to hurry and run as Mrs. Foster was approaching. The two girls dashed behind the shed, clutching the trembling rabbits, then sprinted across the fields towards Mr. Lyon's house. Only upon reaching the back door of the parsonage did they remember Luretta. Melvina assured Anna that Luretta wouldn't leave for a while, giving them time to return the rabbits safely. Inside, Melvina excitedly planned to dress up the dolls with the rabbits. They had a delightful time playing until London approached, causing the rabbits to escape out the window.

Anna, usually bold, surprised everyone with her meekness as she decided to walk home with Luretta. Melvina, feeling a bit scared after their morning adventure, was unsure how to explain their mischief to Luretta. Just then, London entered the front entryway. Mr. Lyon sharply reprimanded London for talking about wicked things, even though Melvina found it amusing. London, convinced he had witnessed something strange and terrible, vowed to discuss it with Mr. Lyon later. Anna, worried about the missing rabbits Trit and Trot, remembered her ill sister Rebecca at home. Feeling guilty for leading Melvina into trouble before, Anna decided to take all the blame for the lost rabbits.

The table was set with shiny pewter plates. There was white bread, a rare treat in the settlement, a fine omelet, boiled rice with raisins, and guava jelly. Rebecca, despite feeling hungry, abruptly left the Horton's dinner. When she returned home, she found comfort in simple cornbread and boiled fish. Anna shared her day's events, including losing the rabbits and Luretta's anger. Anna's mother advised her to confess her mistakes to Luretta and Mrs. Foster.
