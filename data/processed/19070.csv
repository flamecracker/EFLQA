In the early 15th century, England faced turbulent times. Owen Glendower wreaked havoc in the Welsh marches, seizing English strongholds and repelling invasions. Douglas invaded the northern borders, causing destruction until defeated at Homildon by Northumberland and Hotspur. A coalition formed to overthrow the king, but the battle of Shrewsbury ended their plans. The unrest between England and Wales led to many adventures. A boy stood on a lookout tower of a border fort, built for defense over comfort. The stone square building had narrow loopholes and a door ten feet high accessible by retractable wooden steps. This period of chronic warfare was filled with dramatic tales, much like the one the hero experienced.|['1.

The fortress was solidly built, with a flat stone roof and a lookout tower rising above it. The main floor housed the lord's family, while the basement stored food and supplies. The courtyard was surrounded by a high wall with turrets at each corner. The construction, except for the door, was entirely of stone to withstand attacks. The hold was in a wild country, challenging to access due to deep ravines and valleys. Oswald, a boy in the household, stood lookout for his father's return with a strong band of spearmen. As the group approached, Oswald noticed some horsemen without spears among them. The scene depicted a tense atmosphere of anticipation and vigilance in a remote and rugged landscape.|"[""1.

Oswald grew up knowing that attacks were common in his area. The fortalice was always guarded, especially on dark, misty nights, as Scottish borderers could strike at any time. Truces between border wardens had little effect on the prickers, small chieftains who were in constant warfare. Scottish forays were more frequent due to poverty, relying on plunder for survival. Both sides shared mixed Danish and Anglo-Saxon heritage. Norman blood mixed in on the English side through marriages with dispossessed families. Wars with the Scots kept a martial spirit alive. Retaliation for injuries was seen as natural. Raids were allowed across the border, and blood feuds existed between families. The Forsters and Bairds had a long-standing feud, leading to reprisals and losses on both sides. The border was ill-defined, and families settled on either side. Feuds could arise from past raids, leading to bitter reprisals. Oswald saw the animals being driven in, signaling the Bairds' pursuit. He quickly alerted the men to arm themselves.|"[""1.

Mary Forster and her son waited at the top of the steps to welcome the men returning from a battle. The gate to the yard was strategically placed opposite the fortalice's doorway, ensuring attackers faced archers before reaching the building. Despite losses and injuries, the men managed to drive off cattle and defend against pursuers. The skirmish resulted in casualties on both sides, with William Baird's forces eventually retreating. The men quickly sought refuge, and the wounded were tended to by the women using bandages and ointments. The group rode fast, breaking into smaller parties to evade pursuit. The narrative highlights the valor and resilience of the defenders as they outmaneuvered their adversaries.|"[""1.

Oswald was instructed by his mother to unfasten the harness. She planned to tend to his father's arm and head injuries, while Elspeth would fetch tankards of beer for all. A sip of beer, they believed, would work wonders. Once the wounds were dressed, they all had bowls of porridge. One man kept watch, and after tending to the cattle, everyone settled down to rest. Oswald's mother, pondering the ongoing conflicts, expressed doubts about ever achieving peace. Oswald, understanding the situation, explained the constant need to defend against raids and thefts. Despite the ongoing border skirmishes, he highlighted the camaraderie that existed during periods of truce. Oswald acknowledged the shared history and friendships that bridged the divide between the English and the Scots, except for those with deep-seated feuds.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat did Oswald's mother instruct him to do?\nA) Fetch tankards of beer\nB) Tend to his father's injuries\nC) Keep watch\nD) Dress the wounds\nE) Tend to the cattle"", ""Question 2:\nWhat was Elspeth's role in the situation?\nA) Tend to the cattle\nB) Fetch tankards of beer\nC) Keep watch\nD) Dress the wounds\nE) Rest with everyone"", 'Question 3:\nWhat did they believe would work wonders?\nA) Tending to the cattle\nB) A sip of beer\nC) Resting\nD) Dressing the wounds\nE) Pondering the conflicts', 'Question 4:\nWhat did everyone have after the wounds were dressed?\nA) Porridge\nB) Beer\nC) Cattle\nD) Tankards\nE) Rest', ""Question 5:\nWhat did Oswald's mother express doubts about achieving?\nA) Raid defense\nB) Peace\nC) Camaraderie\nD) Truce\nE) Shared history"", 'Question 6:\nWhat did Oswald explain was the constant need?\nA) Raid defense\nB) Peace\nC) Camaraderie\nD) Truce\nE) Shared history']"|"[""B) Tend to his father's injuries"", 'B) Fetch tankards of beer', 'B) A sip of beer', 'A) Porridge', 'B) Peace', 'A) Raid defense']"
In the borderlands, life is fraught with danger as pillagers often target towns for plunder. While the southern parts of England remain peaceful, the threat of Scottish raids looms large in the north. Oswald's mother, haunted by past losses, fears for her family's safety.

Oswald, a young lad from Northumbria, was eager to join his father, Allan Baird, in defending their land against the fierce William Baird. Despite his desire to fight, his father knew he was not yet ready. Oswald spent his days practicing with weapons and exploring the rugged terrain of the borderlands. His father emphasized the importance of strength and skill, cautioning him against the ruthless Bairds.

The boy, Oswald, was discouraged from pursuing learning by his father, who believed practical skills were more valuable than reading and writing. His mother had suggested that Oswald spend time in a convent to learn, which his father adamantly opposed. Oswald's father, John, considered the idea absurd and felt his son was better suited for practical pursuits. John's vigilance was heightened due to an ongoing feud with the Bairds, and the hold was closely guarded. Despite his mother's influence, Oswald never pursued the idea further. Eventually, Oswald set off alone to visit the Armstrongs, riding through various landscapes to reach his destination. The Armstrongs' hold was smaller but strategically positioned for defense.

In the past, the border was troubled by three men causing chaos, leading to occasional cattle thefts and border wars every few years. Despite this, there were periods of peace in between. One significant event occurred in 1388 when England faced internal turmoil, prompting France to resume hostilities. Men were summoned to Jedburgh forest, including an Armstrong, setting off with a heavy heart as a peaceful man. The group, led by Douglas, March, and Moray, pillaged Northumberland, causing destruction. The battle intensified at Otterburn, where a fierce skirmish ensued with the Percys. Despite setbacks, the Scots fought bravely, especially Douglas and Sir Patrick Hepburn, rallying against the English forces.

In the battle, the young earl fought fiercely, cutting through the English ranks, but was fatally wounded. His knights and squires followed, but only a few saw his brave charge. Unaware of his fall, the English were spared a morale boost. Meanwhile, other Scottish leaders like March and Moray held their ground. Sir Ralph Percy was wounded and captured. The Scots, rested and fresh, turned the tide against the weary English. Sir James Lindsay and Sir Walter Sinclair, following Douglas' last command, rallied under his banner.

Oswald, Allan, and Janet set out early for the hills with their four dogs, armed with bows and arrows to hunt hares. They returned after six hours with five hares and a brace of birds. They used bows to shoot the game while on the ground, as shooting flying game was not considered unsportsmanlike in those days. They also flew hawks to hunt, with the birds beating and pecking at the hares until the hunting party could dispatch them with arrows. However, news of King Richard's deposition and the turmoil in England led Adam Armstrong to advise Oswald to cut short his visit. Troubles between lords in Scotland and England were brewing, hinting at potential conflicts and signaling the need to suspend friendships across borders.

"""You are rarely changed, Oswald,"" his uncle said as the boy entered his apartment. ""'Tis three years since I last saw you, and you have shot up nigh a head since then.

Oswald's uncle suggested he spend time at a monastery to learn reading and writing, skills crucial in medieval times. Many lords and knights could barely sign their names. The chaplain at the castle advised that with dedication, Oswald could learn to write and read basic letters within a year. While spoken messages sufficed, written orders were vital for accuracy and record-keeping. Oswald agreed to study with the chaplain's assistance. His uncle, Alwyn Forster, arranged for new clothes and armor suitable for a young nobleman. Oswald's interest in learning was supported by his uncle and the chaplain, who noted that a monk, Friar Roger, would aid him in his studies. Oswald's journey towards literacy and education began with these preparations.|"['1.

The priest and Oswald went to the monastery, leaving Alwyn Forster in charge of the men-at-arms. Oswald wanted to see Friar Roger and was led to a waiting room where the tall and powerful monk soon joined them. The friar looked more like a warrior than a monk. He agreed to teach Oswald to read and write, warning him of his lack of patience. Oswald accepted the challenge and promised to work hard. The monk appreciated Oswald's spirit and agreed to train him. The monk was known for his short temper and dislike for weak boys sent to become monks. He arranged for Oswald to train with him in arms in the morning and afternoon. The monk had a booming voice that often disrupted the chapel services, leading to his request to be excused from attending. The priest sought permission from the abbot for the monk to teach Oswald, which was easily granted due to the abbot's warlike nature and fondness for the monk.|"['1.

In the past, vast amounts of arrows and stones were readied for defense against a Scottish invasion. The governor instructed people to seek refuge, with men defending the castle and women and children fleeing to the hills. The Scots initially overpowered all, including capturing Oswald's father's stronghold without a fight. Oswald was relieved as resistance could have led to a massacre. The Percys were absent, and it would take time to gather a force to counter the Scots. The Scottish army besieged the historic Wark Castle, which had seen many conflicts over the years. Another group of Scots plundered the Coquet valley. Sir Robert Umfraville's force defeated the Scots at Fulhetlaw, capturing key figures. Despite the turmoil, Oswald continued studying diligently with his monk instructor, striving to meet expectations even when facing challenges with spelling.|"['1.

Oswald's education progressed rapidly under the monk's guidance. Despite struggling to write due to his prior training in martial exercises, he could read and write simple words after three months. The monk was pleased with his progress. Oswald was eager to meet the returning Percys and was excited about the potential opportunities. The monk regretted the interruption in Oswald's learning but understood the demands of the family's return. The castle buzzed with activity upon the Percys' arrival, with torches lighting the courtyard as the Earl of Northumberland and his son returned with their men-at-arms. Oswald marveled at the impressive appearance of the Earl and his knights, contrasting it with the roughness of border warfare. The men-at-arms were a varied group, lacking the uniformity seen in modern armies. Oswald was captivated by the grandeur of the martial display.|"[""1.

Oswald's uncle, the captain of the castle's men-at-arms, attended a banquet after the troops arrived, leaving Oswald free to mingle with soldiers. He listened to their tales of London and the celebrations for the new king, sparking envy among those left behind.

Light steel caps with cheek, gorgets, shoulder and arm pieces, and padded leather jerkins were worn; then, with blunted swords, they faced each other. The squire stood confidently. A good swordsman, he planned to go easy on the lad and play before scoring. But Oswald took the offense, making Marsden defend fiercely. Oswald's agility was impressive, always moving, attacking, and retreating swiftly. When Oswald tired, Marsden took charge, pushing him back. The squire, impressed by Oswald's speed and stamina, noted his fighting style was like a wildcat. Although Oswald fought with agility, he needed to learn knightly swordsmanship for battles.

Hotspur expressed his satisfaction, stating that he would now feel more at ease sending Oswald on dangerous missions requiring combat training. He acknowledged that Oswald lacked the necessary skills for such tasks and might not fare well against heavily armed opponents. Oswald himself admitted that he could only withstand a lance attack, not a fully armored foe with a sword and mace. Hotspur advised Oswald to wear protective gear and use his horse's agility to evade attacks. Oswald then prepared a makeshift weapon by wrapping his spearhead with cloth and chalk. The scene unfolded in a courtyard as the combatants, Sinclair and Oswald, mounted their horses, one heavily armored and the other lightly equipped.

Oswald, addressing Hotspur, defended the squire's actions during the combat. He explained that the squire was at a disadvantage due to his helmet blocking out Hotspur's voice. Once the helmet was removed, a soldier splashed water on the squire's face to revive him. Hotspur commended the squire for the lesson learned in combat, acknowledging the advantages of a nimble opponent on horseback. Reflecting on past encounters with the Scots, Hotspur realized their tactics and vowed to adapt his strategy accordingly. Oswald, having observed the combat, praised the lad's agility and skill in border exercises. Hotspur recognized the importance of individual combat skills and the need for adaptability in battle.

Oswald quickly realized the benefits of his new role as an esquire to Lord Percy. Previously treated as a mere messenger, he now enjoyed the courtesy of sitting at the high table, mingling with the ladies, and being seen as a trusted confidant. Despite his youth, his merit was evident as Lord Percy wouldn't have chosen him otherwise. Oswald's journeys took him near Yardhope, where the fort was being rebuilt with the help of villagers preparing for a potential Scottish invasion.

Lord Percy had a delicate task ahead. He needed to send a message to the Earl of March, a nobleman from Scotland. The message was crucial, as it could lead to a significant alliance between the two. To ensure secrecy, the message was not to be written down, as any mishap could trigger unwanted actions. Lord Percy selected a young man named Oswald for this mission. Oswald was to travel to Dunbar, meet the earl, and assess his trustworthiness. Lord Percy emphasized the need for caution and secrecy. Oswald was to carry a ring and a token from Lord Percy to gain access to the earl. After receiving detailed instructions, Oswald burned the paper to keep the mission confidential.

Sir Philip thanked Oswald but Oswald said he would continue his journey in the morning. He mentioned that he had already stayed at the Golden Rose and it would draw attention if he came there.

Oswald had ordered his supper and a flask of wine before dressing as a trader and heading downstairs. As he entered the room where several people were seated, a soldier walked in from the outer door. He surveyed the room, pondering what name to use. The soldier inquired about Master Micklethwaite, a trader who often arranged supplies for the earl's retainers in Dunbar. The conversation turned to the impact of wars on trade and the uncertainty of the future. The landlord expressed concerns about the English raids and the potential ruin it could bring to their town. Despite the looming war, they hoped for peace, questioning the necessity of conflicts between countries.

"""It would indeed be a rare thing,"" Sanderson remarked. ""The ill feeling between the borders is fueled by thieving loons on both sides. If people were settled in waste tracts to raise crops and cattle, rather than destroy each other's livelihood, there would be less loss. Sadly, in our time, we must make the best of things as they are. The English coming north to capture Edinburgh may disrupt trade, but venturing to France for service could be an option. Regardless of the outcome, men will continue to eat, drink, and trade. The Scots invading England might lead to a familiar cycle of invasion and reprisal, affecting innocent people the most. It's a shame the cities have no say in peace and war decisions. While peace may be temporary, the English claims to authority in Scotland linger. The towns and countryside would unite to repel any invasion if given a choice. The past has shown that cities often succumb to invasions due to the influence of garrisons rather than the townspeople.

Hotspur told Roger that he would arrange with the abbot for him to leave the monastery and join the garrison, but he must continue wearing his monk's robe while at the monastery to avoid being recognized.

A month passed, and the Earl of March arrived at Alnwick by sea. Douglas and the regent had marched against him with a strong force. They were enemies, and the Earl knew his fate would be sealed if captured. He openly declared himself a vassal of the English king to avoid falling into their hands.

Upon reaching the castle, the Ruthyn troops were warmly welcomed by the seneschal of Lord William Beauchamp, the ruler of Abergavenny. Chirk Castle, a grand structure with five flanking towers, stood tall on a high hill, providing a breathtaking view of seventeen counties. The castle's immense strength made it impervious to Welsh attacks. The estate of Glendower, near the Dee Valley, boasted a guest house and a church, showcasing the grandeur of a nobleman's residence. Glendower's hospitality was renowned, especially among bards who sang his praises and foretold his greatness. Glendower's house, Sycharth, was surrounded by a moat and a wall, demonstrating his commitment to peace between the English and Welsh. Despite his defiance of the king, Glendower's residence lacked defensive fortifications, relying instead on a lone watchman for protection.

Alwyn returned to Alnwick after his leave ended. He spent time quietly at the hold discussing plans to strengthen its defenses. They concluded that while it could defend against small parties, it would yield to an invading army. Occasionally, they held sports on the moor, inviting neighbors for riding, wrestling, and more. Over a thousand people gathered, competing eagerly in various events. Ralph won the horse race, Percy's man excelled in shooting, Long Hackett won the quarterstaff prize, and Roger triumphed in wrestling. After the sports, a feast followed with roasting meats and barrels of beer. The day ended with music, dancing, and border lays sung by minstrels.

While traveling across the hills, Oswald and Roger reached the northern road near the Bairds' hold. They decided to dismount and have the men return with the horses to rest in the hills until the afternoon. The plan was for one of them to come down to the road near the village every evening from seven to nine. If no one passed by, they would return to their lodging. As they arrived at a small village close to the Bairds' hold, they went to an ale house for food. The monk, who was on his way to Carlisle to visit his brother, engaged in conversation with the host about the stronghold nearby. The host warned the monk about the fierce reputation of the raider living there and suggested it might be best to avoid seeking shelter there. The monk shared his reasons for carrying a staff and his journey to see his brother. He also mentioned his search for new employment south of the border. The host explained the lifestyle of the Bairds' followers, emphasizing that war was not their primary focus.|"[""1.

Oswald preferred living among others rather than in solitude. He mentioned that living in a hut on the moors did not appeal to him, and he would rather have companions to talk and joke with. The man he spoke to suggested that if he sought fighting, he could find it nearby with the Bairds. The men discussed the border customs of Scotland, where clans often fought amongst themselves. One man expressed a preference for fair fights rather than surprise attacks. They talked about following their chiefs in battles against various foes.

"""He is a lookout,"" he thought, ""and is probably watching a road from Kelso and Jedburgh.

The man asked the sentry to inform William Baird that a tired monk traveling from Dunbar to Carlisle seeks shelter for a day or two. The message was delivered to Baird, who was pleased with the success of the raid on the Armstrongs led by his cousin. Baird had a feud with the Armstrongs, worsened by their ties with English neighbors. He was preparing for a raid into England and had no intention of heeding any complaints from the Armstrongs. Baird considered using the captured Armstrong daughters as bargaining chips or for marriages. Ill-treating them would provoke backlash.

The priest's doubts disappeared as Roger read effortlessly, impressing the priest with his skill. Roger expressed concern for the priest's safety among lawless men who lacked respect for the church.

Oswald had a plan to help the girls escape from the castle. He had a rope hidden in the stable that could reach from the turret to the ground.

Roger and Oswald worked together to subdue the sentry. Oswald bound the sentry's hands and ankles with a rope he had brought. They then trussed him up securely. Roger ensured the sentry couldn't make a sound by placing a piece of wood in his mouth and tying it in place. Afterward, they found a trapdoor, knocked on it, and lifted it open to reveal Janet and Jessie. Roger secured a rope outside the turret for them to descend.

In just a few minutes, they reached the base of the cliff. Oswald shook the rope vigorously to signal those above that they had descended. He then untied the rope connecting him to his cousin, who sat down, crying uncontrollably. Oswald comforted her, assuring her they wouldn't abandon her to the Bairds without a fight. Carefully navigating the steep terrain, they hurried down, wary of alerting their pursuers. As they reached flat ground, they sprinted towards the village. In the distance, they heard shouts and a horn, followed by a blazing light at the hold. Realizing they couldn't make it to Parton, they decided to cross the Esk River and seek refuge in the hills. They swiftly undressed to keep dry and warm, carrying their clothes across the river. Hiding behind a rock, they evaded detection by the passing horsemen.|"['1.

Roger, we must decide our next move carefully. The Bairds are close behind with horsemen and will search the hills for us. We need to find a sheltered spot to hide.

The Bairds are searching with torches. We planned to hide for a few days and then ride through Parton at night. We will need to be cautious as the countryside will be searching for us.

Oswald hurried back to his companions, deciding that the plateau itself was the best spot to hide. He wanted to ensure they were safe from any prying eyes above. They needed to find a secure place before daylight. Oswald directed the girls to lie down two hundred yards away, hidden among the heather. He and Roger dismantled their shelter to avoid detection. The girls were instructed to find a spot close to where the ground dropped away. Oswald and Roger gathered their belongings and headed in the direction of Yardhope.

After a long night's rest, the group decided to move on. Oswald led the way cautiously, keeping an eye out for any signs of danger. As they rode through Parton, the town was eerily quiet, everyone still asleep. They rode on, sticking to the plan of Janet riding the fourth horse, with Jessie alternating between walking and riding behind the others. The group remained vigilant, ready to defend themselves if needed. As the sun rose, they reached a fork in the road, one leading to a ferry and the other following the Liddel River.

John asked about the ferry but was told it no longer operated due to low traffic caused by ongoing troubles. They had decided to cross at a ford four miles away. Finding a deserted hut, they sheltered there for the night. In the morning, they set out again on their horses. As they neared a building used as a refuge by the river, two men armed with swords emerged. The party quickly rode into the water to escape. Pursued by six armed men, they galloped away.

Father Forster was keeping Oswald in the loop because he believed his mother was informing the girls about their mother's tragedy. Oswald had only disclosed the burning of the hold and Allan's injury to the girls to avoid overwhelming them with grief before their journey. Oswald's father acknowledged that women were better suited to deliver such news with empathy. Meanwhile, Roger, their loyal aide, had shared the same news with the moss troopers. Roger humbly credited Oswald for his intelligence and leadership, dismissing his own role in executing orders faithfully. Oswald, in turn, praised Roger's critical role in their recent rescue mission. The conversation shifted to the value of learning, with Roger recognizing its importance after recent events proved its worth.

Glendower, a powerful noble, holds Lord Grey to ransom for money to sustain his armed men. Grey, favored by the king, is crucial to hold territories against Welsh threats.

Glendower's bold actions hint at a growing insurrection, possibly aligning with the Scots. Oswald, tasked to gather intelligence, sets out with a monk and couriers.

Harold's strategy to deal with the Welsh rebellion was by keeping a small group of 150 men with him, knowing that if he lit beacon fires, thousands would join the cause. Oswald's life in Ludlow mirrored that at Alnwick, practicing arms, jousting, and aiding the garrison. Glendower's attacks on Montgomery and Welshpool suburbs caused great loss and outrage. Glendower's alliance with the bards, who used songs to incite rebellion, was a significant factor. The capture of New Radnor castle, with the garrison beheaded and the town destroyed, sent shockwaves through Ludlow. Sir Edmund Mortimer recognized the political impact of these brutal actions, as they spread fear and prompted desertion among Welsh supporters.

During the Welsh rebellion, the garrisons of many castles dwindled as they fell without a fight. In Ludlow, precautions were taken by expelling all Welshmen from the town and purging the garrison. However, Mortimer, the English lord, spared the loyal Welsh tenants on his estate, understanding their long history of peaceful coexistence. Flemings in Wales, seeking revenge on Glendower, attacked him but were defeated. The victory boosted support for Glendower, causing concern among the Lords of the Marches, who requested the king's intervention. The defeat of the Flemings led to increased security measures in Ludlow, anticipating further threats.

The Lords of the Marches were instructed to fortify their castles, anticipating a possible incursion by Glendower as the English army moved through the mountains. Despite promises and rewards, some English supporters defected, countered by the Welsh's increased fervor due to the English army's repeated failures. In October, Henry advanced with troops from twenty-two counties but faced harsh conditions and achieved little before retreating. Sir Edmund faced a dilemma in delivering a crucial letter to the king. Oswald volunteered to undertake the perilous task, tracing the king's route to deliver the message.

Sir James Burgon and Sir Philip Haverstone volunteered to carry the letter, willing to take the risk upon themselves instead of the esquire. They felt it would be a shame to remain idle while the esquire rode into possible danger. Although Sir Edmund's feelings aligned with them, he explained that sending two knights would violate the king's orders. Understanding this, they agreed that the esquire should undertake the task. Sir Edmund feared King Henry might find a pretext to harm him since he couldn't defend himself against the king's army. Oswald assured Sir Edmund he would deliver the letter to the king, explaining his loyalty to Sir Henry Percy and his willingness to follow the king's orders.

It is crucial to rely on luck and move discreetly to avoid danger. The governor offered to care for their horses until their return, or he would use them if they didn't come back before the king's return. The Welsh face a grim fate if they persist in their futile resistance against England. Oswald planned to leave at night to evade Welsh threats and had provisions for a three-day journey. The English attire would help them blend in as they traveled towards the king's camp. The Welsh, lacking discipline and resources, are no match for England's might. The Scots, on the other hand, pose a more significant challenge due to their strength and victories on level ground.

Staying close to the line of trees, they followed the valley past the ruins of Montgomery, bypassing Newtown without entering. Shouts echoed through the woods, prompting them to move cautiously as Welsh ambushes were nearby, ready to strike. By midday, they left the forest edge and climbed the hills to avoid potential enemies lurking at the forest's edge. Despite hearing voices nearby, they managed to cross side valleys unnoticed as the Welsh were not expecting anyone to traverse those paths. As night fell, they reached Llanidloes, where they encountered English soldiers in the streets. The soldiers questioned their origin and purpose, warning of the dangers ahead due to Glendower's scattered troops. The travelers, undeterred, shared their mission to deliver a crucial message to the king, prepared to navigate the treacherous terrain ahead.|"['1.

Roger and Oswald set up a fire in their shelter using dry materials. Roger had dry fungus and fir needles to ignite the flames. They enjoyed a meal of bread and meat by the warm fire, washing it down with wine. As the rain had seeped into their bags, they dried their provisions by the fire. The next morning, with the sky clearing, they decided to stay put for another day. They planned to climb a nearby hill for a better view.

"Looking back for a moment, after running about a mile, Oswald and Roger reached the top of a hill. Oswald noticed that five of their chasers had moved ahead of the others but were still the same distance away as when they started. The pursuers were still behind them, and after running another half-mile, the five men were only thirty yards back. Their comrades' shouts echoed through the forest, and occasionally, the men behind them joined in a loud cry. Oswald drew his sword, and Roger did the same, surprising the Welshmen. Roger struck one on the head, and Oswald hit another on the chin. They swiftly incapacitated the remaining two men. ""To the right!"" Oswald shouted, leading them into the forest at a different angle. They soon heard angry yells from where they had been. Oswald suggested they walk quietly to avoid running into more pursuers attracted by the noise. They waded through a shallow stream, careful not to leave tracks.

During a storm, we lost our way in the forest without a guide, and were delayed for nearly two days. When the weather cleared this morning, we found our path. Along the way, we encountered a group of about twenty Welshmen who chased us. We managed to outrun most of them, except for five. To avoid being surrounded, we fought and defeated them. Despite being pursued, we safely navigated through the forest until we emerged close by. The earl described the perilous adventure, mentioning the Welsh presence and the obstacles they had set up on the roads. A messenger named Oswald Forster, an esquire of Sir Henry Percy, bravely delivered a letter to the king, traveling on foot through the woods to reach him.

Roger complimented Sir Oswald on his appearance, remarking on his transformation from a bookish boy to a strong man. Sir Oswald, in turn, instructed Roger to stay and help him with his armor as he needed to return to Lord Talbot's tent. There, Sir Oswald was introduced to several knights and shared his experience of navigating through the Welsh territory. Due to bad weather, operations were halted, and the camp faced challenges due to swollen streams and slippery terrain. A convoy was organized to transport the sick back to Llanidloes, guarded by knights, mounted men, and archers. The departure was kept secret to avoid Welsh attacks.

Their progress was slow as the wagons often sank in the mud, needing men to push them out. A silence followed the woods' commotion. Oswald suggested tying picket ropes to wagons and horses to speed up. The convoy was halfway when attacked by men from the forest. Sir Eustace organized a defense with knights forming lines. Arrows flew, but the English archers pushed back the Welsh. Footmen joined the battle as the Welsh charged. The English fought bravely, mounted men dismounted to fight on foot.

Following Sir Eustace's commands, the English troops attempted to regroup during the battle. Oswald and Roger found themselves separated from the main group, facing overwhelming odds. Despite their strength and skill, they struggled to break through the enemy lines. As the battle raged on, Roger was wounded, but the Welsh leader, recognizing Oswald's bravery, offered assistance. The Welshmen bandaged Roger's wounds and provided aid. Eventually, they carried Roger on a makeshift litter through the forest to a farmhouse, where they rested.

Oswald was injured but fortunate that the arrow missed vital areas in his neck. The wound was tended to, and he was given water to quench his thirst.

Oswald, a brave and swift messenger, was knighted by the king for delivering a crucial message. Glendower, a powerful leader, admired Oswald's courage. Glendower held Oswald captive but treated him well, considering a ransom instead of harm. Oswald's kindness to Glendower's daughters was kept secret to prevent political issues. Glendower's mystical reputation intrigued Oswald, who noticed his influence over his followers. Glendower's supernatural aura, fueled by bards' tales, impressed both allies and enemies. Oswald pondered if Glendower truly believed in his powers or if it was a result of adulation and success. As Oswald stayed with Glendower, he witnessed the leader's courteous demeanor contrasting with brutal actions, hinting at a possible mental decline due to superstition and flattery.|"['1.

At the end of two weeks, Roger's wound, though not fully healed, allowed him to ride a horse. Oswald was eager to leave as Glendower offered a strong escort for their safety. Two horses from a previous battle were given to them. Oswald's armor was returned in excellent condition. Glendower gave Oswald rings to show as a sign of friendship in Wales. As they left with Glendower's followers, Oswald reminded Roger to keep their escape story secret. They planned to head straight to Northumberland to avoid suspicion. After two days, they reached Glendower's daughter's house. She recognized Oswald from a past encounter and thanked him for his kindness.

A week later, a formal ceremony took place at the castle. Oswald, in the presence of the earl, Hotspur, and other knights and gentlemen, swore allegiance to Sir Henry Percy and later to the king. He was granted two knight's feus, including the villages of Stoubes and Rochester in Reddesdale. Oswald chose these lands, just a twelve-mile ride from his father's place in Coquetdale. The oath of allegiance was a way to limit the power of great vassals, but in times of conflict, vassals often sided with their immediate lord. Oswald, now a knight, returned home to Yardhope to a warm welcome. His father advised him on managing his new lands and retainers. Oswald then rode into Reddesdale to meet his tenants, who were pleased to have a young knight as their lord. After three months, the castle repairs were completed, and Oswald was ready to begin his new role as lord of Stoubes.|"['1.

The Welsh, in their victory, displayed brutality. Meanwhile, Douglas led Scottish raids into Northumberland, retaliated by English forces. The Earl of Dunbar defeated the Scots at West Nesbit. Alnwick prepared for a Scottish invasion, anticipating a fierce battle. The Percy's men readied to defend Northumberland, while precautions were taken to safeguard valuables.

Father, I will do the same. Stoubes can withstand a normal attack but not one led by Douglas. I will move the valuables to Alnwick and hide the rest in the woods.

During the period between learning of Mortimer's capture and the battle at Homildon Hill, Percy communicated with the king about ransoming Mortimer, but the king responded coldly, hinting at a conspiracy between Mortimer and Glendower. Hotspur and others were outraged by this accusation. The knights were ready to draw their swords at the command of their lords, showing loyalty to their barons over the king. When the Percys reported their victory and the capture of important nobles, the king ordered that the prisoners not be ransomed, causing further anger. The nobles relied on ransom for revenue, and the king's order signified a political move to hold the prisoners as hostages.

They planned to join forces with Scotland and raise an army to restore the young Earl of March to power. Glendower, considering the proposal, saw the potential for gaining independence for Wales and securing peace and prosperity for the country.

Oswald informed Sir Edmund that the ransom was collected but the king, suspecting him of treachery, refused to release the funds raised by his tenants. Feeling betrayed, Sir Edmund decided to join Glendower against King Henry. Glendower welcomed him as a friend, offering him a safe haven until they were ready to act against the king. Sir Edmund accepted the offer and was assigned a house in Aberystwith. Meanwhile, Oswald returned to Alnwick with news of the successful alliance, and the Earl rewarded him with land and the title of a knight banneret.

Three days later, Hotspur released all his Scottish captives and had them escorted to the border. The Percys intensified their war preparations. Hotspur moved to Morpeth, while the earl headed to Berwick-on-Tweed to meet Scottish allies. Oswald traveled by ship to Wales, informing Glendower and Mortimer of the upcoming rebellion. Glendower was to raise an army, Mortimer to gather forces in Hereford. The king, sensing rebellion, readied his troops, appointing the Prince of Wales to lead.
