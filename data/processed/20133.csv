Bunny Brown was determined to find Wopsie's aunt, even though he wasn't sure how. Whenever he and Sue were out, they asked colored women if they knew Wopsie, but no one did. Bunny and Sue, used to the city, even thought of taking a taxicab alone. The chauffeur assumed their family would pay for the ride. In Central Park, they saw elephants and a hippopotamus. The children watched in amazement as one elephant played a mouth organ. Bunny and Sue enjoyed their time at the park, observing the different animals.

One day, they saw a man making griddle cakes in a restaurant window and ordered some with maple syrup. The waitress and others smiled at them. Bunny confidently ordered ice cream afterward.

Bunny and Sue found a stray dog on the street and decided to feed him. They couldn't keep the dog, but they gave him water and meat. Later, they went to a moving picture show with Wopsie.

Aunt Lu, Bunny, and Sue encountered a hungry man in need. Despite their good intentions, Aunt Lu advised them to seek permission before inviting strangers over. Later, the family visited an aquarium in Battery Park, New York City. Bunny and Sue were captivated by the variety of fish, seals, alligators, and turtles swimming in tanks and pools. Bunny even fashioned a makeshift fishing hook to try catching fish. While Mrs. Brown and Aunt Lu observed playful seals, Bunny attempted to fish in a pool. The seals entertained the crowd with their energetic antics, leaping and splashing water around. Bunny's fishing adventure added excitement to their aquarium visit.|"['1.

Bunny and Sue were so engrossed watching the monkeys and parrots in the store window that they completely forgot about their mother and Aunt Lu. The mischievous monkeys in the cage were playing tricks on each other, and the children found it amusing. Bunny even suggested they could save up to buy a monkey and a parrot for their dog, Splash. As they entered the animal store, they were fascinated by the variety of animals inside. Sue realized they couldn't have pets at Aunt Lu's house due to the strict elevator boy, Henry.

Mother Brown and Aunt Lu hurried to the police station. Inside, they approached a long desk with a brass rail, manned by a man in a soldier-like uniform.

Bunny and Sue were reassured by their Aunt Lu that if they ever got lost in New York, a policeman would help them find their way home.

A kind policeman found them and took them to the police station, where they waited until their aunt and mother arrived to pick them up. The next day, they visited Coney Island with their family, enjoying the sights and sounds of the amusement park.

Returning on the boat was pleasant. A band played music while Bunny and Sue, along with other kids, danced. They arrived home after dark, eager to sleep. Their mother and Aunt Lu made them repeat the house number and street name multiple times. The children had cards with the address but had left them at home when they visited the animal store. The excitement of New York differed from their country and Bellemere experiences. In the city, they could only play on Aunt Lu's street. Bunny and Sue asked strangers if they were missing a little girl, showing their freedom in speech. Despite the search, the little girl stayed with Aunt Lu, helping out. Bunny and Sue eventually flew kites from the roof, enjoying the breeze and safety. Bunny got a colorful kite, and they took turns flying it while Wopsie watched.|"['1.

Bunny Brown's kite soared high in the sky above Aunt Lu's house. The strong wind on the rooftop made it fly even higher, free from any obstacles like trees that could catch its tail. Bunny watched as the kite went up and up, the wind blowing harder than before. He held onto the string tightly, but suddenly, a strong gust of wind pulled the kite with great force. Despite Sue and Wopsie trying to hold on, the kite slipped away, rolling out of reach. Bunny chased after it on the roof, but the kite sailed off over the other rooftops. Bunny's mother warned that it would be challenging to chase the kite in the city with so many houses around. Undeterred, Bunny, Sue, and Wopsie set off on a quest to find the runaway kite, but the city's buildings obstructed their view.

Bunny and Sue, along with their friend Wopsie, strolled back to Aunt Lu's house. As they walked through an unfamiliar street, they noticed the shabby houses and poorly dressed people. They passed by a group of children pretending to have a party with makeshift treats. The older girl leading the play-party instructed the others on how to behave and share the imaginary food. Sue, inspired by the scene, invited the children to a real party at Aunt Lu's house the next day. The children on the stoop were thrilled by the invitation and promised to come.

After Sue's wonderful party, Bunny and Sue enjoyed playing around Aunt Lu's house during rainy days. As fall approached, the weather turned colder, hinting at the upcoming winter. One day, while riding a pony cart, a dog startled the pony, causing it to speed up. Bunny urged the pony to go faster, but the dog's barking made him nervous. The cart rattled over bumps, making Bunny speak cautiously to avoid biting his tongue. The dog continued to chase the cart, barking and growling. Despite the fast pace, Bunny knew Wopsie shouldn't jump out. The boy accompanying them struggled to keep up due to his short legs. Eventually, the pony slowed down as the dog gave up the chase, disappearing from sight.|"[""1.

Bunny and Sue were enjoying a ride in a pony cart when suddenly the pony started going faster downhill. Unable to control the pony, Sue suggested calling a policeman to help stop it.

"""We are so fortunate!"" exclaimed Wopsie, observing the boy driving the pony cart back. The pony was moving slowly. ""I suppose we'll walk back,"" continued the girl. ""It's not too far."" Following Aunt Sallie, who was quite plump, the children and Wopsie strolled across the lush, green lawn, still vibrant even though late in the autumn. Soon, the green grass would be blanketed with snow. ""We reside at Aunt Lu's house - we are visiting her,"" Bunny mentioned. ""We live quite a distance away and spent the summer at Grandpa Brown's farm. We will be staying here in New York for Christmas."" ""I truly believe I am, child!

Every day, Bunny and Sue, along with Wopsie or Sallie, visited Central Park. They often stopped by Aunt Sallie's candy stand, chatting with her and occasionally buying candy sticks. With the weather turning colder, ice cream was no longer an option. Some days were too chilly and windy for Bunny and Sue to venture out. The park no longer housed ponies and donkeys for rides due to the cold. Wopsie, or Sallie, continued to stay with Aunt Lu until it was confirmed she belonged there. Aunt Sallie, who ran the candy stand, was financially stable and capable of caring for herself and Sallie. Bunny suggested sliding on the flat roof, as there was plenty of snow. They enjoyed a unique sliding experience on the roof, a change from the usual ground sliding back home. The children eagerly awaited Christmas, spending their time exploring the rooftop when the weather allowed.|"[""1.
