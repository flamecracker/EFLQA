The tailor in Gloucester worked tirelessly all day, sewing and piecing together expensive fabrics for a coat and waistcoat for the Mayor. He meticulously cut the cloth, talking to himself as he measured and trimmed the silk. The table was scattered with cherry-colored snippets, ready to be sewn into a beautiful outfit. However, as night fell, the tailor realized he was short of one skein of cherry-colored silk. He sent his cat, Simpkin, out with the last of their money to buy provisions and the missing silk. Worried about the buttonholes and the looming deadline, the tailor lamented his reliance on Simpkin and the mischievous mice that roamed the house. As Simpkin returned, the mice fled, leaving the tailor to ponder his predicament in the cold winter evening.|"['1.
