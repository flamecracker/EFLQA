The group of children was thrilled to find the blackberry patch not far ahead. Refreshed from their lunch, they crossed a field and climbed a few fences to reach it. The thicket was dense with thorns and briars, surprising Marian with their sharpness. Recalling a story about Phebe, the Blackberry Girl, Marian felt a connection to her trials. As they picked berries, Marian's excitement led her to overlook the damage the briars were causing to her dress and skin. Stella, noticing Marian's distress, suggested a solution to hide the torn dress by matching it with her petticoat. They also decided to mix their blackberries and carry water from a nearby spring. Stella cleverly separated the berries to avoid any mixing.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did the group of children find that thrilled them?\nA) A field\nB) A fence\nC) A thicket\nD) A spring\nE) A blackberry patch', 'Question 2:\nWhy was Marian surprised by the thicket?\nA) It was too far away\nB) It was too small\nC) It was too dense with thorns and briars\nD) It was too open\nE) It was too bright', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Marian recall that made her feel a connection to her trials?\nA) A story about Stella\nB) A story about a field\nC) A story about a fence\nD) A story about Marian\nE) A story about Phebe, the Blackberry Girl', 'Question 4:\nWhy did Marian overlook the damage the briars were causing?\nA) She was tired\nB) She was sad\nC) She was excited\nD) She was angry\nE) She was lost', ""Question 5:\nWhat did Stella suggest to hide Marian's torn dress?\nA) Mixing the berries\nB) Carrying water\nC) Climbing fences\nD) Matching it with her petticoat\nE) Separating the berries"", 'Question 6:\nHow did Stella cleverly prevent the mixing of the blackberries?\nA) By carrying water\nB) By climbing fences\nC) By mixing the berries\nD) By separating the berries\nE) By hiding the torn dress']"|['E) A blackberry patch', 'C) It was too dense with thorns and briars', 'E) A story about Phebe, the Blackberry Girl', 'C) She was excited', 'D) Matching it with her petticoat', 'D) By separating the berries']

Marian was delighted with her new tiny doll, Patty. She cherished the little doll for being so cute and versatile, unlike her larger doll. Patty kept her company on the way home, filling a void left by Marian's lack of childhood companions. Marian's imaginative nature allowed her to entertain herself easily, even in solitude. She reflected on the joys life had brought her, like meeting new people and experiencing new things. Marian hoped her father would be like Patty, engaging and attentive. The prospect of her father's visit filled her with anticipation and longing. However, her excitement was dampened when she contracted whooping cough and had to stay home, missing school and her friends. Despite her disappointment, Marian found solace in her toy companions, Dippy and Tippy, as she navigated through her illness.|"['1.

Miss Dorothy explained to Marian that it can be difficult to choose between two equally good things. She promised to keep Marian updated on home news weekly, including updates on her friends and family. As Marian prepared to leave, her grandfather bid her farewell with a kiss and a nickel. Her grandmother wasn't around to ask for the nickel for the missionary box, so Marian kept it to buy a picture postcard to inform her father of her new address. Heppy, the housekeeper, quietly gave Marian a package of her delicious cakes as a parting gift. Marian realized that Heppy was kind despite her gruff exterior. Marian was impressed by the beautiful house near the college where her friend Patty lived.

At noon, the factory whistle blew, signaling lunchtime for the workers. As the crowd of men, women, boys, and girls headed towards the small houses, two children hid behind a rock.
