The best method for learning to read is through words rather than just letters or sounds. This is because words represent things and actions, making them more meaningful and interesting to students. It's also important to review words frequently to ensure quick and thorough progress. Reviews should include new words in different orders to test recognition skills. Spelling practice is crucial and should include new words from lessons for dictation and oral exercises. The script used for teaching should be clear, large, and accurate to aid in copying and reading. Lessons should introduce only a few new words at a time to ensure proper understanding and gradual learning. Illustrations in textbooks should be diverse, well-done, and created by renowned artists and engravers for visual appeal and engagement.|['1.
