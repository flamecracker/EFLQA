"Chapter I: Glen Mason's Escape

Despite the superintendent's efforts to reform the boys, Glen remains indifferent. Glen dreams of returning home triumphant and successful, rather than seeking forgiveness for his past mistakes.

When Glen really wanted something, he would go to great lengths to achieve it. He had his sights set on earning thirty days of good behavior marks, a goal that surprised the officers who were not used to seeing Glen follow the rules for so long. After reaching his goal, he asked for permission to go to town to see the dentist. The Superintendent, impressed by Glen's behavior, granted him the pass but also wanted to ensure Glen's trustworthiness. Glen was instructed to wear his uniform, take the streetcar to the dentist, and return by six o'clock.

Glen thought about the kind Gates family he had just left and contrasted them with Mr. Jervice, feeling betrayed by Jervice. Glen decided to return to school, feeling hungry and tired.

The Native Americans had been tracking the group of plainsmen for days, waiting for a chance to strike. They both feared and despised the plainsmen but had never risked an attack in the open prairie. Now, stealthy figures emerged from the shadows, taking cover behind trees with the intent to unleash their marksmanship. The old Pottawatomie storyteller warned of ghostly figures lurking between the trees at night, but assured the listeners that the danger had long passed.

The group gathered cheerfully at the table, with the scout leader assigning each scout a chance to serve as waiters. Despite most scouts embracing the task, Patrol Leader Matt Burton displayed disdain for the duty. Despite his reluctance, he managed to rise to the rank of Patrol Leader due to his natural leadership skills. As the scouts enjoyed their meal, Bob informed Matt of a special request from Mr. Spencer for fresh and soft eggs. Chick-chick humorously offered to sell Matt a new car while attending to the request. Glen observed the interactions and began to form opinions about the different scouts, favoring Apple Newton and Chick-chick. However, he harbored a strong dislike for Matt Burton, yearning for a chance to confront him physically.|"['1.

Glen had a feeling that there might be a clash with Matt if he stayed at camp for too long. Despite Matt's wrong actions, he managed to control his temper, leading to Glen's defeat. Glen, surrounded by other boys, should have been content, but he felt unhappy. The trust and reliance of Will Spencer meant more to him. Glen had never felt trusted like this before. Glen's responsibilities were now shared among the group, and he needed to engage with the boys to keep them interested in finding the springs. The day kept Glen busy, especially during the campfire where he was up for a tenderfoot initiation by the scout master, Mr. Newton, who believed in unique and captivating initiation ceremonies for special occasions.|"[""1.

This event was unique because only scouts attended the camp, so initiation rituals were unnecessary. It was also special as it took place outdoors due to the absence of an assembly tent. Mr. Newton welcomed the change as the day had been hot, a storm was approaching, and many scouts felt uneasy. After dinner, he instructed all scouts on tent duty to prepare for rain. As the storm neared, they gathered around the campfire for initiation. Using lanterns and torches, Mr. Newton preferred natural light. The night grew cooler, the campfire illuminated the area, casting shadows. Glen, the candidate, was joined by a larger scout who symbolically passed the camp flag to him. Other scouts reaffirmed their commitment to truth, loyalty, and service. The ceremony concluded with all scouts forming circles, reciting the Scout Law, and taking the Scout Oath despite the impending storm.|"['1. What made this camp event unique?\nA.

"Scout, you are now a tenderfoot in our scout ranks, a starting point for you to earn honor and merit. We are all brothers here. Even when storms threaten and the skies seem heavy, we offer you the warmth of scout fellowship and the embrace of scout camaraderie. Remember this oath as you face life's challenges. ""Dismiss troop!"" the scout master called out, and the orderly boys quickly scattered to their tents. Glen, now a Boy Scout of America, faced a rough start with his patrol leader, Matt Burton. Despite feeling humiliated with his camp cleaning duty, Glen's leadership qualities emerged during a treasure hunt with his friend Apple.

Mr. Newton instructed the scout master to lead the way as they followed Matt to his exploration site in search of treasure. Although the box they found was not very big, there could be more hidden. Matt reluctantly accepted help from Glen and Apple to uncover the heavy box. Excitement grew as they unearthed the mysterious box. When Chick-chick confessed to playing a prank by burying the box, it was seen as a harmless joke. The scout master had private talks with the boys involved to address the situation.

""Well, listen up. I knew you'd be the right person. Who can I find that's strong but not too big, I thought. Then it hit me - you, the reform school boy. 'He's the one,' I thought. Probably done this kind of thing before.""

Unbeknownst to Glen and Jervice, Matt was not only capable but was actually nearby, just above them in a tree. He observed them silently, feeling superior to both.

Imagine being dropped through a window and landing on the floor. Your task is to reach the front and unbolt the door. The lock is manageable, but there are old-fashioned bolts inside. Take a moment to figure out how to cross the room without knocking things over. Study the fastenings on the front door. Glen looked at the man holding him, noticing a hard, rough, cruel, and ugly expression. The man suggested joining them for safety, tempting Glen. He almost gave in, fearing the consequences of resistance. However, memories of Matt's situation made him hesitate. The man decided to send Glen to the city, ensuring his return by night.

"Henry, also known as Chick-chick, wasn't interested in excelling in sports like his friend Matt. Instead, he was fascinated by insects like beetles, bugs, butterflies, and bees. He had a dream of finding a ""bee tree"" and believed he saw signs of one near the blazed oak. Matt, impressed by Henry's determination, decided to help him discover the tree. He cleverly set up a fake bee tree with honeycomb and borrowed bees to attract more bees. As they returned from swimming, Henry chased a butterfly towards the tree, where they found the honeycomb. Although it wasn't a real bee tree, the discovery brought excitement and curiosity among the campers. Henry's passion for nature and insects led to an unexpected adventure, showing that sometimes the most exciting discoveries come from unexpected places."|"[""1.

Mr. Newton addressed the scouts, cautioning them against making assumptions about Glen Mason and the peddler. He emphasized the troop's responsibility towards Glen's safety. Concerned that the peddler might have ulterior motives, Mr. Newton instructed the scouts to split into groups and search the designated areas. He warned them not to attempt a rescue without him. Following tire tracks, they discovered a recent campsite and footprints. The scouts decided to return to headquarters to report their findings.

Hiding in the bushes, the scouts watched as Mr. Jervice interacted with someone in a car. Their hearts raced with excitement, but they couldn't hear the conversation. Suddenly, they saw Mr. Jervice's sinister grin. Anxiously, they observed him closing the van doors without locking them, a grave mistake. When Mr. Jervice left, the scouts rushed to the car and found their comrade tied up. With quick thinking, they freed him. As they planned their next move, they heard footsteps approaching. Mr. Jervice, sensing danger, swiftly secured the car and drove off. Despite the change in circumstances, the scouts remained determined to outwit Mr. Jervice. Glen, now free, appreciated the freedom and fresh air. Chick-chick suggested using the car to catch Mr. Jervice.

""If we're lucky enough to reach Buffalo Center, we should hand it over to the first officer we see to avoid getting in trouble for stealing,"" advised Glen cautiously. As they continued their journey, they noticed their pursuers catching up to them. It was time to act. Approaching a hill, they were spotted by the pursuers who fired a shot but missed. Reaching a creek at the foot of the hill, they carefully descended, leaving little trace. Glen covered their tracks and Chick-chick skillfully drove the car under a bridge for concealment.

But Glen warned them that tattoos were not a sign of strength but often a mark of bad choices. He shared the advice of a wise man who said that real strength comes from within, not from tattoos.

Matt was told about a cave by an Indian, but it's not near Buffalo Creek. The cave is down near Vinegar Creek. Matt was superstitious and afraid of dead men, so he didn't want to look for the treasure. The Indian offered to show Matt the exact spot for five dollars. Matt wanted to find the treasure to prove a point and catch bank robbers. However, Matt found a better plan. He met engineers camping nearby who were surveying the area.

The sheriff identified a man named Black Coventry as part of a gang and suspected two others were nearby. The sheriff warned his deputy to be vigilant.

Glen discovered the solution he sought, though the man he sought was not in sight. A lengthy rope twirled through the air, landing neatly over the three closely bound heads. It swiftly tightened as it descended past their shoulders. The tied trio struggled frantically, and suddenly the deputy appeared, securing his rope to a tree. Glen averted his gaze upon hearing voices behind him, signaling the return of the sheriff's group. Waving for them to hasten, he was relieved to see the sheriff, Mr. Newton, and Chick-chick approaching quickly. The group escorted the captured prisoners back to town in a triumphant procession. Glen offered Matt a ride on his motorcycle, but Matt chose to ride the sheriff's horse, feeling his involvement had been laughable. Glen valued Matt's company and cycling expertise, eager to repay his kindness and learn from him on the journey back to camp.|"['1.

Glen Mason had recently found immense joy and satisfaction in the company of his friends, Apple and Chick-chick. As they trekked up Buffalo Mound together, carrying firewood and blankets for their camp, a newfound bond of fellowship formed between them. This connection, though difficult to express in words, was deep and authentic. The time spent together around the campfire held special significance for Glen, marking the beginning of his spiritual journey and his commitment to serving others. The peaceful moments under the starry sky brought him a sense of tranquility like never before. The next morning, Glen and Apple awoke early to witness the breathtaking view from Buffalo Mound, using a field glass to observe the distant towns and a mysterious Indian by Buffalo Creek. Excited by their discovery, they embarked on a secret adventure to explore a hidden cave known as the Ice Box.|"['1.

Once they entered the narrow passage, they found themselves in a cave. Light barely seeped in from the small opening, but the darkness above and behind them was impenetrable. A dense mass of something loomed ahead, which Apple, boldly swimming forward, identified as a pile of stones. Glen agreed they could keep this discovery to themselves for a while. They had stashed lanterns, a pick, and spades nearby, which they retrieved to explore further. The cave's floor was partially submerged in water flowing swiftly towards a counter opening. The cave was longer than they thought, with hidden openings further back. The most striking feature was a solid arch of masonry. They tried to move some big stones but realized it would be a lot of work. Apple imagined a procession of people carrying loads of stone, while Glen suggested they might have obtained the rocks from high ledges in the cave.|"['1.

The two boys worked hard together, breaking up the task with determination. They wanted to find the treasure and share the news with their friends. Matt approached cautiously, but the boys remained silent, showing self-control. Apple, feeling Matt was unfair to Glen, tried to lighten the mood with a cheerful greeting despite the rain outside. With four pairs of hands, the work progressed faster. Matt, eager to prove himself, worked diligently. Suddenly, they noticed the water rising. Glen bravely jumped into the water and retrieved something heavy. The boys quickly helped lift the injured boy to safety.

Apple was able to stop the persistent flow of blood from Matt's wound by applying pressure with his fingers, despite not having any bandage material. As Matt drifted in and out of consciousness, Glen decided to swim along the side to find an opening to reach safety. Despite the challenges, Glen remained determined to locate the opening and bring help. Apple advised Matt to rest and avoid moving too much to prevent the wound from reopening. The group decided to conserve their resources and use light only when necessary. Glen remained optimistic about finding the opening and returning with a rope to rescue his friends.

"""Easy, Matt. Acting out won't help us, and hitting your head won't either. Look at Brick, he's exhausted from working in the water. You can't do better than him,"" said Chick-chick. ""You need to act like a man and a Christian. You're bleeding again; lie down."" They slept for hours without knowing the time. Glen finally lit a lantern in the early morning. Leading them to a tunnel-like opening, he pointed into the darkness. The boys followed, the water rushing past them. Glen warned of the risk ahead, suggesting they go one at a time.

"It was a fast-paced race as they hurried through the tunnel, with Glen leading the way. Suddenly, he turned a corner and shouted with joy as they saw daylight ahead. ""It's Buffalo Hollow!"" he exclaimed. ""We've made it through the Mound. The opening is too small for us to pass, but the water is flowing out, creating Buffalo Lake."" As the sun began to rise, they felt the freedom of being outside, taking in the beauty of nature. Apple quickly ran towards camp to reassure his father.

"On a Monday morning, the entire camp gathered at the Ice Box. The stream was still high, making it challenging to reach the cave. However, all scouts who had passed the swimming test for ""first class"" were determined to try. Led by Mr. Newton, with Glen and Apple close behind, they entered the cave. Disappointingly, they found farm products, old items, and tools but no exciting treasure. Matt Burton, unable to join due to a wound, believed their luck would have been different with an extra member. After moving a loose rock, they discovered a hidden vault filled with valuable items. Mr. Newton instructed them to transport the findings to camp, setting aside discussions on ownership for later.
