"""Rubbish! We're not done for yet,"" declared the man, gesturing towards the winding branches of a plant climbing the cliff face. A shout from above spurred them on as their pursuers reached the plateau but missed their path down. Ebony led the way, agile as a monkey, followed by Breezy and then Hockins. The plant held their weight, sparing them a deadly fall. Hidden in a crevice, they listened as their pursuers approached. Relief washed over them, knowing they had eluded danger. The pursuers, dark-skinned and almost naked, narrowly avoided a fall themselves. Mistaking the situation, they believed the fugitives had tumbled down the cliff. James Ginger risked a peek and stifled a laugh at their enemies' folly. ""Those fools think we've fallen!"" chuckled Hockins. Now safe, the challenge was descending the cliff once their pursuers left."|"['1. What did the man gesture towards when he declared, ""Rubbish!

Mark Breezy and his companions found themselves lost in a dense forest, trying to escape their pursuers. As they navigated the rugged terrain, they stumbled upon a small river with a makeshift bridge. The sailor, Hockins, crossed first successfully, but when Mark attempted to follow, a mishap occurred. A powder-flask meant for safety fell into the river, rendering their gun useless. Despite their hunger and uncertainty about the land they were in, they pressed on, seeking shelter in the forest to evade the savages. As night fell, they perched in a tree, wary of dangers below. Little did they know that their journey, starting on a voyage to China, would lead them to unexpected adventures in Madagascar, testing their resilience and courage in the face of adversity.|"['1.

The battle was brief, and the trio hesitated to rush to the rescue when a cannon shot from the _Eastern Star_ struck down many natives. Uncertainty gripped Mark Breezy and his friends as they spotted a group of natives sneaking towards them. With thirty to forty foes closing in, their resolve was tested. A surge of determination flooded Mark as they fled, narrowly evading the pursuing savages. A deep ravine and a rocky ridge shielded their escape into the woods. The chase led them to a perilous cliff path, defying danger for survival. The attack stemmed from past cruelties by other white men, sparking unwarranted hostility. As dawn broke, they strategized to reach a distant mountain range, seeking refuge from their relentless pursuers. Their journey was fraught with peril, but hope flickered as they pressed on, discussing their next moves in the unforgiving wilderness.|"['1.

Hockins agreed to take sailing orders from the captain and steer towards Anty, hoping to arrive safely. Ebony, although hungry, found the forest gorgeous but lacking in food. As they traveled through the dense woods, they discovered a narrow path that led them through the tropical beauty of the forest. Mark suggested resting due to the tropical heat, and the group climbed a tree to sleep safely. Upon waking, they emerged from the woods to find a grassy plain where a herd of wild cattle grazed. Mark, with limited ammunition, decided to approach the cattle cautiously to secure food for the hungry group.|['Question 1:\nWhat did Hockins agree to do for the captain?\nA) Cook a meal\nB) Mend the sails\nC) Take sailing orders\nD) Navigate through the forest\nE) Hunt for wild cattle', 'Question 2:\nHow did Ebony feel about the forest?\nA) Scary\nB) Ugly\nC) Gorgeous\nD) Crowded\nE) Deserted', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Mark suggest the group do due to the tropical heat?\nA) Swim in the river\nB) Build a shelter\nC) Climb a tree to sleep\nD) Hunt for food\nE) Continue walking', 'Question 4:\nWhere did the group emerge after waking up from sleeping in the tree?\nA) Desert\nB) Beach\nC) Grassy plain\nD) Mountain\nE) Cave', 'Question 5:\nWhy did Mark decide to approach the wild cattle cautiously?\nA) To pet them\nB) To take pictures\nC) To secure food\nD) To ride them\nE) To play with them', 'Question 6:\nWhat did the group hope to find by approaching the herd of wild cattle?\nA) Shelter\nB) Water\nC) Food\nD) Firewood\nE) Directions']|['C) Take sailing orders', 'C) Gorgeous', 'C) Climb a tree to sleep', 'C) Grassy plain', 'C) To secure food', 'C) Food']
Approaching the animal within thirty yards was easy for the group, hidden by bushes. Mark readied his gun while Hockins drew his cutlass. Swiftly, Mark closed the distance to ten yards before the bull fled, and both barrels hit the flank. Enraged, the bull retreated, but then turned to charge Hockins. Despite his comrades' doubts, Hockins stood firm, inspired by his past at a South American bullfight. He faced the charging bull like a matador, stepping aside as it rushed past, but he couldn't resist plunging the cutlass deeper. The bull fell, mortally wounded. Mark suggested lighting a fire to cook the meat, and Ebony explained how to twist the bull's carcass to drain the blood. As they prepared the fire, Hockins checked for injuries after being tossed by the bull.|"['1. What did Mark use to attack the bull?\nA) A cutlass\nB) A gun\nC) A spear\nD) A bow\nE) A slingshot', '2.

The sailor explained that he was making new shoes to replace his worn-out ones. He mentioned that the design was similar to the first shoes made by Adam for Eve. To make the shoes, he used a piece of bull's hide, cut it to shape, and laced it up with rawhide, creating a simple yet effective shoe. After completing the shoes, he helped prepare dried meat for the journey. The group then rested under a tree, feeling refreshed and ready for the challenges ahead. They found themselves in a beautiful landscape, with open grassy plains and a stream teeming with wildlife. Ebony pondered on the purpose of such vast and untouched lands, suggesting that animals might appreciate and utilize the environment. Hockins and the Doctor discussed the potential future development of these lands, drawing parallels to the expansion of civilization in other parts of the world.|"[""1.

The hushed chatter stopped abruptly as a loud cry of shock and alarm echoed through the group. They had reached the base of the cliff and stumbled upon what seemed to be the lifeless body of their wounded companion. Some knelt by the injured man, examining him closely, while others expressed sorrow through gestures and words. A shawl had concealed the man's wound, and when they uncovered it, revealing a neatly bandaged limb, they exchanged surprised glances. Instead of tracking footprints, they fashioned a litter and carried the unconscious man away. As night fell, they found solace in a secluded cave, where they lit a fire and prepared a meal. Amidst the flickering flames, a sailor produced a small flute, enchanting his comrades with its melodious tunes. Unbeknownst to them, a mysterious figure outside the cave listened in secret, deeply moved by the music.|"['1.

"When Hockins finished playing his melody, the three friends were amazed and a bit scared to see a man calmly enter the cave, place his gun aside, and sit down across the fire. ""Well now, stranger,"" said Hockins, stowing away his instrument, ""how can we be sure you're a friend, except by your appearance, which seems honest, and your peaceful actions?"" The stranger replied, ""I've followed you step by step from the coast, aware of your encounters and dangers. I offer to guide you through the brigand-infested forest to safety."" Mark, skeptical, said, ""Seems we have no choice but to trust you."" The outlaw, rising, said, ""I won't reveal all, but I wish to help you."" Mark extended his hand, accepting the offer.

Hockins, talking to his friends while Ravonino was away, emphasized that they should focus on how Ravonino treats them, not his past actions. The group followed their guide through dense forest, enjoying the adventure despite the slow progress. Ravonino shared his thoughts on the queen, Ranavalona, and led them through a challenging path until they reached a cliff. Hockins, with his seaman skills, managed a tricky moment. As they looked down, they saw armed men below. Ravonino then guided them into a dark cave, where they encountered a door and voices on the other side.

The guide introduced his sister, Ra-Ruth, to his new friends in the vast hall of the cave where they sought refuge from the tyrant queen. The inhabitants, a mix of different tribes native to the island, displayed a variety of features and complexions. The central hall, brightly lit with torches, had no visible roof. The groups within the cave were marked by logs and goods, indicating living and sleeping spaces. Ravonino, the guide, led his sister to a meeting spot where news was shared among the group. Ra-Ruth, a timid but pretty young woman, clung to her brother while a dark, classically beautiful woman spoke with grace and dignity. A young man, likely the woman's brother, followed, exuding gentle modesty. The hymn was interrupted by a man rushing in with urgent news from a dark passage nearby.|['1.

In a dark cave, silence enveloped the three visitors, making them question reality. Suddenly, Ravonino's voice broke the stillness. As the silence returned, distant voices were heard, followed by a soldier carrying a torch. The soldier, brave yet superstitious, cautiously entered an outer cavern. A crowd of comrades, equally nervous, trailed behind. When a bolder soldier suggested another cave, a moment of despair loomed. But then, Hockins had an idea. He played a sweet melody on his flageolet, captivating the soldiers with awe. The soldiers, spellbound, retreated in silence, leaving the visitors relieved. Ravonino explained that the deliverance was not a miracle but a natural occurrence, bringing joy to all as they sang praises.|"['1.

"Ravonino, their guide, spoke urgently after their meal. ""Our current hideout is no longer safe,"" he said. ""We must relocate without delay. Pack up your belongings. At dawn, I will lead you to a new refuge. The soldiers may not return, but others will come searching."" The people swiftly gathered their things, leaving the guide and visitors to converse. During supper, Mark, Ravonino, Ebony, and John were unusually quiet. John voiced his concerns about the secrecy surrounding their situation, prompting Ravonino to acknowledge their suspicions.

The guide's eyes sparkled briefly as he recounted the hardships his family endured. He spoke of his mother, a noble lady in the court of King Radama the First, who supported missionaries. Despite being sold into slavery, they were taught the love of God and how to read by persevering teachers. Their land flourished with peace and joy until the king's death. Ranavalona, a ruthless woman, seized the throne through bloodshed, killing rightful heirs and loyal nobles. She persecuted Christians for over 25 years but spared her son, Prince Rakota, who sympathized with the Christians. Despite her cruelty, she showed a softer side to her son.|"[""1.

Ravonino, the guide, shared troubling news with the group. He revealed that the Queen of Antananarivo was furious with Christians, imprisoning many and sending troops to hunt down escapees. Hockins suggested a simpler plan to reach Antananarivo, but Ravonino explained the challenges of crossing Madagascar's vast and dangerous terrain without a guide. Ravonino's initial plan was to guide them partway, but now, driven by concern for his endangered friend, he hinted at needing their help to warn her. Mark, sensing Ravonino's feelings for his friend, offered his support and understanding.

The guide acknowledged the danger surrounding Rafaravavy, emphasizing the risks involved in helping. Despite this, he assured that their new hiding place was en route and the Queen's threat would subside for a while. The group gathered in a cave where a worn Bible in Malagasy was read, a prayer was said, and a hymn sung before resting. At dawn, they left the cave led by Ravonino to find a safer dwelling in the wilderness. Their journey was marked by persecution, akin to Christians of old. Reni-Mamba, a modest and kind woman, found solace in Christianity, feeling uplifted by the message of love and forgiveness.

In a brief explanation, Ravonino shared the adventurers' history with the chief, who welcomed them warmly upon learning they were friends of his friend. The chief then led them to the river where cattle were gathered, guarded by warriors. Voalavo, the chief, mentioned the abundance of crocodiles in Madagascar and narrated an incident where a trader ignored local advice and lost cattle to crocodiles. The trader then witnessed a protective ritual, where loud noises scared the crocodiles away, allowing the remaining cattle to cross safely.

Voalavo, a man known for his carefree attitude, displayed an unexpected superstition. Before commanding his cattle to cross the river, he approached the water's edge and whispered prayers for nearly thirty minutes. Then, speaking loudly to the crocodiles, he pleaded for them to spare his animals, emphasizing the effort it took to acquire them. He warned the crocodiles that if they harmed his cattle, he and his people would declare war. The herds were then guided across the river safely, mimicking a scene described by Ravonino. The consumption of food not only satisfies hunger but also stimulates the brain, fostering creativity and imagination. The party enjoyed a feast of rice, beef, chicken, and marrow-bones, followed by music on a flageolet.

Since then, we became like brothers. Laihova, who wasn't Christian then, later needed my help, and I was there for him. Now, we find ourselves in a village where the chief is showing us great hospitality. It's important not to appear ungrateful, as the Malagasy people take pride in their hospitality.

"In the past, some islanders used to smoke _rongona_, a potent stimulant made from hemp. Warriors would use it before battle as it made them nearly insane, preparing them for combat.

Hockins warned the hunters to be cautious to avoid startling the game. Laihova informed them that preparations were underway to approach the cattle from downwind, through the woods.

The spear narrowly missed the animal, grazing its back, and embedding itself in the ground. The hunter, John Hockins, was unexpectedly tackled by a negro while attempting a Red Indian approach. As he cautiously advanced with his spear, a tall figure suddenly appeared before him, causing his heart to race. Unsure of the creature's identity, he hesitated.

As Laihova led his friends towards Antananarivo, they mingled with the crowds heading to the city. People were bustling with goods for sale or purchases, meeting friends or family. To avoid drawing attention, they stayed among the throng until reaching the market. Laihova skillfully deflected any suspicions by explaining their arrival in Madagascar. The group observed the Hova army exercising below the city, impressively drilled in British military fashion by non-commissioned officers from Mauritius. This modernisation was initiated by the wise King Radama the First, who had a fondness for the English and used their military structure and commands.

Rainiharo, upon returning to his quarters, discovered that his nephew, Soa, had also embraced Christianity like Prince Ramonja. Rainiharo suspected that a troublemaker named Ravoninohitriniony was hiding nearby and influencing people in the palace to meet him secretly. To unravel this mystery, Rainiharo sent his nephew to spy on the meeting disguised as a Christian. Meanwhile, Mark Breezy and his friends bribed their way through the gate with silver coins, a common practice in Madagascar where coins were clipped into smaller pieces for transactions. The market scene was lively, with locals haggling over prices and engaging in spirited debates. Ebony, one of the travelers, immersed himself in the market atmosphere, showing a keen interest in the interactions and negotiations, embodying the spirit of the Malagasy people.|['1.

The market was like a museum and a hub of trade combined, showcasing diverse faces from various tribes across the island. It was a place to discover local products and crafts. There were piles of red clay earthenware, straw hats, and finely crafted ironwork. Beds made of mahogany-like wood with down-stuffed mattresses were on display. Colorful lambas, from coarse to ornate, were available. The market also offered wood for house structures, a variety of fruits and vegetables, and native rum. A musician strummed a guitar amid the bustling noise of fowls and turkeys. The scene changed when they stumbled upon a slave-market, where political prisoners and religious converts were sold into slavery. Moved by the injustice, Laihova guided his companions away, explaining the origins of slavery in their land. A chase unfolded before them, with a man fleeing for his life, pursued by a hostile crowd. Hockins, driven by his sense of justice, rushed to help the fugitive, followed by his friends and Laihova.|['1.

Hockins charged at a group of boys with a lion-like roar, knocking them down effortlessly. Ebony joined in, yelling and chasing others away. Meanwhile, Mark tended to an injured man who turned out to be their friend Mamba, the crocodile. Mamba explained he had been falsely accused of theft, leading to his injuries. With most wounds being bruises, they hurriedly took Mamba to a safe house. Suddenly, Mamba jumped up and escaped through a small window, followed by Laihova.

Addressing the homeowner, the Truth Seeker asked questions in the local language, bewildering the travelers. The armed men's hostile glares added to their unease. The homeowner's responses seemed unsatisfactory, prompting the Truth Seeker to command his men. They swiftly captured Mark and his friends. Initially shocked, Hockins and Ebony then readied themselves for a struggle until Mark intervened just in time. The men were bound, led through the streets by guards, and saved from the angry crowd. They were imprisoned, chained, and left to contemplate their situation. As the sun set and nature thrived, Soa, the prime minister's nephew, and his guide made their way towards the cavern where persecuted Christians gathered. The night's darkness suited their secretive mission. Approaching the cave, they encountered a solemn hymn and joined the congregation inside.|"[""1.

After the sermon ended, worshippers sang a hymn, prayed, and then gathered in groups, expressing surprise, joy, and gratitude when former enemies found unity as brothers in faith. Persecution in Madagascar from 1836 to 1861 aimed to eradicate Christianity but instead strengthened it. Despite severe laws and punishments, secret worship continued in caves, forests, and hidden places. Scriptures were shared cautiously, and baptism and communion were observed. Though persecution wavered, bursts of violence kept believers on edge. The Queen's spies posed a threat, but loyal friends like Soa offered help. Challenges loomed, especially concerning the safety of those dear to the community, but hope persisted as faith endured and the Church in Madagascar grew stronger.|"['1.

In a dark prison, Mark, John, and James woke to the sound of their chains rattling. Despite their grim situation, John remarked on the irony of hearing their own chains. James, known as Ebony, shared John's sentiments, examining his heavy iron chains with a rueful expression. The prisoners, disheartened by their plight, sat in silence until a heavenly song broke the stillness. The music, sung by two Christian captives in a dark corner, lifted the spirits of the three comrades. As the sun's light crept into the cell, it revealed the two men bound together by thick iron rings around their necks.

John Hockins, speaking softly, expressed his shock at the sight of prisoners burdened with heavy weights on their necks, yet finding solace in prayer. A jailor then entered, serving boiled rice to the prisoners and the travelers. The seaman, consumed by hunger, ate without pause. Witnessing the prisoners bless their meal, Hockins felt a pang of guilt. As they finished, the jailor swiftly removed the dishes. Ebony, hastily grabbing the last spoonful, threw it at the jailor, earning a caution from Mark. The seaman sought advice on their fate, fearing repercussions for interfering with justice. Mark, recalling their precarious situation, warned of potential banishment due to their Christian faith. The group discussed their predicament until two newcomers arrived, one of whom Mark recognized from a previous encounter on the island.

A sudden commotion outside the jail disrupted them as a crowd neared. Soon, they stopped at the door, which swung open, and four prisoners were pushed in, followed by guards and angry shouts. The door was shut on the yelling crowd, and the guards chained the prisoners. Three were quickly secured to the wall, but the fourth was restrained in a painful position. Witnessing this horror shocked Mark and his friends. Hockins, in a burst of rage, attempted to intervene but was restrained. Mark, Ebony, and the Interpreter firmly refused to accept the torture. The Interpreter, impressed by their courage, intervened to ease the prisoner's suffering. Mark thanked him and decided to follow their journey, leaving Hockins and Ebony behind. Meanwhile, Laihova and Mamba, after a daring escape, found themselves in a cluttered workshop courtyard, unharmed. Laihova decided to leave to seek help, while Ravoninohitriniony and friends would pray for the Englishmen's safety.|['1.

Mamba, a man seeking refuge, concealed himself until nightfall in an outhouse. He then ventured to a friend's house, seeking shelter. The city's houses lack ceilings, with open spaces up to the roof, occasionally featuring an upper chamber accessible by a ladder. The absence of chimneys causes smoke from fires to accumulate, forming soot that hangs down inside the houses. This soot is seen as a mark of a family's long occupation and is even esteemed as a sign of heritage. Mamba needed rest, food, clothing, and money after a harrowing experience. The next day, he stayed hidden until dusk, guided by his host to avoid detection. Wood-cutting is a significant industry in Madagascar, with forests providing various timber types. The wood-cutter Mamba encountered belonged to a government timber-felling group. He shared a message for a missionary, seeking aid in a time of need.|"[""1.

"Seated, he carefully placed them on his lap. Mamba quickly identified them as two pages from a Malagasy Bible. Despite being soiled, worn, and slightly torn from frequent use, they were still legible. One leaf contained the twenty-third Psalm, which the elderly wood-cutter read with great interest. ""Isn't it wonderful,"" he exclaimed to his young visitor, his weathered face glowing with joy, ""to think that after all this hard work, we will live in the Lord's house forever? No more toil, just praise and service for Him."" Mamba, intrigued, asked what he could do. The old man, lost in memories, shared how he once had a complete Bible during better times. He had received these two leaves after his Bible was burned by the ruling queen. He then revealed his deep desire for a new Bible, which he had asked a missionary for but couldn't obtain.

The next day, Mamba hurried eastward with hope in his heart, eager to reach Tamatave quickly to meet the missionary before he left the island. Despite the interesting sights along the way, he stayed focused on his goal. The journey was nearly 200 miles, with dangers like the Queen's spies. Mamba avoided drawing attention to himself due to his wounds. He encountered chained criminals and government officers whom he suspected were spies. To avoid suspicion, he engaged the boatman in conversation, diverting attention from himself.

When Mamba arrived, it was dark and late, but he couldn't wait until morning to seek a Bible. He had traveled far from the Betsilio country to meet the missionary who brought the Bible in their language. Mr. Ellis, cautious of Mamba's request, asked for his name and someone in Tamatave who knew him. Mamba revealed that they only had a few pages of the Book of Psalms passed around in his family and showed the worn leaves. Mr. Ellis offered Mamba the complete scripture, including the words of Jesus, John, Paul, and Peter. After verifying the content, Mamba joyfully accepted the new Bible for his praying mother.

We now find our friends Mark Breezy, John Hockins, and James Ginger leaving their prison after helping a suffering person and receiving mercy. The Interpreter guided them to a courtyard with small houses near the Queen's palace. They entered one house, and Mark tested the door, finding it open. Walking outside, they noticed the locals showing respect instead of curiosity. Hockins remembered they were told to wait for food, feeling hungry after a meager breakfast. Returning to the house, they found a feast being prepared. The aroma of rice, chicken, beef, vegetables, and fruits excited them. Despite their recent ordeal, they enjoyed the meal. Mark speculated that their good treatment might be due to their favor with a powerful officer.

"""I learned it from the missionaries when I was a little boy,"" he explained to Mark, as he guided the visitors through the entrance and into the palace courtyard. On the second floor veranda, the Queen sat beneath a scarlet umbrella with her Court gathered around her. Before entering, the visitors respectfully removed their hats and were instructed to bow deeply as they passed by. A line of native troops stood across the courtyard, wearing simple clothing and armed with old muskets and bayonets. Led by an Under-Secretary of State, the visitors ascended a narrow stairway to the balcony where the Queen was seated. She appeared regal in a satin gown and jewels, surrounded by her courtiers dressed in a mix of English and native attire.

The Queen appointed the young Maker of Medicine as the Court physician and his black companion as his servant. Mark Breezy and his friends were surprised but acknowledged the appointment respectfully. However, Mark humbly declined, explaining he was not yet qualified to practice. The Queen, Ranavalona, disregarded English customs and insisted Mark accept the position or face banishment. She then requested the English companion to play his unique instrument, the flageolet. Enthralled by the music, the Queen and her courtiers enjoyed the sailor's melodious performance. As they entered the house, the Prince informed Mark that their arrival had been anticipated by spies. The Queen had arranged a garden party at her suburban retreat, Anosy, and the group was escorted there in palanquins. Ebony, the black companion, humorously remarked about his cooking skills.

For two weeks following this, the palace and Court seemed to be in mourning, with no music or entertainment. A sense of impending disaster loomed over everyone. During this period, efforts were made to undo the work of missionaries and their followers in the country. Eventually, a massive gathering, called a Kabary, was summoned by the Queen in the capital. People knew this meant serious business. Soldiers herded the populace to the assembly near the palace. Thousands were gathered. Troops were stationed, cannons fired, and officials were present in their finest attire. The Queen's message, delivered by a high-ranking officer, emphasized her authority and the preservation of customs. She demanded the surrender of all new religious texts, confession of offenses, and obedience to her decrees under threat of death.

Boldness can lead to success where timidity might fail. Mamba, without hesitation, went straight to the palace to request to see the Maker of Medicine. Despite his imperfect English, he managed to show his hidden Testament to Mark Breezy, Hockins, and Ebony. Just as they were conversing, Hater-of-lies arrived with his guards and took Mamba away. The Christians on the island had many copies of Scriptures, but some were destroyed during the persecution.

The dreadful fate was swift in its arrival. She was led out of prison, towards the southern end of the hill where the city stood, known for the fatal precipice where many had met their end.

In the past, Madagascar had various ways to determine guilt, like swallowing poison or enduring a red-hot iron on the tongue. Among these, the Tangena ordeal was the most common. The Tangena nut, if taken in small amounts, makes one vomit, but in large doses, it can be fatal. Before ingesting the poison, the accused had to swallow fowl skin pieces. If the skin pieces were later found after vomiting, the person was considered innocent. If not, they were deemed guilty.

The Secretary was talkative and enjoyed showing off his English. He engaged in conversation with the young doctor, sharing intriguing details about the customs and laws of the Malagasy people. Among the laws, he mentioned a peculiar fact about criminals that sparked an idea in Mark's mind. The Queen's anger towards Christians made her ill, and Mark, the Court Physician, prescribed exercise, fresh air, and fun to distract her. Mark's care improved the Queen's health and mood, leading to a fondness for him. Mark's kindness and humility earned him respect and friendship in the palace. He organized garden parties and games to keep the Queen entertained and prevent further bloodshed.

It was decided that the palanquin should stop to avoid detection, and Ravonino, Rafaravavy, and Sarah would continue on foot through the dense forest. The first night went smoothly under the clear moonlight. However, the next evening, they encountered soldiers. To hide, they crouched behind rocks but had to run. Desperation led them to a pool of water with rushes. They submerged themselves, narrowly escaping notice. The soldiers chatted about capturing Rafaravavy. Wet and muddy, they faced the night in the open forest. Rafaravavy's faith and prayer uplifted them, providing strength and hope. Ravonino carried her, finding renewed energy.

A young student faced a challenging task when unexpectedly called upon to explain his beliefs, despite knowing the subject well. Bound by fear and duty, he bravely defended his faith, seeking guidance and recalling his childhood teachings. However, his efforts failed to sway the Queen's decision to condemn his beliefs. Seeking to divert the Queen's attention from persecution, a plan for a grand journey was proposed. Despite initial obstacles, the idea intrigued the Queen, leading to preparations for a royal procession.

The group set out with a pistol as their only weapon, as their gun was broken. Each carried a spear, a butterfly net, and a basket for specimens. The Secretary even joined in, enthusiastically chasing butterflies. Ebony explained that hunting for nothing but fun or slaughter was not right. Pursuing bees and butterflies for science was the noble cause. He shared his experience of assisting a German naturalist in Texas. Suddenly, an enormous butterfly appeared, and Ebony dashed after it in a frenzy. The group watched Ebony disappear into the trees in pursuit. Mark and Hockins discussed Ebony's behavior and the heat, with Hockins advising against a bath to cool off.|['1.

The Secretary was thrilled about the topic, but Ebony returned, injured and out of breath, with a huge butterfly caught. Mineral springs are found in Madagascar, with warm waters of varying temperatures and healing properties. Ebony found a shaded spot near a fig tree and bamboo leaves, where he enjoyed a warm bath. Later, Mark presented his plant and insect collection to the Queen, who found the insect collection amusing. Hockins played the flageolet for the Queen every evening, although he grew tired of it. Ebony, preparing supper, reminded them of the hard work ahead. The expedition faced challenges when some were discovered hiding in a rice-house, claiming to be praying people willing to face consequences for their beliefs.

Ranavalona's expression changed, losing interest in Mark's collections and the musical seaman. Reports arrived that her soldiers had captured fugitives, marching them in chains to the capital. The Queen halted on a hill to watch the captives' arrival. They approached, tired and scared, with children weeping silently. Women walked freely, but the chained men followed, guarded closely. Among them were familiar faces like Rafaravavy and Ramatoa. Hockins and his friends were shocked, unable to move. The captives, unaware of the onlookers, trudged past in silence. Ranavalona, in silence and with a stern expression, ordered the camp to be set up. The Queen, despite her illness, commanded the host to return home swiftly.

In a prison cell, a group of captives awaited their fate. Among them, the stout chief Voalavo, usually cheerful, now raged against their impending doom. He tried to break free from his chains but fell, whispering a prayer. While some women resigned themselves to their destiny, others struggled with fear. Ra-Ruth, trembling and pale, found solace in her strong friend Ramatoa. Suddenly, armed men led by Silver Spear entered. Laihova, watching Ra-Ruth closely, tried to save her but was stopped by his chains. Ra-Ruth and twelve others were chosen for execution.

During a time of intense suffering, many Christians bravely faced persecution for their faith. Despite losing their possessions, freedom, and even their lives, they stood firm in their beliefs. Some were sold into slavery, others were flogged and sentenced to hard labor, while many were stripped of their titles and honors. Among them was Prince Ramonja, who had helped protect Christians. Although some were spared execution due to insanity claims, hope was scarce. In the prison, despair loomed large, especially for Reni-Mamba, who became unresponsive upon hearing her son's fate.

Prince Rakota, the queen's son and rightful heir, faced opposition from his cousin Rambosalama, who sought to seize the throne through deceit and violence. Despite being warned of assassination attempts, Prince Rakota refused to resort to savage methods to protect his claim. Instead, he relied on the loyalty of his friends and the Commander-in-Chief of the troops. With a plan in place and the palace guarded, Prince Rakota asked his trusted Secretary to confront Rambosalama when he passed through the passage, signaling a revolt.

The loyal Commander-in-Chief was vigilant and had a plan. He observed Rambosalama's actions in the chamber of mourning. When the Prince left to signal his followers, the Commander-in-Chief discreetly gave a counter-signal by waving a scarf from a window. A trumpet sounded, and over a thousand soldiers entered the palace. The Commander-in-Chief then announced the Queen's passing and declared Rakota as King Radama the Second. The people rejoiced at the change in leadership. King Radama showed mercy by banishing Rambosalama instead of harsh punishment. He promised equal protection, freedom of worship, and released prisoners. The city celebrated the newfound freedom, but not all were joyous.

At a unique gathering, the preacher surprised everyone by announcing two upcoming weddings. One of the grooms was half Malagasy, half English, and desired a simple ceremony. His friend, the other groom, agreed with all his preferences. The couples, Ravonino with Rafaravavy, and Laihova with Ra-Ruth, were joined in matrimony. Radama the Second, Prince Ramonja, and others attended the wedding. Radama, or Rakota, began undoing his mother's wrongs, opening schools and promoting freedom. Mark, Hockins, and Ebony, now free, pondered their next steps. Hockins spoke of his family in England. The King offered Mark a permanent post, but Mark declined, desiring to return home. The group shared a bittersweet final evening with friends before departing on a ship, leaving Madagascar behind for England.|"['1.
