"In the early days of America, the rugged Alleghany region posed a challenge to trade expansion. The French in Canada monopolized the West's trade routes. However, the Pennsylvania Dutch settlers, between the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers, played a crucial role in revolutionizing inland commerce. They bred strong horses that could transport goods across the challenging Alleghany trails. The pack-horse trade with the Ohio Valley's ""far Indians"" thrived in this region. The hardy men of the Cowpens, skilled in horse-lore and trail knowledge, drove herds on horseback through vast woodlands. These cow-pen masters lived off the land, raising cattle and sustaining their families on milk, whey, curds, cheese, and butter. Their resourcefulness and courage paved the way for the expansion of trade routes into the Great West."|"['1.

The historic rivalry between the French and English, culminating in a war, was primarily a battle for trade dominance. French traders at Niagara in 1749 had access to the Ohio River through Lake Erie and various rivers, while the English used paths like Nemacolin and Kittanning. Facing competition from Pennsylvania and Virginia traders, the French struggled due to longer transportation distances and higher prices. To counter English traders, the French fortified the Allegheny and built Fort Duquesne. After the capture of Fort Duquesne in 1758, English expansion beyond the Alleghanies flourished. Settlements like Pittsburgh and Uniontown thrived, marking a shift from Indian trade to supplying frontier settlers. The pack-horse trade evolved to include various goods, with whiskey becoming a valuable commodity. Caravans traded salt and iron for goods in a journey from Baltimore to Fort Cumberland.|['1.

Pennsylvania, situated between Virginia and New York, had a unique geographical advantage. The Susquehanna Valley extended northwest, giving early Pennsylvania developers the idea that they could dominate the Great Lakes trade by focusing on Presq'Isle (Erie, Pennsylvania) as a key hub. The plan involved enhancing water and land routes via the Delaware to Lake Ontario and Lake Otsego, and through eight routes along the Susquehanna River. The construction of the Schuylkill-Susquehanna Canal began in 1791, but attention shifted to improved highways like the Lancaster Turnpike. The Union Canal, completed in 1827, was part of Pennsylvania's canal system. In New York, the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company was formed in 1792 to improve transportation routes, inspired by Elkanah Watson's vision for economic growth. The company faced challenges but eventually succeeded in enhancing river navigation.|"['1.

In the early 1800s, White and Hazard, wire manufacturers, were impressed by the quality of Lehigh coal. They decided to form a company with Hauto and Hazard to secure a lease of the Lehigh mines for twenty years, paying just one ear of corn annually. The company agreed to transport forty thousand bushels of coal to Philadelphia each year to showcase the mine's value. Seeking to improve navigation on the Lehigh River, they obtained permission from the Legislature. Despite doubts, the Legislature granted them the opportunity. The company received public funding under the condition that the feasibility of the project be assessed. While the river improvement was seen as promising, the nine-mile road to the mines was deemed impractical. The public had mixed opinions on the venture, with some skeptical about the coal mine but optimistic about the river improvement.

"During the early 19th century, the Mississippi River and its branches, notably the Ohio River, played a crucial role in American inland commerce. Craftsmen known for their expertise in handling boats were prominent along the Atlantic rivers but found their most significant contributions in the westward rivers. The commerce along these rivers saw a variety of vessels, from flatboats to barges, used to transport goods like flour, salt, and iron from the Ohio country to the South. Pittsburgh, a town initially established in 1764, emerged as a vital trade hub despite its humble beginnings. With the conclusion of Indian wars and the opening of territories beyond the Ohio River for settlement, cities like Pittsburgh, Marietta, and Cincinnati experienced rapid growth and industrial development. Louisville, known as the ""Little Falls"" of the West, thrived as a key trade center, particularly in the tobacco industry.

Western towns like Erie, Sandusky, and Detroit were established as ports of entry in 1799. Fort Massac, Illinois, was the first port on the Ohio River to report on the character and volume of river traffic in 1800. The trade included various goods like flour, whiskey, pork, bacon, and dry goods. The connection between western trade and the politics of the Mississippi Valley, leading up to the Louisiana Purchase, was a crucial aspect of this era. The construction of ocean-going vessels on the Ohio River aimed to make the West independent of Spanish middlemen and expand trade opportunities. The growth of the shipbuilding industry led to customs collection districts being readjusted, with ports like Marietta and Cincinnati playing key roles. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 boosted inland shipbuilding, but the embargo of 1807 dealt a severe blow to the industry.|['1.

Ships and navigation conditions on the Great Lakes were similar to those on the ocean. A potential trade route between Illinois and Ohio was envisioned to be as profitable as that between Massachusetts and New York. However, the Great Lakes lacked a suitable outlet for trade, unlike the older colonies on the Atlantic. Concerns arose about Canada's control of the St. Lawrence River and the trade routes of the Northwest through the Welland Canal. Despite these challenges, the rapid growth of the West was underestimated. The development of canals, like the proposed one to connect Lake Erie with the Mississippi, was initially seen as distant future prospects. Yet, the increasing population of states like Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois demanded better transportation for their surplus products. Canals were constructed to facilitate trade, with De Witt Clinton, known for the Erie Canal, being involved in the projects. Ohio sought a northern outlet to Eastern markets via Lake Erie due to transportation difficulties faced with the Ohio River route. The construction of canals like the Ohio Canal and Illinois-Michigan Canal aimed to improve trade connectivity and boost economic growth.|"[""1.

The Ohio Canal, opened in 1833, significantly impacted Lake Erie's commerce. Before its opening, Cleveland had only supplied a Buffalo firm with a thousand bushels of wheat. However, in its first year, the Ohio Canal brought over a quarter of a million bushels of wheat, fifty thousand barrels of flour, and over a million pounds of butter and lard to Cleveland. In return, the markets sent thirty thousand barrels of salt and over five million pounds of merchandise to Ohio by canal. The Welland Canal, built between 1824 and 1832, was Canada's response to the Erie Canal, connecting Lake Erie with Lake Ontario. This led to the opening of the St. Lawrence and Rideau canal systems. The Illinois and Michigan Canal, though faced with challenges, was completed in 1848, uniting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi Basin and greatly benefiting Chicago's growth and prosperity.|"[""1.
