In December 1902, the American Historical Association approved a plan to create a series of classical narratives that form the foundation of early United States history. The purpose was to provide readers with a comprehensive collection of these narratives, ensuring they are accessible to schools, colleges, and individual history enthusiasts. The series aims to showcase classical narratives that are crucial to understanding American history before 1700, offering readers a direct connection to the nation's founders. The series will include volumes covering the early history of different parts of the country, with maps to aid in understanding the events narrated. The texts will be taken from the earliest editions, and each volume will have introductions and annotations to help readers grasp the historical significance of the narratives. The project aims to enrich the understanding of early American history by presenting these pioneer narratives in a comprehensive collection.|"['1.

In the early 15th century, Christopher Columbus embarked on a series of voyages that led to the discovery of new lands. His first voyage took him to the Canary Islands and the Lesser Antilles, where he encountered the indigenous people and their customs. Columbus's interactions with the Caribbees revealed signs of cannibalism among them. As he continued exploring, he reached Trinidad and eventually sighted the mainland of South America. Despite facing storms and challenges, Columbus traded with the natives and collected gold nuggets. Upon arriving at Española, he established a settlement named Isabella and learned about the local culture, food, and products. Despite setbacks and rebellions, Columbus's voyages marked a significant chapter in history, expanding European knowledge of the world.|"[""1.

"The tale that has endured the scrutiny of modern analysis, notably the ""Saga of Eric the Red,"" holds an added advantage of being preserved in two different vellum manuscripts. One is housed in Hauk's Book, No. 544 of the Arne-Magnæan Collection in Copenhagen, and the other in No. 557 of the same collection. These two versions recount the same story, with the translation in this volume being a blend of both texts, leaning more towards Hauk's Book (544) due to its clearer legibility compared to No. 557. The author of Hauk's Book, Hauk Erlendsson, a lawman in Iceland in 1294, passed away in Norway in 1334. The vellum bearing his name was likely penned between 1310-1320. While 544 and 557 both mention Bishop Brand ""the Elder,"" indicating a composition post-1263, the saga's classic form and strong tradition hint at an earlier origin around 1200."|"['1.

"The Vinland voyages hold a strong tradition passed down from two sources, a unique occurrence among Icelandic sagas. Although these sources may clash on certain details, American scholars find the narratives generally true. Old Norse scholarship determines the more reliable Vinland saga between Hauk's Book and AM. 557. The simpler narrative proves more trustworthy, aligning better with Icelandic saga characteristics and historical facts. Discrepancies arise, like the first sighting of land by Biarni Herjulfson, raising doubts. The ""Saga of Eric the Red"" confirms Leif Ericson's priority in discovery, while the Flat Island Book narrative includes unique details like the length of Vinland's day and skin-canoes with three men each. Despite some inconsistencies, the Flat Island Book account remains a straightforward narrative, needing circumspection when compared to other historical facts. Dr. Storm's work, detailed in _The Finding of Wineland_, provides valuable insights on the subject, including possible identifications of regions visited by the Northmen. The question of whether the savages encountered were Indians or Eskimos remains debated, with American scholars leaning towards American Indians."|"['1.

The Norse colonists in Greenland did not encounter any natives but found remnants of them, as the natives were further north at that time. The colonists eventually interacted with them, referred to as Skrellings. The absence of descriptions of the natives in Icelandic sagas indicates that they were not well-documented. The _Speculum Regale_ and Ivar Bardsen's accounts support this notion, emphasizing the lack of encounters with natives until the fourteenth century. Despite uncertainties about the specific indigenous groups encountered, historical evidence confirms Leif Ericson and Thorfinn Karlsefni's expeditions to North America in the early eleventh century. Recent challenges to the chronology of these voyages by Vigfusson have raised questions that require further confirmation. The _Origines Islandicae_ publication lacks updated insights from Dr. Storm, suggesting gaps in the research. The inclusion of Adam of Bremen's account aligns with Icelandic traditions of Vinland, reinforcing the saga narratives' credibility. Additional translations and analyses by scholars like Reeves provide valuable perspectives on the Norse explorations.|"[""1.

In the saga of Eric the Red, also known as the Saga of Thorfinn Karlsefni and Snorri Thorbrandsson, the story unfolds with Olaf the White, a warrior-king, the son of King Ingiald. Olaf ventured on a Western freebooting expedition and seized Dublin, ruling over the Shire of Dublin. He wed Aud the Wealthy, daughter of Ketil Flatnose, and fathered Thorstein the Red. Olaf met his demise in an Irish battle, prompting Aud and Thorstein to relocate to the Hebrides. Thorstein, marrying Thurid, allied with Earl Sigurd the Mighty, conquering regions in Scotland. Thorstein met his end in a Scottish battle, leading Aud to build a ship in secret and sail to the Orkneys. Aud arranged Groa's marriage to Earl Thorfinn, then set sail for Iceland with twenty freemen, settling in the Dale country. Aud, a devout Christian, erected crosses at Krossholar, demonstrating her faith. Vifil, one of the former captives, received Vifilsdal from Aud and raised his sons, Thorbiorn and Thorgeir, promisingly.|"['1.

Eric the Red discovered Greenland. He left Iceland due to a conflict and settled in Hornstrandir. After his father's death, Eric married Thorhild and moved to Ericsstadir in Haukadal. When Eric's thralls caused trouble, leading to conflicts, he was banished. Eric then moved to Eyxney and demanded his possessions back from Thorgest. A dispute arose, resulting in casualties. Outlawed, Eric prepared a ship for a voyage to find new land. With companions, he sailed to Blacksark and explored the region. Returning to Greenland, Eric settled and named the land. His journey to Greenland was to create a new settlement, as he believed a good name like Greenland would attract settlers.|"[""1.

About Karlsefni and Thorhall. Thorhall wanted to sail northward beyond Wonder-strands to find Wineland, while Karlsefni aimed to go southward along the coast. Thorhall, with only nine men, set sail below the island as the rest joined Karlsefni. One day, Thorhall recited a verse lamenting the lack of wine in the land. Karlsefni's group, sailing north, faced westerly gales, leading them to Ireland where they were mistreated. Meanwhile, Karlsefni sailed south and discovered a river that flowed into a lake. They named it Hop and found wheat fields, vines, and abundant fish. They encountered strangers in skin-canoes, traded goods, and observed their peculiar appearance. Karlsefni and his group settled above the lake for the winter, engaging in trade with the Skrellings for pelts and red cloth.|"[""1.

Karlsefni and his group encountered a bull that caused the Skrellings to flee. Three weeks later, a large number of Skrellings in boats approached Karlsefni's group waving staves and shouting. A battle ensued, with the Skrellings using war-slings. Freydis, a woman in Karlsefni's group, showed bravery in the face of danger. Despite losses on both sides, Karlsefni's group decided to return home due to constant threats from the Skrellings. While sailing northward, they encountered sleeping Skrellings whom they suspected had been banished. Karlsefni's group found abundant resources at Streamfirth before some members split off on different expeditions. Karlsefni eventually set out to find Thorhall the Huntsman. The group sailed around Keelness and discovered a densely wooded area with a river flowing westward, where they decided to anchor.|"[""1.

One morning, Karlsefni and his group saw a shining speck in the woods. It turned out to be a Uniped who shot an arrow at Thorvald, Eric's son. Thorvald, feeling the arrow, remarked on the fat around his belly, indicating a fertile land but no profit. Sadly, Thorvald succumbed to the injury. The Uniped fled north, chased by Karlsefni's men. They believed they had found the land of the Unipeds and decided to sail back north. Trouble brewed among the men due to women, leading to factions. Snorri, Karlsefni's son, was born, and they sailed away from Wineland, encountering Skrellings in Markland. They taught the Skrelling boys language, baptized them, and learned about their homeland. Eventually, they returned to Greenland, where Biarni and his group faced a perilous situation at sea and made a tough decision to save some but were never heard of again.|"['1.

The story so far is from Landnama-bok, an important Icelandic source on early history. It could have included a paragraph about the colonization of Greenland. Ari, Thorgil's son, mentioned that twenty-five ships sailed to Greenland, but only fourteen made it. This happened about sixteen years before Iceland officially adopted Christianity, around 985. This voyage marked the first direct trip from Greenland to Norway, bypassing Iceland to avoid a perilous route. King Olaf ruled from 995 to 1000 and perished in battle in 1000. It was in that same year that Leif set out as a missionary to Greenland. There is debate about a wild cereal found, possibly Indian corn or wild rice, not cultivated fields. Thorfinn may have chosen a different path to succeed where Thorstein failed. The journey was estimated at about one hundred miles per day. The explorers landed at Keelness and named the shores Wonderstrands due to their length.|"[""1.

Long ago, explorers journeyed to Vinland, where they encountered the Skrælingar, believed to be the Micmac Indians. These explorers used a disparaging term for the natives, meaning inferior people. The saga describes the land as possibly farther south than Nova Scotia, with references to grape-bearing vines. There are mentions of a one-legged race, similar to other medieval beliefs. The explorers, skilled mariners, recognized the same mountains from different coasts. The names recorded in the saga remain uncertain, with debates on their origins.

"In the 11th century, Thorlak, a bishop, was born in 1085 and died in 1133. His birth year is certain, aiding in calculating the birth years of others. For instance, Hallfrid was likely born around 1060, her father around 1030, and Karlsefni as far back as 1000. This information challenges the traditional timeline of the Vinland voyages, suggesting Leif's earlier generation than Karlsefni. Biorn, another bishop, succeeded Thorlak and died in 1162. The records referring to Bishop Brand ""the Elder"" indicate that the texts were likely written after 1263.

After Eric's banishment from Haukadal, he settled in Eyxney at Ericsstadir in Breidafirth. Disputes arose with Thorgest over daïs-boards Eric loaned but couldn't retrieve. Backed by allies, Eric faced off against the Thorgesters, leading to his outlaw status at Thorsnessthing. Eric then set sail from Ericsvag to find the land Gunnbiorn saw, naming his landfall Midiokul, now Blacksark. He explored, wintering at Ericsey and Holmar before returning to Iceland. He named the land he discovered Greenland and later colonized it. Eric's son, Leif, was baptized in Norway. Biarni, Heriulf's son, voyaged to Greenland, inspired by his father's journey. Heriulf, a kinsman of Ingolf, settled between Vag and Reykianess. Biarni, a skilled voyager, owned a trading-ship and joined his father on the voyage to Greenland.|"['1.

Heriulf settled at Heriulfsness and was a respected man. Eric the Red lived at Brattahlid, highly esteemed by all. Eric had children: Leif, Thorvald, Thorstein, and a daughter named Freydis, who married Thorvard and lived at Gardar. Freydis, proud and wedded for wealth, was haughty, unlike her weak-willed husband. The people of Greenland were heathen. Biarni, arriving at Eyrar in Iceland, decided to sail to Greenland despite the crew's doubts. They sailed for days, encountering different lands. Biarni's crew wanted to land for wood and water, but Biarni refused, causing discontent. They sailed on, passing various lands, until they reached one that resembled Greenland, where Biarni decided to land near Heriulf's dwelling at Heriulfsness.

The Brief History of the Greenlanders begins with Biarni Heriulfsson's journey from Greenland to visit Earl Eric, where he was warmly welcomed. Biarni faced criticism for not exploring new lands during his travels. Leif, Eric the Red's son, bought a ship from Biarni and set out on an expedition with 35 men. They discovered new lands, naming them Helluland and Markland. Finally, they reached a land with sweet dew, abundant salmon, and mild winters, ideal for settlement. Leif divided the group for exploration, ensuring they returned by evening. Leif, a wise and just leader, led the expedition with strength and intelligence.|['1.

Thorvald, advised by his brother Leif, decided to sail to Wineland with thirty men. They reached Leif's-booths in Wineland, where they spent the winter fishing for food. In the spring, Thorvald suggested exploring the western coast. They found a beautiful, wooded land with white sands, islands, and no human dwellings except for a grain shelter. While exploring, they encountered hostile natives in skin-canoes. Thorvald got wounded and advised his men to return to the pleasant headland where they buried him. The crew gathered grapes and wood, then sailed back to Greenland, reaching Ericsfirth with exciting tales for Leif. Meanwhile, Thorstein Ericsson, with his wife Gudrid, set sail for Wineland to retrieve Thorvald's body but got lost at sea. They landed in Greenland due to a storm, where they were kindly welcomed by Thorstein the Swarthy, a man of different faith, and provided them with shelter.|"['1.

"**Freydis Causes the Brothers to be Put to Death**

Many spoke of a voyage to Wineland, a profitable and honorable journey. Upon Karlsefni's return from Wineland, two brothers, Helgi and Finnbogi, arrived from Norway in Greenland. Freydis, Eric's daughter, invited the brothers to sail to Wineland with her. Despite an agreement for equal shares, Freydis concealed extra men on board. Arriving in Wineland, a dispute arose over accommodations. Freydis, feeling wronged, plotted revenge. Early one morning, she approached the brothers' house and lured them outside, where she attacked and killed them. She then murdered the women. Freydis warned her companions never to speak of the incident. They loaded the ship with goods and returned to Greenland, claiming the brothers remained alive.

Freydis returned home after a period away, finding her dwelling unharmed. She generously gifted her companions, hoping to conceal her wrongdoing. However, rumors of their misdeeds spread, reaching her brother Leif. Disgusted, Leif forced Freydis's companions to confess, revealing a shameful tale. Although he couldn't punish his sister, Leif predicted a grim future for their descendants. Meanwhile, Karlsefni sailed to Norway, where he and his wife were warmly welcomed. After a successful winter selling goods, they prepared to return to Iceland. Before departing, a Southerner offered gold for a mysterious item from Wineland, which Karlsefni sold. Upon returning to Iceland, Karlsefni settled in Skagafirth, where he and his wife Gudrid established a prominent lineage. Gudrid later became an anchorite, living out her days in seclusion.

The explorers in the Flat Island Book narrative were remarkably accurate in finding 'Leif's-booths' in a land as unfamiliar as Greenland was to Biarni. These terms refer to the sun's positions at different times. Early interpreters had more success with this observation than later ones with modern tools. Rafn suggested Vinland was in Rhode Island based on this, but Storm and Reeves couldn't determine Vinland's exact location. Captain Phythian states the explorers were likely no farther north than Lat. 49°. The _Landnama-bok_ mentions Gudrid, who married Thorstein, son of Eric the Red, and later Thorfinn Karlsefni. Vinland, known for wild vines and abundant unsown grain, lies beyond an island discovered by many. Adam of Bremen's work includes the first printed references to Vinland, where the sun shines for days in summer.|"[""1.

In the year 1347, a ship arrived from Greenland, smaller than typical Icelandic trading vessels. It entered the outer Stream-firth without an anchor, carrying seventeen men who had been driven there by storms after sailing to Markland. This account is found in various Icelandic annals, including the Annales Regii. The entry under 1121 is the sole surviving mention of Vinland in older Icelandic records. Bishop Eric Gnupson, also known as Eric Uppsi, was an early figure in Greenland's history. The Greenlanders faced hardships after a pagan invasion destroyed their temples and churches, leaving only nine standing. The people, lacking priests or bishops for thirty years, sought help to restore divine worship. The Pope was moved by their plight and directed nearby bishops to investigate and provide support if needed.|"['1.

Long ago, in the remote diocese of Gardar in Greenland, people struggled due to the lack of essential supplies like bread, wine, and oil. Surviving mainly on dried fish and milk, they rarely saw ships due to the icy terrain and scarce resources. With no bishop or priest for eighty years, the residents had forgotten their Catholic faith. To address this, Bishop Matthias, a devoted member of the Order of St. Benedict, was chosen to guide the community back to their beliefs. To support his mission, all letters destined for Gardar were to be written free of charge.

In 1409, the last notice of Greenland was recorded, mentioning a marriage ceremony conducted by Endride Andreson, the final bishop. Conflict between Greenlanders and Eskimos arose in the 14th century, with Ivar Bardsen leading an expedition against the Eskimos who had taken over the Western Settlement. By the time they arrived, the Eskimos had left, leaving behind ruins and roaming cattle. There are uncertainties about the final fate of the Greenland settlement, whether due to Eskimo invasions, diseases, neglect, trade restrictions, or a mix of these factors. Attempts to search for the Greenland colony continued into the 16th century, with Archbishop Valkendorf and others exploring the region. The passage also discusses rewards granted to Don Cristóbal Colon for his planned voyages to discover new territories.|"[""1. What was the main event mentioned in 1409 regarding Greenland?\nA.

In the year 1492, after the war with the Moors in Granada, Christopher Columbus embarked on a historic voyage to India on behalf of the Spanish monarchs. Equipped with three vessels, he set sail from Palos on August 3rd, 1492. The journey was not without challenges, as one of the ships, the _Pinta_, faced rudder issues suspected to be sabotage. Despite setbacks, Columbus and his crew navigated towards the Canaries, encountering varying opinions on their location. After repairs in Gomera, they finally departed on September 6th. The voyage was meticulously recorded by Columbus, detailing each day's events and navigational efforts.

He set sail from the port of Gomera in the morning, steering westward after learning that Portuguese ships were in pursuit. The day was calm, and by nightfall, he found himself between Gomera and Tenerife. The wind picked up from the northeast on Saturday night, and the Admiral adjusted his course to the west, battling rough seas that slowed progress. Despite the challenges, they covered 9 leagues. The following day, they managed 19 leagues, intentionally underestimating to keep the crew calm. As they sailed westward, they encountered debris from a ship and strong currents. The Admiral remained optimistic, noting the pleasant weather and signs of land, like green grass and crabs, indicating they were nearing their destination.

On this day, the journey continued with the Admiral noting a distance of 48 leagues while actually covering over 55 leagues. The sea remained calm, resembling a river in Seville. Martin Alonso on the _Pinta_ sailed ahead after spotting birds flying westward, hinting at land nearby. A large cloud in the north signaled land's proximity. Despite calm weather, only 25 leagues were traveled due to light winds. Boobies, not known to stray far from land, visited the ship. Drizzling rain without wind further indicated land was close. The Admiral pressed on towards the Indies, confident of islands to the north and south. The pilots calculated distances to the Canaries as the ship navigated through calm seas with sightings of land-birds and booby birds, affirming the nearing land.|"['1.

The crew aboard the ship shaped a course N.W., occasionally veering more northerly. They covered about 22 leagues, spotting a dove, a booby, another river-bird, and white birds. Amongst the weed, they discovered crabs. Initially, the sea was calm, prompting murmurs from the crew about the lack of wind for their return to Spain. Suddenly, the sea swelled without wind, surprising them. The Admiral compared this to the time of the Jews leaving Egypt. As the day progressed, calm turned to wind. At sunset, joy erupted as land was sighted. The crew celebrated, giving thanks. However, the land turned out to be clouds. Despite this, they continued westward, making 24 leagues, with a smooth sea and pleasant air. They also observed various seabirds and fish.|['1.

The ship sailed westward, covering 14 leagues in a day and night due to calm weather. Boatswain-birds and boobies signaled possible land nearby. The crew also spotted much weed and observed the stars' movements. The Admiral noted the needles' variations at nightfall and dawn. They continued west, making 25 leagues, experiencing heavy rain. The crew was informed of a distance of 578 leagues from Hierro, although the actual distance was 707 leagues. Progressing further west, they covered 39 leagues, encountering smooth seas, fish sightings, and a white gull. Traveling 47 leagues, they encountered sandpipers and old and fresh weed. The Admiral aimed to avoid delays and reach the Indies promptly. Sailing on, they made 63 leagues, seeing sandpipers, boobies, and flying-fish. The day and night journey covered 57 leagues with pleasant weather and no weed.|"['1.

The Admiral sailed west for 40 leagues, with Martin Alonso suggesting a southwesterly course. The Admiral noted the need to reach land sooner and decided to head towards the continent before the islands. The _Niña_ signaled land sighted, but no land was seen. Birds flying indicated possible nearby land. The Admiral, aware of birds leading to discoveries, changed course to W.S.W. They sailed about 28 leagues. The sea was calm, the air gentle, and the weed fresh. Land-birds were spotted, and some were caught. The journey continued with varying speeds, covering 59 leagues in total. Despite complaints, the Admiral encouraged the crew, determined to reach the Indies with the help of the Lord.|"[""1.

Today, at sunrise, I raised the anchors from my ship and anchored off the southwest point of Saometo Island, which I named Cabo de la Laguna, and Isabella Island. My plan was to sail northeast and east from the southeast and south, where I was told by the local people that the king's village was located. However, the sea was too shallow for navigation in that direction, so I decided to return the way I came from the northeast to the western part of the island. The caravels also anchored near the shore, expecting me to anchor as well, but I decided not to. After exploring the island and finding it even more beautiful, green, and fertile than the others I had seen, I discovered a village where the inhabitants fled upon our arrival. Despite finding valuable fruits and aloes, I respected the natives' property and only asked for water, which they gladly provided. I plan to fill the ships with water here and continue my journey to other islands, seeking gold and spices.|"['1.

Last night and today, I waited to see if the king or someone else would bring gold or valuable items. Many people from this island, like those from other islands, came, all naked and painted in different colors. They bartered darts and cotton for bits of glass and earthenware with the sailors. Some had gold in their noses which they traded for glass beads. However, there was little gold. The locals were amazed by small gifts, thinking we were from heaven. We collected water from a lagoon near Cape of the Islet. We planned to sail to the island of Cuba, which we believe is Cipango, known for its riches. The lack of wind delayed our departure. At midnight, we set sail towards Cuba, following the directions given by the locals.|"['1.

The Admiral set sail from the port towards the west to reach a city where the Indians mentioned a king resided. He navigated along the coast, passing by several points and rivers. The Admiral named the first river Rio de la Luna and the second Rio de Mares. As they ventured further, they encountered villages with unique houses made of palm branches. The houses were clean and well-furnished with carved images and masks. The locals had dogs that didn't bark and tamed wild birds. The Admiral observed the abundance of fishing tools and nets but ordered his crew not to disturb anything. He marveled at the taste of the fruits and trees on the island. The nights were serene with birds singing and crickets chirping, creating a soothing atmosphere. The Admiral praised the beauty of the island and the calmness of the sea, likening it to the river at Seville. The water in the rivers was salty at the mouth, and the natives had access to sweet water in their houses. The Admiral named the river and port San Salvador and described the surrounding mountains as lofty and picturesque. He continued his journey, discovering more landmarks and planning to send a present and a letter to the king of the land beyond the cape.|['1.

On Tuesday night, the explorer faced challenges sailing against the wind. He spotted a river but couldn't enter due to its narrow entrance. The local Indians believed ships could navigate anywhere their canoes could. Continuing, he reached a cape surrounded by sunken rocks and found a bay suitable for small vessels. However, a change in wind direction forced him to turn back towards Rio de Mares. The next day, his crew encountered deserted houses, and a cautious man approached them. Assured of their peaceful intentions, more natives arrived in canoes offering goods. The explorer sought gold, known as _nucay_, but found none. The locals indicated merchants would visit in three days to trade and share news about their king. The explorer observed their customs and lack of religion, noting similarities to other islands. He sent two men, including a former Jew fluent in languages, on a diplomatic mission to establish friendly relations with the local king.|"['1.

This night, the Admiral used a quadrant to measure his altitude and found it to be 42 degrees from the equator. He estimated that he had traveled 1142 leagues from the island of Hierro. The next morning, he explored a river that resembled a vast lake at its mouth, providing an excellent port for ships with deep waters and a clear seabed. The Admiral discovered fresh water two leagues from the river mouth. Climbing a small mountain, he observed the lush surroundings but could not see far due to dense tree foliage. The Admiral encountered indigenous people who traded cotton threads and hammocks. He learned about cinnamon trees from his crew members and locals, who also mentioned gold, pearls, and rumors of cannibals with unusual features. The Admiral intended to wait for his envoys' return before exploring further.|"['1.

Last night, the Admiral recounted the return of two men sent to explore the interior. They discovered a village with 50 houses and around a thousand inhabitants. The villagers welcomed them with great ceremony, believing they were from heaven. The Spaniards showed them spices and were asked to stay for five days. The natives touched them, marveling at their presence. The men described the Christians as good people, and the women checked if they were flesh and bones. The villagers wanted to accompany the Spaniards, thinking they were returning to heaven. The Admiral considered bringing them to the Sovereigns. The villagers did not return the next day as promised. The Spaniards found a fertile land with yams, beans, corn, and cotton. The Admiral admired the people's innocence and hoped they would embrace Christianity.|['1.

The Admiral set sail from the port of Mares early in the morning to visit an island named Babeque, highly spoken of by the Indians on board. According to them, the locals gather gold on the beach at night using candles, then shape it into bars with hammers. To reach the island, they needed to head southeast. After sailing 8 leagues along the coast, they spotted a river. Four more leagues brought them to another large river. The Admiral chose not to stop or explore these rivers, as the weather was favorable to search for Babeque. He believed that if there were a famous city nearby, it would be visible from the sea. The Admiral also observed that the natives were gentle, had no religion but believed in a God in heaven, and were willing to adopt Christian customs. He noted the abundance of gold, precious stones, pearls, spices, and mastic in the region. The Admiral also mentioned the potential for cotton trade and the excellent port for establishing a town and fort. Additionally, he detained natives to bring back to Spain, believing that having women from their land would make them more cooperative and help bridge language barriers.|"[""1.

On the same night, a man about 45 years old, the father of three children - two girls and a boy, approached in a canoe. He requested to join them and expressed his gratitude for being with a relative. The Admiral decided to halt further exploration towards the north due to the cold weather. The following day, he steered east by south, covering 18 leagues and reaching a cape named Cabo de Cuba. The ships struggled against the wind at night, but by morning, they spotted a mountain opening indicating the division between Cuba and Bohio. The Admiral sailed towards Babeque, an island rich in gold, but strong winds forced them to change course to the east. The Admiral marveled at the tall, lush islands in the area, naming the region La Mar de Nuestra Señora and a nearby haven Puerto del Principe.|['1.

The Admiral explored the islands in small boats and found abundant mastic and aloes. Some islands had roots for making bread. Fires were lit in some places, but no fresh water was found. Natives were seen but fled. The sea around the islands had a depth of 15-16 fathoms with sandy bottoms. The Admiral left crosses on all the lands he visited. He discovered two large trees that formed a perfect cross. The Admiral envisioned building a fortress in the area for potential trade. Returning to the ship, large shells were fished up, but no pearls were found. They found unique animals and fish resembling pigs. The Admiral continued exploring more islands with fresh water springs and lush vegetation. The day ended with setting up a cross on a beautiful site with a breathtaking view.|['1.

The Admiral set sail early in the morning in calm weather. By afternoon, a breeze from the east allowed him to steer northeast. At sunset, he spotted Puerto del Principe to the southwest, 7 leagues away. The island of Babeque was sighted about 60 miles to the east. Throughout the night, he continued northeast covering 60 miles and another dozen miles by ten o'clock the next day. The Admiral decided to return to Puerto del Principe, 25 leagues away, due to rough seas and lack of progress towards the south islands he wanted to explore. Despite attempting to reach the port, the current drifted them northwest. The wind changed direction, and the Admiral altered course towards the east-northeast. By the next evening, Puerto del Principe was 48 miles southwest. The next day, he faced challenging seas but managed to cover 24 miles by evening. Martin Alonso Pinzon, in pursuit of gold, left the fleet against the Admiral's wishes.

Upon anchoring the ship, the Admiral swiftly boarded a boat to assess the port, resembling a hammer in shape. As he faced the entrance, a river mouth on the south side was wide enough for a galley but hidden until close. Navigating, he found a depth of 5 to 8 fathoms. The beauty of the trees, clear water, and birds made the experience delightful. The Admiral wished to share this enchanting scene with the Sovereigns, noting a thousand tongues or his hand couldn't do it justice. He desired credible witnesses to see it. The Admiral pondered the potential benefits of the land, despite language barriers and natives' fleeing. He aimed to explore, learn, convert, and build a city, praising the fertile land and favorable climate. The Admiral sought to make the people Christians, emphasizing Spain's role and the importance of Catholicism.|"[""1.

When the sun rose, the Admiral found himself four leagues away from a newly discovered port, which he named Puerto Maria. He also named a cape to the south Cabo de la Estrella. The island appeared to have various points of interest, like a point 28 miles to the south, another point 40 miles to the east resembling an island, and Cabo del Elefante 54 miles east. There was a bay 20 miles away that seemed like a river mouth. The Admiral noticed a large opening between Cabo del Elefante and Cabo de Cinquin, where some sailors thought it formed an island called Isla de la Tortuga. The island had high land with beautiful valleys and well-cultivated crops. That night, they saw fires and smoke, possibly signals of war. The Admiral reached the port of Puerto de San Nicolas, which he found astonishingly beautiful and excellent. He noted its depth, cleanliness, and the abundance of fruit-bearing trees. The port had a river flowing into it and was open and clear of trees. The Admiral was eager to explore further in search of trade opportunities before returning.|['1.

At sunrise, the Admiral set sail from St. Nicholas port. He sailed west for two leagues until he reached Carenero, then turned east towards Cabo Cinquin, a 48-mile journey with 20 miles along an E.N.E. coast. The coast was high with deep waters close to shore. The Admiral was pleased as he sailed with a southwest wind. He noted that the cape near St. Nicholas could be an island if cut through. He discovered a valley with crops before Cabo Cinquin, indicating potential habitation. Off Cabo Cinquin, a high rock served as a landmark. Continuing east, he observed valleys, plains, and mountains reminiscent of Spain. He entered Puerto de la Concepcion due to threatening weather, finding fish and flora similar to those in Castile. The harbor was safe except from the north wind, well-protected by Tortuga Island.|['1.

Today, it rained and the weather was cold, similar to an October day in Castile. The Admiral described a very large island with well-cultivated parts. He believed the villages were located inland, as the people fled when ships arrived, signaling like they were at war. The port was spacious, clean, and safe for ships to anchor. The Admiral sent men to communicate with the natives inland but found no people or houses, only hovels and signs of fires. The island was named Isla Española. The wind blew from the northeast, causing the ships to drag anchors. The Admiral wanted to explore the channel between the islands and the beautiful island of Española. The Indians spoke of other large islands nearby. The Admiral's crew found mastic trees and fish like those in Castile.|"['1.

In the afternoon, the king boarded the ship, where the Admiral welcomed him formally. The Admiral explained that the ships belonged to the rulers of Castile, who were considered the most powerful monarchs. However, the Indians on board, acting as translators, and the king himself did not believe this claim. They thought the Spaniards were from Heaven and that the Castilian rulers must be in Heaven as well. The king was served Spanish food, which he tasted a bit of but then shared with his advisors and tutor. He praised the fertile lands, especially those of the island of Española, stating that they were as much the rulers' as Castile. The natives were described as timid and willing to work and follow orders, indicating they could be easily governed. Later, a canoe from the island of Tortuga arrived with a crew. The king of Tortuga showed goodwill but also displayed a hint of aggression towards the crew, indicating a potential for conflict.|"['1.

The Admiral could not sail to the land he was invited to due to a lack of wind. Instead, he sent some of his crew, including the secretary, with messengers to the nearby villages. The messengers returned with news of abundant gold on the island of Española, where people from other places came to purchase it. The Admiral learned about the gold mining process from the locals. Despite the language barrier, he believed there was a great amount of gold in the area. Many locals visited the ship, bringing gifts. The Admiral hoped to find a gold mine for the service of God. The boats reported a grand road and many canoes leading to the mountain of Caribatan. The Admiral was impressed by the hospitality and gifts given by the locals. He was also introduced to the local chief, who welcomed them warmly.|"['1.

The ruler of the land approached the ship at dawn and expressed his desire for gold before the Admiral's departure, urging him to stay. The king and his kin joined the Admiral for a meal, expressing their wish to travel to Castile with him. News arrived that the ship _Pinta_ was anchored at a nearby river. The local leader sent a canoe to investigate, showcasing his loyalty to the Admiral. Plans were made to expedite the fort construction and decide on the crew's composition for the journey back to Castile. The king, seemingly feigning ignorance, welcomed the Admiral to a designated house. The young nephew of the king shared information about neighboring islands abundant in gold. The king presented the Admiral with a golden mask and requested a washbasin and jug, which the Admiral thought were for decorative purposes. During dinner, five subordinate kings arrived to pay respects to their leader, Guacanagari. The Admiral exchanged gifts with the king, showcasing mutual respect and admiration.|"[""1.

Today, the Admiral was busy ensuring that the ship was stocked with water and fuel for the journey back to Spain. He wanted to inform the Sovereigns promptly so they could send more ships to continue the exploration. The Admiral found the task so significant that he was amazed. He wanted to explore the eastern lands and coast further before leaving for Castile to send back sheep and cattle. However, with only one ship left, he hesitated to face the dangers of further exploration. He was frustrated that the caravel Pinta had separated, causing inconvenience. At midnight, the Admiral sent a boat to fetch rhubarb from the island Amiga. The boat returned with a bundle of rhubarb at dusk, taken to show the Sovereigns. The Admiral left behind 39 men on the island of Española, known as Bohio, with provisions and instructions for trade and exploration.|"[""1.

The port provides protection from most winds, except those from the north and N.W., which rarely occur here. Even when these winds blow, shelter can be found near the islet in 3 or 4 fathoms. In the morning, the Admiral set sail along the coast to the east, watching out for stone and sand reefs with good anchorages within. By noon, a strong east wind blew, prompting the Admiral to send a sailor up the mast to spot reefs. The caravel _Pinta_ soon joined the Admiral after parting ways earlier. Due to rocky seabeds, they returned to Monte Cristi. Martin Alonso Pinzon excused his departure, but the Admiral believed it was due to pride and greed. Pinzon went in search of gold on Baneque Island and Española, while the Admiral aimed to explore Juana and Española. They heard of an island with abundant gold, and the Admiral prepared for further exploration with a new crew to avoid mutiny.|"['1.

The Admiral boarded a boat and navigated up a river near Monte Cristi, towards the S.S.W. to fetch fresh water for the ships. At the river mouth, he discovered an abundance of very fine gold, both in powder form and grains as large as lentils. To prevent saltwater contamination, they collected freshwater a stone's throw up the river, where they noticed gold specks on the cask hoops. Naming the river Rio del Oro, the Admiral found it deep inside the bar but shallow at the mouth. He sailed to Punta Roja, anchoring safely near Monte Cristi. The area featured high lands with lush plains and streams, teeming with turtles.

At midnight, the Admiral set sail from Rio de Gracia with a gentle breeze, heading east towards Cape Belprado, four leagues away. Further southeast lies the majestic Monte de Plata mountain, eight leagues distant. Continuing to the Cape Del Angel, 18 leagues away, the Admiral marveled at the stunning lands with high mountains to the east and west. A beautiful port with ample depth awaited at the foot of the mountain. The Admiral, hopeful for rivers and gold, pressed on to Punta Del Hierro, Punta Seca, and Cabo Redondo. Despite not finding anchorage at Cabo Frances, he reached Cabo Del Buen Tiempo and Cabo Tajado. Progressing swiftly, he sighted Cabo De Padre y Hijo and a splendid bay between grand mountains.

The Admiral stayed in the port as there was no wind to sail out. He wanted to move to a safer port and awaited celestial events on the 17th. The crew went ashore for yams and encountered natives with bows and arrows. They bought weapons and spoke with one native who seemed disrespectful. The native had charcoal-stained face and long hair adorned with parrot feathers. The Admiral thought he was a Carib, known for cannibalism. The native mentioned islands with gold to the east. The crew bought weapons but were attacked by the natives. A scuffle ensued, and the crew defended themselves. The Admiral feared for the men left at Navidad. He wished to capture the natives. Smoke signals were seen on the island.|"[""1.

This evening, the Admiral wanted to locate the homes of the Indians, assuming they were Caribs. Due to strong winds and rough seas, he stayed put all day. Many Indians were spotted on land. The Admiral then sent a well-armed crew ashore in a boat. Soon, the Indians approached the boat, led by a man who had visited the day before and received gifts. Accompanying him was a king who had given beads to ensure the crew's safety. The king and three followers boarded the boat and then the caravel. The Admiral gave them food and gifts. The chief promised a gold mask the next day. The Admiral mentioned the caravels' leak issues due to poor caulking but trusted in God and the Crown. He decided to leave after the events with the Indians and planned to visit islands known for gold and copper.|"['1.

The journey began in the early hours before dawn, departing Golfo de las Flechas with a favorable west wind towards Carib Island. This island was known for its inhabitants who instilled fear in others, as they sailed the seas in countless canoes, capturing and consuming men. The crew initially felt disheartened as the Admiral deviated from the direct route due to leaking ships. Eventually, after sailing 64 miles, they changed course towards Spain. The crew sailed 48 miles in the new direction, aiming to avoid the leaky condition of the caravels. The Indians onboard suggested encountering Matinino Island, inhabited solely by women. The Admiral considered capturing some women but prioritized the voyage's safety. The journey continued with fine weather and sightings of gulf-weed, tunnies in the sea, and frigate-birds flying nearby.|"['1.

During the night, they sailed 56 miles N.N.E. and 64 miles N.E. by N. After sunrise, they headed N.E. with a fresh wind from the S.W., then W.S.W. for 84 miles, about 21 leagues. The sea was teeming with small tunas, and they spotted boobies, frigate-birds, and terns. It was calm at night, covering only 20 miles N.E., followed by 11 miles S.E. and 36 miles N.N.E., equivalent to 9 leagues. They encountered numerous small tunas, enjoyed soft, pleasant air like Seville in spring, and the sea was smooth. Frigate-birds, sandpipers, and other birds were also observed. The previous day, they sailed N.E. b. E. at 8 miles an hour until midnight, a total of 56 miles. Later, they sailed N.N.E. at 8 miles an hour, covering 104 miles or 26 leagues. The air got colder as they moved north, and they saw many boatswain-birds and terns, with less fish due to the colder water and abundant weed.|['1.

Tonight the wind was quite changeable. Despite this, they managed to sail 84 miles or 21 leagues in the direction of N.E. by N. The caravel _Niña_ had to wait for the _Pinta_ several times as the latter sailed poorly due to a weak mast. It is suggested that if the _Pinta's_ captain, Martin Alonso Pinzon, had replaced the mast with a better one from the Indies, where quality spars are abundant, instead of abandoning the commander out of greed, it would have been a wiser choice. They spotted many boatswain-birds and a lot of seaweed. The sky has been cloudy lately but no rain fell. The sea was calm, resembling a river, for which they thanked God. They covered 30 miles or 7-1/2 leagues N.E. after sunrise and another 30 miles during the day heading E.N.E. Later, they sailed E.N.E. for 28 miles or 7 leagues as the wind slowed down. The sailors caught a tunny and a large shark, providing a welcome change from their diet of bread, wine, and yams from the Indies.|"['1.

On this particular night, the sailors had favorable winds and calm seas, allowing them to cover a distance of 29 leagues. Despite the clear view of the North Star, the rolling waves made it challenging for the Admiral to determine their exact location. Throughout the next day, they continued their journey, making a total of 130 miles or 32 leagues. The sky was overcast, hinting that they had not yet reached the Azores. By altering their course to the east, they covered 77 miles or 19-1/4 leagues during the day. As night fell, they maintained their eastward direction, making 55 miles or 13-1/2 leagues. The sailors spotted sandpipers and small sticks, indicating land was nearby. The Admiral and his crew continued their voyage, facing differing opinions on their exact location in relation to the Azores. Despite the discrepancies, they pressed on, eager to see whose calculations would prove to be the most accurate.|['1.

During a stormy night, the sailors aboard the caravel faced strong winds and high seas. The caravel managed to sail 73 miles, encountering bad weather that could have led to disaster if not for skilled navigation. The following day, they struggled through 11 or 12 leagues facing difficulty and danger. In the night, the wind intensified, causing the sea to become turbulent. Despite challenging conditions, they sailed 52 miles. The next night, the wind and waves worsened, making it hard to navigate. The Admiral decided to run before the wind to avoid danger, while another ship, the _Pinta_, sailed out of sight. The crew drew lots for pilgrimages to various shrines, and the Admiral was chosen for one. They continued their journey, facing strong winds and a treacherous sea, making a total of 20 miles that night.|"['1.

The sailors on the ship faced a perilous journey due to the bad weather and lack of ballast. The Admiral had hoped to restock supplies on an island but was now in a dire situation. Despite his fears, he believed in God's mercy. He wrote a detailed account of his discoveries and placed it in a barrel to be thrown into the sea for someone to find and deliver to the Sovereigns. As the storm raged on, the wind shifted, and they spotted land. Some thought it was Madeira, while others believed it to be the rock of Cintra near Lisbon.

The Admiral commanded repairs on the ship and loading of casks for ballast. The port was unsafe, and he considered cutting the cables. Sailing to San Miguel, he faced severe weather without a safe harbor in the Azores. Lacking skilled sailors, he sailed in dangerous conditions. Returning to Santa Maria due to poor visibility, he encountered high winds and a rough sea. The Admiral was surprised by the harsh weather in this region compared to the Indies. Anchoring off Santa Maria, he was approached by locals seeking assurance. The Admiral displayed his authority and documents to secure his crew's release from Portuguese captors. The weather improved, allowing him to find a suitable anchorage for supplies despite rough seas. He sailed towards Castile to avoid the risky southerly gale, covering 111 miles in total.|"['1.

Yesterday, the caravel sailed eastward after sunset at a speed of five miles per hour, covering 65 miles, which is equivalent to 16-1/4 leagues, during the night. From sunrise to sunset, they sailed an additional 16-1/2 leagues under smooth sea conditions. A large bird resembling an eagle visited the caravel during this time. Despite making good progress, they encountered contrary winds and heavy seas, deviating from their course. They found themselves 125 leagues from Cape St. Vincent, 80 from the island of Madeira, and 106 from Santa Maria. As they neared land, a storm hit, damaging their sails. The crew made a vow to fast upon arrival in port. Despite facing a perilous storm, they safely navigated to the rock of Cintra near Lisbon.

"Columbus likely got his information about a new route to the Indies from Marco Polo, not Toscanelli's letter. Columbus summarized Polo's passage in his book before 1492.

Columbus, sailing west of the Canaries, used the Toscanelli map to estimate his position. The map divided distances into 250-mile spaces. Columbus was nine spaces west of the Canaries, but no islands were known to be at this distance. Antilia, as per Behaim's globe, was eight spaces away. Columbus expected to find Cipango (Española) at 12 spaces, but Toscanelli's map placed it at 18 spaces. This discrepancy raises doubts about Columbus' navigation methods. Additionally, Columbus faced mutiny from his crew due to disagreements on the direction to sail. Martin Alonso suggested heading west by south towards Cipango based on Columbus' map.

"In the historical accounts of Christopher Columbus's voyage, Las Casas mentions that if Columbus had continued westward without being influenced by the Castilians, he might have reached Florida and eventually New Spain, facing unprecedented challenges. The word ""Grajaos"" was interpreted differently by translators, with some associating it with Indian birds. Oviedo detailed the sailors' discontent, mentioning a point where they gave Columbus an ultimatum to sail for only three more days. Despite some modern critics questioning Oviedo's narrative, it aligns with other historical records. Columbus's Journal and Peter Martyr also describe the sailors' mutinous behavior, with some plotting to throw Columbus overboard. On the night of October 11th, the moon's position aided in the sighting of land. Columbus later received an award, which some criticized as dishonorable, leading to a sailor's conversion to Islam out of frustration for not receiving a reward. Las Casas noted that Columbus received a lifetime annuity paid from Seville's butcher shops, each maravedi being worth two-thirds of a cent."|"['1.

Christopher Columbus believed he landed on Guanahani, now known as Watling Island. The Portuguese coin _ceitil_ got its name from Ceuta in Africa. A missing line in the text describes Columbus jumping into the sea to swim to a canoe. Columbus referred to maize as _panizo_, meaning panic grass. Columbus called his dogs mastiffs, although they were more like hounds. The _castellano_ was one-sixth of an ounce. The Spanish text mentioned Colba and Bosio, but it should be Cuba and Bohio. Columbus raised anchors at Isabella and headed to Cuba. Columbus saw spheres and world maps depicting the region. Behaim's globe is the only one remaining from that time.

Christopher Columbus had a challenging time navigating based on his interpretations and faulty information. Las Casas pointed out discrepancies in Columbus's understanding of distances and locations. Columbus's reliance on outdated maps and texts led to confusion about the actual locations of islands and cities. For instance, Columbus mistook Cuba for Cipango and misunderstood the native languages and cultures. Additionally, his confusion extended to misidentifying crops like yams and beans.

"One of the earliest references to smoking tobacco dates back to the encounters of the Spanish Christians with indigenous people. The natives were seen carrying a brand and herbs to smoke, a practice they were accustomed to. The process involved dry herbs placed in a leaf, similar to paper muskets made by boys during Easter. The natives would light one end, suck or inhale the smoke, which made them feel drowsy and as if drunk, helping them overcome fatigue. These herbs were called ""tabacos."" Some Spaniards in the island of Española also adopted this habit, finding pleasure or benefits in it despite being cautioned against it. The use of tobacco was further described by Oviedo, mentioning that it was sometimes used as an anesthetic for pain relief."|['1.

"On page 134, note 3, after mentioning the ""Port of Mares,"" Las Casas did not specify the number of degrees in his explanation. This is similar to Columbus's colonial policy detailed in his letter to Ferdinand and Isabella on pages 273-277. The exclusion of foreigners from colonies had both religious and trade monopoly motives. Las Casas also commented on the Admiral's words, noting some imperfections in Castilian. He further described the wax found, speculating it originated from Yucatan. Las Casas added that the canoes were made from fragrant red cedars.

"During his voyage, Columbus named the cape he left in Cuba ""Alpha and Omega,"" meaning beginning and end, as he thought it marked the easternmost point of the Orient. It was common during the Age of Discovery to name new discoveries after saints' days. For example, on December 9 in the harbor of Concepcion, Columbus named an island ""Spanish Isle"" due to its resemblance to Spain. Columbus later believed Española and Cipango were the same, also linking them to the biblical Ophir. The names of fish like ""corbina"" and ""pámpanos"" were applied to American species resembling European ones. Columbus's birth date was deduced by combining his statements about his sea-faring years.

"Christopher Columbus encountered some challenges during his voyages to the New World. One instance was when the seams of his ship opened, but the ship itself was not damaged. Las Casas described these seams as the spaces between planks, not the ribs of the ship. Columbus then hurried to build a stronghold upon arrival, which he named the City of Christmas. Interestingly, Columbus once mentioned seeing mermaids, which were likely manatees mistaken for mythical creatures due to their human-like appearances. Additionally, Columbus referred to the coast of Guinea, where ""maniqueta"" was gathered, likely a reference to the herbaceous plant _Amomum Melequeta_.

"In the historical accounts of Christopher Columbus, there were misunderstandings due to misinterpretations of words. For instance, in a French translation, ""bruma"" meaning ""mist"" was mistaken for ""broma"" which means ""shipworm."" This led to a mistranslation where Columbus's ship was thought to be damaged by frost near Panama in April. Another instance involved the word ""Ciguayos,"" a tribe in Española, who were named so because of their long hair, resembling the fashion of women in Castile. Las Casas, a historian, noted the differences in speech and culture of various tribes in the region. Additionally, there were tales of the culture-hero Guagugiona from the New World, and mentions of Amazon myths in Venezuela, which were a blend of indigenous folklore and classical mythology.

The Admiral believed that there would be no severe storms in the lands he found because mangrove trees grew with roots in the sea. The vegetation on the shore almost touched the waves, a sign that the sea was calm. Ferdinand Columbus recorded his father's words in the Journal, expressing distress over the possibility of his death jeopardizing the success of the voyage. Despite his worries, he penned a message detailing his discoveries, sealed it in a barrel, and tossed it into the sea as a means for the news to reach the King and Queen if he didn't survive. The bonnet sail was a small sail used on ships, and the Portuguese governor was skeptical about Spain's claims of possessions in the Indies. The encounter with Bartolomé Diaz on the ship was likely not the famous Portuguese navigator due to lack of evidence. Portugal and Spain signed the Treaty of Alcaçovas in 1479, relinquishing certain rights along the African coast.|"['Question 1: Why did the Admiral believe there would be no severe storms in the lands he found?\nA) Because of the presence of mangrove trees with roots in the sea\nB) Due to the high vegetation on the shore\nC) The sea was calm and peaceful\nD) The ships were well-equipped to handle storms\nE) The Admiral was an experienced sailor', ""Question 2: What did Ferdinand Columbus do to ensure the news of his discoveries reached the King and Queen in case he didn't survive?\nA) Sent a messenger on horseback\nB) Carried a pigeon with a message\nC) Sealed a message in a barrel and tossed it into the sea\nD) Sent a letter through a carrier pigeon\nE) Recorded a video message"", ""Question 3: What was the purpose of the bonnet sail mentioned in the text?\nA) To protect the ship from storms\nB) To increase the ship's speed\nC) To provide shade for the crew\nD) To navigate through shallow waters\nE) To signal other ships"", ""Question 4: Why was the Portuguese governor skeptical about Spain's claims of possessions in the Indies?\nA) Lack of evidence\nB) Political rivalry\nC) Personal grudge\nD) Miscommunication\nE) Fear of losing power"", 'Question 5: What did Portugal and Spain agree upon in the Treaty of Alcaçovas in 1479?\nA) Sharing territories in the Americas\nB) Relinquishing rights along the African coast\nC) Establishing a new trade route\nD) Forming a military alliance\nE) Exchanging prisoners of war', ""Question 6: Why did Ferdinand Columbus express distress over the possibility of his death jeopardizing the success of the voyage?\nA) He was afraid of storms\nB) He doubted the crew's abilities\nC) He worried about the news reaching the King and Queen\nD) He feared the Admiral's leadership\nE) He felt responsible for the voyage's outcome""]"|"['A) Because of the presence of mangrove trees with roots in the sea', 'C) Sealed a message in a barrel and tossed it into the sea', ""B) To increase the ship's speed"", 'A) Lack of evidence', 'B) Relinquishing rights along the African coast', ""E) He felt responsible for the voyage's outcome""]"
The historian Ruide Pina, in his book about King João, witnessed Columbus meeting the king in 1493. Columbus had returned from discovering Cipango and Antilia under Castile's command. The king, initially upset, showed kindness towards Columbus despite being advised to have him killed. Columbus was accused of exaggerating his findings, and the king felt he trespassed on Guinea's territory. Columbus was called Admiral and was honored by the king. Columbus mentioned discovering Cipango and Antilia, mythical islands. The king gave Columbus's pilot a sum similar to what John Cabot received from Henry VII. Columbus's letter about his voyage was published in Barcelona in April 1493, addressed to Luis de Santangel, who supported Columbus's project. The letter was also sent to Gabriel Sanxis and later translated into Latin.|"[""1.

After writing a letter while sailing in the sea near Castile, strong winds blew from the South and South-east, forcing me to lighten the ships. I sought refuge in Lisbon today, a remarkable port, to inform their Highnesses. Despite experiencing delays due to storms in this sea, the climate in the Indies has been consistently pleasant. Seamen here claim this winter has been exceptionally harsh with numerous shipwrecks. Historical estimates vary greatly regarding the population of Española during colonization. Marco Polo once mentioned men with tails in Sumatra. Columbus, influenced by various writers, had misconceptions about the New World. The return voyage duration is calculated from the last island departed to the first island reached.

In the kingdom of Aragon, the _Escrivano de Racion_ oversaw the king's expenses, while in Castile, the _contador mayor_ managed audits. The document suggests settling two thousand people on the Spanish Island for safety and trade benefits. Settlers could only mine gold with permission, ensuring honesty and church funding. A treasurer would manage gold for the crown. Vessels were to unload at specific ports, with strict records. Gold would be kept in a chest with two keys for transparency.

The letter written by Columbus in 1493 was a crucial step in forming a colonial policy for the newly discovered islands. It contained suggestions that were later included in the instructions given to Columbus for his second voyage on May 29, 1493. This letter, along with a memorandum sent by Columbus in 1494, established him as not only the discoverer but also the pioneer lawgiver of the New World. The Sovereigns appointed Gomez Tello to accompany Columbus on the second voyage to manage royal dues, indicating the significance of Columbus's early letters. The development of fiscal and commercial regulations in Spanish colonial administration is detailed in historical works by Bourne and Moses. The formal signature used by Columbus in his deeds in 1498 remains a mystery, with various interpretations discussed by scholars.

I will end my story here. Some may think I have exaggerated, but I assure you, every word is true. There was an island where Diego Marquez and his team found aromatic plants, birds, and rivers. They got lost but returned on November 8. The natives, known as Taynos, not Caribs, claimed nobility. The bones found were likely of important people, not those they ate. There is no record of this exploration, but it seems to have taken place around December 20, after Antonio de Torres sailed for Spain.|['1.

"About three months after the fleet departed from Spain on September 25, 1493, Christopher Columbus arrived at his destination. The exact landing date is not mentioned in historical accounts like the _Historie_ or by Las Casas. In a letter known as the Syllacio-Coma letter, the landing date is described as ""eight days from Christmas."" The term _cosas introfatibles_ in Spanish, which is translated from a French version, appears to be corrupted. It is suggested that the correct term might be _cosas corruptibles_. Dr. Chanca's letter mentions a city named Isabela, which is said to have been named after Queen Isabela by Columbus himself. The silk-cotton tree, possibly the _Eriodendron anfractuosum_, is also known as the cotton plant and was a significant source of cotton in the Middle Ages.

The account of Columbus's third voyage, where he discovered South America, is from Las Casas' _Historia de las Indias_. Las Casas used Columbus's papers to compile this history, including a condensed version of the journal from the third voyage. The translation by John Boyd Thacher in _Christopher Columbus_ is based on Cesare de Lollis' critical text, which omitted some of Las Casas' comments. Columbus described this voyage in a letter to Ferdinand and Isabella, included in Major's _Select Letters of Columbus_ and P.L. Ford's _Writings of Columbus_. Other contemporary accounts are in Ferdinand Columbus's _Historie_, Peter Martyr's _De Rebus Oceanicis_, and letters by Simone Verde and Angelo Trivigiano. Columbus set sail from San Lucar de Barrameda on May 30, 1498, with six ships, facing challenges due to financial struggles and rumors of a French fleet waiting to capture him.|"[""1.

The Admiral, before setting sail, provided clear instructions to the captains. He directed that each week, a new captain would take charge of the fleet, overseeing navigation and the placement of the night lantern. The journey began heading west-southwest for 850 leagues, aiming to reach Dominica. From there, the course would shift to west-northwest towards the island of Sant Juan, then onward to New Isabella, known today as Santo Domingo. Specific landmarks and islands were highlighted as waypoints, emphasizing peaceful trade with the natives over forceful actions. The Admiral expressed his faith in the Holy Trinity, embarking on a voyage towards uncharted territories. After stocking up on provisions, including cheese, the fleet departed towards the Canary Islands. The Admiral, accompanied by one ship and two caravels, sailed towards the Cape Verde Islands, while the other ships were sent back. The narrative also touched upon the Admiral's illness and the political agreements concerning navigational boundaries. Upon reaching the Cape Verde Islands, the Admiral found them arid and not as their name suggested. The expedition encountered a leper colony seeking the curative properties of turtles found on the island. The Admiral's interactions with locals and preparations for the journey ahead were also detailed.|['1.

In Buenavista, a laborious life is led by six or seven healthy residents. They rely on brackish well water and their job is to hunt big goats, salt their skins, and send them to Portugal on caravels that visit the island. The skins are so valuable that they fetch 2000 ducats. The island is home to a multitude of goats, descendants of just eight originals. These residents eat only goat flesh, fish, or turtles for several months each year. The Admiral, seeking new lands, faced intense heat and a sudden lack of wind on his journey. He persevered, hoping to find moderation in temperature to continue his exploration. Despite challenges, he remains determined to serve God, the Sovereigns, and Christianity.|['1.

"On Thursday, July 19, the weather was scorching, and the men and ships were in danger of burning. However, after enduring this intense heat for seven to eight days, they were relieved by good weather. They sailed westward for 17 days, hoping to find land to the north of Española. On Sunday, July 22, they saw countless birds flying from the west-south-west to the north-east, a sign of land. Despite not sighting land immediately, they continued their journey towards the west. On Tuesday, July 31, due to a lack of water, they changed course to the west, and a sailor named Alonso Pérez spotted land to the west, naming it ""The Island of the Trinity."" This discovery filled them with gratitude and songs of praise. They then sailed towards the coast, finding a beautiful, cultivated land with groves and palms, thanking the Holy Trinity for their blessings."|['1.

"He mentions that he set out to find a safe harbor near Trinidad Island on Thursday, August 2. Upon reaching the island's cape, which he named ""Punta del Arenal,"" he unknowingly entered the perilous ""de la Ballena"" gulf. The gulf is treacherous due to the strong Yuyapari river flowing into it. The Admiral encountered natives in canoes, mistaking their gestures for hostility when they saw the ship's crew dancing. A local chief adorned the Admiral with a golden diadem, exchanging headwear as a sign of goodwill. The indigenous people were well-built, armed with bows and arrows, and wore colorful cotton garments. They were fairer and taller than other natives, with long, smooth hair styled like those in Castile. The Admiral noted the high temperatures, lush vegetation, and strong currents between Trinidad and Sancta islands.

In a new land, the explorers found vast oysters, infinite fish, and parrots larger than hens. The parrots on the mainland were bigger and green, with lighter shades compared to those on the islands. The mainland parrots had yellow and red spots on their wings, while island parrots had red necks with spots. The parrots of Española had white backs, those of Cuba had red backs, and the parrots of San Juan were similar to those of Española. The mainland also had unique parrots, large and colorful but not able to speak. The Admiral encountered dangerous currents near the Boca de la Sierpe while navigating the strait between Trinidad and the mainland. The expedition continued towards the Isla de Gracia, a high landmass surrounded by trees reaching the sea, mistaken for an island.

In August, the Admiral encountered indigenous people in the New World. The natives, with long hair and fine stature, wore minimal clothing. They were given gifts and welcomed warmly. The Admiral observed their customs and the vibrant colors of their clothing. The indigenous people brought food and beverages, some resembling wine, made from maize. They also presented handwoven cotton handkerchiefs and parrots. The Admiral desired to take some natives with him but could not. He later chose six men to accompany him on his ship.

Upon reaching Aguja, the explorer spotted another large island to the south, named Sabeta, and yet another to the west. These islands, though seemingly distinct due to inlets and valleys, were likely connected to the mainland. The explorer, thinking he was within a gulf, encountered many canoes full of people, some adorned with gold. Despite their offerings, he declined, finding the gold to be of poor quality. The locals mentioned other islands with abundant gold, but warned of cannibals. The explorer was intrigued by pearls and gold ornaments traded by the natives, who were hospitable and generous. The explorer was impressed by the beauty and population of the region, calling it Paria. He then sailed westward, believing the mainland to be an island, and encountered more islands rich in resources, but had to return due to time constraints.|"['1.

The Admiral believed that the pearls were born in oysters from the dew that fell while they were open, due to the calm sea where the trees entered the water. He found a gulf, named Golpho de las Perlas, with four openings leading to rivers. Despite the belief that there were no rivers, the Admiral encountered rivers flowing into the gulf. Eager to explore further, he was hindered by the loss of supplies needed for the people in Española. To secure more aid and supplies, he set sail for the island of Española, leaving behind the mysteries of the gulf. The Admiral expressed his deep desire for the Sovereigns to explore and gain these new lands, ensuring a revenue that would leave a lasting legacy. His ultimate goal was to serve the Holy Trinity and see Christianity flourish in these new territories.|"['1.

On Monday, August 13, the sailor raised the anchor under the moonlight and set sail towards Cape of Lapa, also known as Paria. His goal was to head north through the treacherous passage called Del Drago. This strait, known as the Mouth of the Dragon, lay between the Point of Lapa and Cape Boto. The sailor described a fierce battle between the fresh and salt water currents, creating a roaring and tumultuous sea. Despite the danger, they managed to navigate through the turbulent waters and reach safety. Continuing their journey, they explored various islands and capes, naming them along the way. As night fell, they spotted more islands, including La Isla de la Asuncion and La Concepcion. The sailor's vigilant watch over the sea led them to Margarita Island, where he observed the beauty of the coast and the abundance of pearls in the region.|"[""1.

The Admiral seems to have sailed down the coast after leaving the Mouth of the Dragon on Monday and Tuesday, covering about 30 to 40 leagues. He observed that the land to the west was vast, level, and beautiful, realizing it was not an island but a mainland. He believed this based on the great river and fresh-water sea he encountered. The Admiral expressed his desire to return to Española quickly due to concerns about the disorder there and the need to send ships to continue exploring the mainland. He also worried about supplies spoiling and being lost, as he had obtained them with great difficulty. Despite his Christian purpose and contentment, he felt unappreciated for his efforts and feared the decline in the importance of the discoveries. He decided to head back to Española due to tired crew members, unsuitable ships for further exploration, and his own failing health.|"['1.

"Christopher Columbus continued his journey, facing various challenges and making discoveries. He mentioned different plants and products he encountered, such as cinnamon, aloes, and ginger, although he did not recognize some of them on the island. He described a type of plant called ""cabuya,"" similar to flax, which could be used to make cloth. Columbus also noted the absence of certain items like incense on the islands. Eventually, he reached a small island named Madama Beata, close to Española, where he anchored and sent boats to communicate his arrival to the Adelantado. The Adelantado, expecting Columbus, set out in a caravel to meet him, and they were pleased to reunite. Columbus then faced difficulties navigating through currents and contrary winds before finally arriving back at the port of Sancto Domingo after a long journey."|['1.

Bartholomew Columbus held the title of Adelantado, a position given to military and political governors of border provinces in Spain. This title was carried over to America during earlier times. Juan Antonio Columbo, a first cousin of the admiral, retained his family name in Spain, unlike Christopher Columbus who changed his name to Colon. Columbus's knowledge of the Gargades islands was indirectly derived from Pliny's work through Cardinal d'Ailly's _Imago Mundi_. Pliny's location of the Hesperides possibly referred to the Cape Verde Islands. In August 1494, the sovereigns included the essential articles of the Treaty of Tordesillas in a letter to Columbus, asking for his help in locating the Demarcation Line. Columbus fell ill in September 1494, taking five months to recover fully. The scientific conference to locate the line did not occur until the one in Badajoz in 1524.|"['1.

"In 1497, Rodrigo Affonso, a member of the king's council, was granted land in São Thiago and cattle in Boavista. The term ""mayordomo"" translates to ""steward"" but originally meant a high Portuguese title, similar to a mayor of the palace. ""Escribano de la hacienda del Rey"" refers to the king's treasurer.

King John of Portugal wanted the Demarcation Line moved west, potentially influencing Cabral's discovery of Brazil and Vasco da Gama's South Atlantic exploration.

"The discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus in 1492 marked a significant turning point in history. Columbus believed he had found a new land, not just a western route to Asia. This discovery had a profound impact on Christianity, leading to a steady expansion of its influence globally. Despite Columbus's exaggerated claims about the exploration of Africa's west coast, his voyage to the Americas remains a pivotal moment in world history. The phrase ""another world"" used by Columbus in his letters to the Spanish monarchs highlighted the magnitude of his discovery. The exploration of the Orinoco River mouths and the Gulf of Paria by sailors added to the understanding of the newly found lands. Columbus's realization that he had reached an unknown part of the world, distinct from Asia, changed the course of history and opened up new possibilities for exploration and trade."|"[""1.

On April 10, 1495, the rulers permitted separate exploring journeys. Columbus complained that these journeys violated his rights. Consequently, on June 2, 1497, the rulers revised their decree and prohibited any violations. Las Casas may have been mistaken in saying the consent had not been withdrawn in 1498. The independent voyages of Hojeda and Pinzon, who first explored the northern coast of South America (Paria) in 1499-1500, might have led him to believe that the authorization had not been revoked. The horizon circle, depicted by the compass card, was imagined to be divided into eight winds and each wind into halves and quarters. The quarters corresponded to the modern compass points, totaling thirty-two. The observed declination was two compass points, or 22° 30'. Columbus's letter to Doña Juana de Torres, written in 1500, reveals distress and self-defense. It is a crucial document for understanding his career and character.|"['1.

If I had taken the Indies or the lands nearby from the altar of Saint Peter and given them to the Moors, they could not have shown greater enmity towards me in Spain. It's hard to believe because there was always so much magnanimity. I wanted to free myself from this affair if it had been honorable towards my Queen. The support of Our Lord and Her Highness made me persevere. To alleviate some of the sorrows caused by death, I undertook a new voyage to the new lands that had been hidden. This voyage to Paria was meant to appease them with pearls and the discovery of gold in Española. The Indians in Española revolted against me, and Hojeda arrived with promises and caused trouble. Adrian tried to rise in rebellion again, but his evil purpose did not succeed. I had been prepared to return to their Highnesses with good news of gold after six months. I begged them to send someone to take charge of justice, but they did the opposite of what was needed. Their Highnesses should remove the grounds of common saying that the calumny of the people has done me more harm than good service.|['1.

When I heard this, I thought that this matter would be similar to others, but I held back when I learned for sure from the friars that their Highnesses had sent him. I wrote to welcome his arrival, saying I was ready to go to the Court and had sold all I owned at auction. I assured him not to rush with the immunities, as I would hand over that matter and the government to him smoothly. I also informed the friars, but neither he nor they replied. Instead, he took a hostile stance, making everyone swear allegiance to him as Governor. He granted excessive immunities to undeserving individuals, causing unrest. I tried to rectify the situation by asserting my own authority, but he instigated conflict against me.

I have already mentioned that I wrote to him and the friars, then set off almost by myself, as all were with the Adelantado, to avoid suspicion.

I had saved large gold pieces to show the monarchs, but they were given away to devalue their importance. The Commander unjustly accuses me of owing a large sum. I wish an inquisitor had been sent earlier to clear my name. I should be judged as a captain exploring new lands, not by laws unsuited to the Indies.

I believe that my mistakes were not made intentionally to harm anyone, and I trust that their Majesties understand this. I have seen how mercifully they treat even those who try to harm them. I am sure that their kindness towards me, their loyal servant, will be even greater, especially since I erred unknowingly and due to circumstances beyond my control. They will surely recognize the value of my services and see how beneficial they are. If they decide to have someone else judge me, I ask them to send two fair individuals to the Indies at my expense, who I believe can easily find five marks of gold in four hours now that it has been discovered. It is crucial for them to address this matter. The Commander, upon his arrival in Santo Domingo, took over my house and claimed everything for himself, which I accept without complaint.

A letter from Don Christóbal Colon, Viceroy and Admiral of the Indies, to the King and Queen of Spain, details his voyage from Cadiz to the Canary Islands and then to the Indies. He expresses his intention to expedite the journey to Jamaica, where he was headed. Despite experiencing excellent weather initially, a dreadful tempest struck on his arrival in Dominica and continued as he reached Española. Colon requested a ship replacement due to unseaworthy vessels. A severe storm separated the ships, causing distress and loss, but they were eventually reunited. After enduring an 88-day tempest, Colon finally found calm seas and fair winds, reaching the Cape of Gracias á Dios. Despite challenges, Colon's son and crew displayed resilience.

All that I have mentioned is based on what I heard from others. Specifically, I recall sailing twenty-four degrees west in nine hours in the year ninety-four. This is a fact as it coincided with a solar eclipse, with the sun in Libra and the moon in Aries. The information I gathered orally was already in books. Ptolemy believed he corrected Marinus accurately, but it seems Marinus was very close to the truth. Ptolemy situated Catigara twelve lines west of his meridian, which he placed at two degrees and a third past Cape St. Vincent in Portugal. Marinus described the earth and its boundaries in fifteen lines. Marinus mentioned Ethiopia as extending over twenty-four degrees beyond the equator, a fact confirmed by Portuguese explorations. Ptolemy indicated the southernmost land to be the primary boundary, not going beyond fifteen degrees and a third. The world is relatively small, with six-sevenths being land and the remaining covered by water. Experience and references to the Holy Scripture support this. The equatorial line measures fifty-six miles and two-thirds per degree. My focus is on recounting my challenging voyage, notably the most honorable and beneficial of all. On the eve of St. Simon and St. Jude, I sailed uncontrollably due to strong winds, eventually finding refuge for ten days. Initially, I was pushed back by storms and strong currents, forcing me to seek shelter in Bastimentos harbor, despite my reluctance|['1.

On the sixth of February, during the rain, I directed seventy men to explore inland. They discovered mines five leagues away. Guided by local Indians, they reached a tall mountain where they were shown the gold-rich land. The Indians mentioned gold scattered throughout the region and extensive mines to the west, taking twenty days to reach. They also described towns with varying gold deposits. Later, I found out that the Quibian, who lent these Indians, had them lead to distant mines, belonging to his enemy. In his territory, one could gather gold in ten days. Bringing Indian witnesses, we sailed to the Indians' dwellings. After four hours, my brother returned with guides, all carrying gold they had collected. The abundance and quality of gold surprised the men, many being seamen and youths. I established a settlement with ample building materials and gifted the Quibian to maintain peace. However, tensions arose as the natives were rough, and the Spaniards were aggressive. The Quibian attempted to burn our settlement and kill us but was captured along with his family. Despite a short captivity, he managed to escape. In January, the river mouth closed, and by April, the shipworms severely damaged our vessels. I struggled to save three ships as the river created an outlet. While fetching water, the Indians attacked the boats, resulting in a massacre. Alone on the treacherous coast, exhausted and feverish, I cried out for help, falling asleep. In a|"['1.

With only two ships left, in a state of disrepair, I set sail towards safety. Battling storms and treacherous seas, we eventually reached the province of Mago.

There is a reliable mode of navigation derived from astronomy that acts as a trustworthy guide for those who comprehend it. This method is akin to having a vision of the future. Ships traveling to the Indies must sail with the wind behind them due to the strong currents in the region. Waiting for a favorable breeze is common, sometimes for several months. Upon reaching Cariay, enchanters tried to lure the voyagers with young girls carrying magic powder. The land is inhabited by various animals, including large fowls, lions, stags, and fallow-deer. The discovery of the Indies revealed vast riches in gold, pearls, spices, and precious stones. The land of Veragua showed more signs of gold in two days than Española did in four years. The area is fertile, well-cultivated, and harbors a river, making it easily defensible.|"['1.

I refrained from speaking about certain matters for reasons previously explained. I do not claim to have always spoken or written with absolute certainty, nor do I claim to possess ultimate knowledge. Gold holds great value, being treasured worldwide for its power to fulfill desires and aid in spiritual salvation. The Genoese and Venetians travel far to exchange pearls and precious stones for this precious metal. Solomon used large quantities of gold to create magnificent objects, as recounted by Josephus. The mines of Veragua are said to hold vast amounts of gold, potentially the same as the Aurea mines. Solomon's wealth, including gold and precious stones, could be obtained by your Majesties. It is believed that Christians will rebuild Jerusalem and Mount Sion, as prophesied. The Abbot Joaquim suggested that the one to accomplish this task would come from Spain. The emperor of Cathay sought knowledge of Christianity from wise men. The people who sailed with me have endured hardships, and I urge your Highnesses to reward them justly. I aim to complete my voyage in one month, trusting in God for success. I had planned to build ships differently but lacked time.

From the Queen's Garden, Columbus sailed south on July 27. After ninety leagues, he spotted an island on Saturday, July 30, which turned out to be Guanaja, located about twelve leagues north of Trujillo, Honduras. Upon landing, they encountered well-clothed Indians in a canoe carrying merchandise. Despite signs of advanced culture, Columbus chose not to explore further, aiming to find a strait he believed separated Asia from the continent he discovered on his third voyage. He reached the mainland near Trujillo, naming a point Caxinas, and landed there on Sunday, August 14. Sailing slowly along the coast, facing storms and headwinds, Columbus finally reached Cape Gracias á Dios on September 12. The accounts of this journey vary, with discrepancies in timings and distances, likely due to errors in copying or memory lapses.|"['1.

"Their journey led them along the Mosquito coast towards Cariay, situated near the mouth of Nicaragua's San Juan River. Accounts vary on the exact date of their arrival at Cariarí, with discrepancies in the name as well. Columbus referred to the region as Ciamba, which the locals called Quiriquetana, a name possibly preserved in the Chiriqui Lagoon near Almirante Bay. The name ""Ciamba"" is also found on Martin Behaim's globe of 1492, corresponding to Cochin-China. Carambaru, identified as Almirante Bay today, lies on the border of Costa Rica and Panama, described as a bay with many islands and coves. Veragua, encompassing much of present-day Panama, was granted to Luis Colon in 1537, leading to the title Dukes of Veragua held by Columbus's descendants. Columbus's journey continued to various places like Guaigo, Cateva, and Beragua, covering a distance of fifty leagues from Cerabora to Cubiga, culminating in his arrival at Puerto Bello on November 2."|['1.

Ciguare, a province of the Mayas in southern Costa Rica, was mentioned by Peter Martyr as having two districts named Taia and Maia. The Italian translation of Columbus's letter in 1505 provided Europe with its first insights into Mayan culture, despite Columbus's misinterpretations. Columbus believed he had sailed 9/24 around the world on the 24th parallel, using an eclipse to determine the time difference between Europe and his location. He thought he had reached Asia, but in reality, he was far from it due to inaccurate calculations. Marinus of Tyre's division of the earth into 24 meridians influenced Columbus's beliefs, leading him to think he had reached India or China. However, his strong preconceptions distorted his calculations. Columbus's voyage is illustrated in a map by Bartholomew Columbus, showing his ideas and conclusions about the region, which he believed was connected to South America.|"['1.

In ancient times, explorers like Columbus used different measurements to understand the world. For example, Columbus learned about the length of a degree on the equator from Arab astronomer Alfragan. Alfragan estimated it to be about 56-2/3 miles, while Ptolemy, an ancient geographer, thought it was longer at 62-1/2 miles. Columbus was fascinated by these measurements and studied them in texts like the _Imago Mundi_. Additionally, Columbus was intrigued by the southernmost point of the world, which Ptolemy believed to be the promontory of Prasum, located around 16 degrees south latitude. These historical measurements and explorations helped shape our understanding of geography and the world we live in today.|['1.

Columbus departed from Porto Bello on November 9 and sailed eight leagues. However, the following day, he turned back four leagues and sought refuge at what is now known as Nombre de Dios. Due to the abundance of maize fields, he named it Port of Provisions (Puerto de Bastimentos). They stayed at Bastimentos until November 23, then proceeded to Guiga but quickly moved on to a small harbor on November 26, which Columbus named Retrete (Closet) because of its size. This harbor could only accommodate five or six vessels, with an entrance just fifteen to twenty paces wide. The repair of the ship _Gallega_ took place between December 26 and January 3 in a location between Rio de los Lagartos and Puerto Bello.|['1.

During his time confined in the River Belem, Columbus had his brother explore the area. The potential for a successful settlement prompted him to establish a small community and make plans to return to Spain for reinforcements and supplies. This marked the first attempt at a settlement on the American Continent. Unfortunately, due to the aggression of the indigenous people, the project had to be abandoned. The hostility culminated in an attack that made it impossible to proceed. The manuscript of Las Casas's _Historia de las Indias_ notes that this settlement, despite its brief existence, was the first Spanish attempt on the mainland. Ferdinand Columbus detailed the course taken by his father, the Admiral, along the isthmus eastward beyond El Retrete to a place named Marmoro, eventually leading to the discovery and landing in Cuba. Columbus was convinced that Cuba was part of the Asian mainland, even naming it Mago.|"['1.

In 1499-1502, explorers like Vicente Yañez Pinzon, Hojeda, Diego de Lepe, and Rodrigo de Bastidas embarked on significant voyages. The age of Columbus is a topic of debate, with various scholars suggesting different birth years. John Cabot, a Venetian sailor, took the first English ship across the Atlantic. Our knowledge of his endeavors comes from reports of others who knew him or his son. Conflicting testimonies have led to doubts about Sebastian Cabot's credibility. Some believe he tried to claim his father's achievements. References to these explorations and the Cabot controversy can be found in several historical works, including those by Harrisse and Weare. The most recent detailed study is by Biggar in the _Revue Hispanique_. A Venetian sailor, possibly Cabot, has reported the discovery of new lands, sparking interest and approval from the King.|"['1.

"This letter, housed in the Archivio di Stato in Milan, was first published in the _Annuario Scientifico del 1865_ (Milan, 1866). It made its English debut in Winsor's _Narrative and Critical History of America_, III. 54-55 (Boston, 1884), within Charles Deane's chapter ""The Voyages of the Cabots."" Professor B.H. Nash from Harvard University revised this translation with only minor adjustments. The meaning of a specific sentence in the letter remains unclear. Bellemo, in the _Raccolta Colombiana_, interprets this sentence as Cabot showcasing his voyage's location on a globe, surpassing the land of the Tanais. Tanais refers to the Don River, where the Venetian trading post La Tana was situated. Biggar, in _Voyages of the Cabots and Corte-Reals_, disagrees with this interpretation. It is possible that ""the land of the Tanais"" refers to the powerful kingdom of Tana described by Marco Polo. This kingdom, located in India, had extensive trade. The term ""toward the East"" indicates the ultimate destination, often associated with the known spot in Europe known as ""the East.""

"The English word ""stockfish"" is an Italianized term. The fish trade between England and Iceland is detailed by Biggar in the ""Voyages of the Cabots,"" referencing G.W. Dasent's ""Icelandic Annals."" Cabot mistakenly associated Marco Polo's Cipango with the Spice Islands due to Columbus's reports of discovering Cipango and spice-producing islands. Jiddah on the Red Sea's east shore replaced Aden as a spice trade hub from 1425, where goods were transferred to Egyptian vessels. Jiddah, the entry port for Mecca, became a major spice market. Despite some spices arriving overland, most came by sea to Jiddah, providing accurate information on their origins. In the fifteenth century, English social customs differed from those of refined Italians, as noted by Raimondo de Soncino and Vespasiano's account on Poggio's experiences in England."|"['1.
