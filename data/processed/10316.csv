Our troop was loaned a houseboat for the summer by a local man. We planned to fix it up and use it to go to Temple Camp. The boat was square and lacked power, making it hard to maneuver. While inspecting the boat, a ragged man jumped out and ran off, leaving us puzzled. As we worked on the boat, we discovered a locked locker. Despite our curiosity, we didn't open it. Eventually, we faced the challenge of moving the boat to Catskill Landing on the Hudson River to reach Temple Camp. Temple Camp is a scout camp by Black Lake, managed by Jeb Rushmore, a former trapper. Our scoutmaster, Mr. Ellsworth, urged us to focus on the boat.

We were figuring out how to reach camp without much money in our troop. Towing was pricey, and an engine would cost a lot. But Mr. Ellsworth said good deeds are like good investments, paying back in fun. One day, an angry tugboat captain needed the bridge opened. We found an old key-bar and helped him through. The captain then offered to tow us up to Poughkeepsie as a thank you. Despite his gruff exterior, we had a blast with him. The troop gathered for the trip, including Skinny McCord, a new member from a poor family. We helped him join the Elk Patrol, showing that kindness goes a long way.|"[""1.

Before Saturday, Mr. Ellsworth made a deal with Sandy Grober to tow us down to Kill Von Kull near Staten Island. Sandy, who has a boat with a strong motor, agreed to do it for ten dollars. Since our troop was short on cash for food and supplies, Mr. Ellsworth paid Sandy the ten dollars upfront. Each patrol leader then promised to repay Mr. Ellsworth $2.50 once they earned it, totaling $7.50. Mr. Ellsworth covered the remaining $2.50. We set off early Saturday morning, following Captain Savage's instructions to wait near St. George until he arrived. The journey down the river was uneventful. We arrived at St. George around six in the evening, surrounded by impressive boats. Sandy left to fish, and the scouts planned to explore St. George while I stayed back to update the troop book as the historian.|['1.

"Soon after, I heard the distinct sound of oars hitting the water, growing louder as the boat approached. I recognized it as the first group returning. It felt too soon for their return, and the silence was odd, especially if it was the lively Raven Patrol, led by Pee-wee Harris. The absence of their usual chatter was unusual. If it was the Elk Patrol, I would have heard Bert McAlpin, known for his constant talking. As the boat neared, I noticed a solitary figure rowing towards the house-boat. The only sound was the rhythmic splash of the oars, which struck me as peculiar. The boat eventually reached us, and a quiet ""_Pst_"" caught my attention. Peering over the rail, I saw a scruffy figure in a rowboat. Despite his rough appearance, he greeted me warmly and assured me he meant no harm. His infectious laugh echoed as he perched on the railing, sharing a secret plan with me."|['1.

He continued his tale with enthusiasm, sharing how he unexpectedly met his adventurous friend, Jake Holden, and embarked on a spontaneous fishing trip down the bay. Despite being in his uniform, he followed Jake's lead to get some old fishing clothes from his dad's houseboat in the marshes. Ignoring regulations, he swapped his uniform for greasy rags and joined Jake on the water. As he recounted his escapades, he revealed that what was meant to be a quick trip turned into a week-long adventure filled with thrilling escapes and sea-worthy tales, reminiscent of Robinson Crusoe's adventures.

Around the campfire one night, a man named Mike Corby shared an adventurous fishing tale. He and his friend had a successful day fishing near Sea Gate, earning about seventy dollars. However, they got lost at sea for three days before being rescued by a fishing schooner. Mike had to disguise his identity, fearing the consequences of his delayed return to camp. He even pretended to be someone else when contacting his hometown to gather information about his troop's whereabouts.

It was Pee-wee Harris that the lieutenant heard talking while he was hiding on shore. Pee-wee was the first voice I heard when they were returning. Voices carry well over water. By the time they were halfway out, I knew all about the bandit of Red Hallow. This bandit saved a school teacher from twenty others and shot them all. It was like a scene from a movie, with everyone shooting pistols. Pee-wee defended the teacher, which was amusing since he usually gets in trouble for talking in class. I prefer adventures like stalking rather than shooting. When Mr. Ellsworth came aboard, he joked about the movie and the boys meeting real bandits. They all agreed it was crazy. Later, I read an article about two fishermen's harrowing adventure at sea. They were rescued after drifting for three days in a storm.|"['1.

When a journalist tried to locate the two men mentioned in the article to confirm the story, they were nowhere to be found. It was reported that both men carried a significant amount of money due to the large fish catches they sold during their fishing expedition. The boat, in which one of the men continued his journey after repairs, did not have a license number, making it difficult to trace them. This mysterious disappearance sparked curiosity and speculation about the adventures the men might have had, beyond what Lieutenant Donnelle had disclosed. The following day, during a troop activity, a discovery of misplaced coins led to a small mystery that was eventually solved, highlighting the importance of honesty and observance.|"[""1.

"I explained, ""Merit badges are for special skills, things not everyone can do. They're not for simple stuff like keeping your eyes open or being honest. That's expected of everyone. Instead, badges are earned for things like tracking animals or learning new skills. For instance, the stalking badge is about observing nature and moving quietly. It's a fun way to learn. Focus on one badge at a time, like stalking, and avoid talking about irrelevant things. Concentrate on improving your observation skills.

"Golly, I never interfere when a patrol is initiating a tenderfoot. That's one thing I don't do. I wouldn't even share this, but Pee-wee mentioned its significant impact.

One night, I couldn't sleep, so I went outside to the deck. Sitting on a big chair, I gazed at the dark sea lit by boat lights. Suddenly, a face with disheveled hair startled me. The person wanted to stay near me, unable to sleep due to overthinking. Advising him to rest, I suggested trying for a swimming badge. I noticed his ill-fitting suit and skinny legs, feeling sorry for him. Unlike others with many badges, he was fixated on one thing, intense and unable to focus on various tasks. He might be a genius or a bit crazy, but his singular dedication intrigued me.|"[""1.

I was thrilled that he was going for the swimming badge, and I hoped the Elks would support him. Having Hunt Ward, the troop's best swimmer, to help him was a big advantage. It's important to aim for the swimming badge early on when you join a troop, even if you can't earn it until passing your first class tests. Every guy should know how to swim, that's for sure. The next morning, the _General Grant_ (Captain Savage's tug) sailed towards us. We cheered as it approached, and Captain Savage, standing in the small house, joked with us. He teased us about being in shallow water and made us work quickly to secure the ropes. We sailed alongside the tug, and most of us spent time on it, exploring and watching Captain Savage steer. He was kind to us and even treated us to sodas in Peekskill. Captain Savage was a fun and friendly guide on our journey.|"[""1.

We had Captain Savage join us for lunch on the house-boat, and Mr. Ellsworth thanked him with a speech. When the tugboat started down the river, we cheered Captain Savage from the cabin roof. Despite a few setbacks, we made it to Catskill Landing. Our return journey promises more adventures, as Mr. Ellsworth arranged for a steam yacht to tow us back. We spent two days in Poughkeepsie, teaching Skinny to swim. The Elks helped him learn the strokes while we cheered him on. Skinny, determined and enthusiastic, quickly picked up swimming. He even attempted to swim across the river, eager to earn his badge. Later, he entertained us by diving off the deck, making quite the splash and keeping us all laughing.|['1.

We all knew that the kid would ace the swimming badge, but the real challenge was reining him in. And we were spot on because as soon as he climbed onto the cabin roof to dry off, he unexpectedly dashed to the edge and dove in before Mr. Ellsworth could stop him. It was a risky dive for a beginner; hitting the water wrong could have been disastrous. Hunt Ward had to jump in and swim to catch him. Later, Mr. Ellsworth lectured Skinny about following instructions. Skinny was more focused on the badge as a fashion statement than on learning scouting skills. The Elks were hurrying him through, collecting badges without truly understanding the scouting values. It's important to grasp the essence of scouting rather than just collecting badges.|"['1.

Grove encouraged Pee-wee to throw a jawbreaker to Skinny, but Pee-wee seemed to have run out. Skinny, determined to prove himself, dived into the water to retrieve the candy. However, Mr. Ellsworth, the scout leader, reprimanded Skinny for disobeying orders and lying about the candy. Skinny, disappointed and on the verge of tears, threw the jawbreaker into the water. The incident highlighted the importance of obedience and honesty in scouting. Despite feeling sorry for Skinny, it was a lesson learned for everyone involved. It's essential to follow instructions and be truthful, qualities that define a true scout.|"['1.

When I first thought about going to talk to Skinny and tell him how amazing he was, Mr. Ellsworth also recognized it. But then I decided against it because of Connie. Besides, I didn't have the right to spoil what our scoutmaster had said, did I? I wouldn't say anything negative about the Elks, they're great scouts, but they're really into stunts. They have more merit badges than the Ravens and Silver Foxes combined. Hunt Ward's sleeve is covered in badges. But I'm not worried; our patrol has twenty-two badges and more good deeds in the troop book. That's what truly matters - good deeds. The Elks seem to rush new members into earning badges, but Mr. Ellsworth always emphasized starting from the beginning and following the scout oath. Connie is a good patrol leader, but he's obsessed with stunts and badges. Scouting is more than that. When we arrived at Catskill Landing, we were relieved. After a swim and breakfast, we headed to camp. Skinny, who swam differently, excitedly fetched sticks from the water. Although he was treated like a spectacle, no one truly connected with him. But he seemed content with his own enthusiasm. At dawn, we set off for Temple Camp, and I love early hikes as the sun rises, painting the sky red.|"[""1.

To reach Temple Camp, you start by hiking through Catskill village until you reach the old turnpike road. Follow it to a large boarding house where people are waiting for meals or bedtime. Continue up the road through the woods until you spot a turtle (though it may not be there now). Proceed through the woods, following scout signs until you reach Leeds, a village with summer residents. Then, head down Main Street until you catch a whiff of rotten wood, turn towards the willow trees, and find an old sawmill. Shout from there, and they'll hear you at camp. Follow the trail through the woods until you suddenly arrive at the edge of Black Lake, surrounded by trees. Cross the lake by boat to reach Temple Camp, founded by Mr. John Temple, a wealthy man who initially disliked scouts but grew to appreciate them. Uncle Jeb Rushmore, a former trapper, now manages the camp. Upon arrival, you're greeted by boats and fellow scouts, with Uncle Jeb welcoming you to the camp.|"['1.

During a summer at camp, a group of scouts engaged in various activities. One scout, known as Skinny, was determined to win a silver cup for his troop. Despite his thin appearance, Skinny showed bravery and determination. He approached two other scouts rowing near the shore and asked to join them.

I told Alf that winning the cup would be tough with so many skilled swimmers at camp. The moonlit lake was peaceful as we rowed, with the campfire flickering on the shore. Across the water, we spotted two wealthy campers with fancy gear. They seemed friendly, unlike the troublemakers in books. Winton mentioned they had a lavish camp setup, including a cedar chest and modern gadgets. Bert suggested visiting them sometime. As we joined the campfire circle, a scout shared a thrilling sea adventure tale. Skinny looked nervous by the fire, unaware of the upcoming camp tragedy. Little did we know the events that would unfold the next day.|"['1.

That night, my dreams were filled with a canoe and two people paddling in it. The sound of rain on the roof woke me up before dawn, making me realize it was just the rain dripping into the gutter. I drifted back to sleep and dreamt of Skinny with a white face and blood, claiming he wanted to be a Silver Fox. Thunder woke me abruptly, dispelling the eerie feeling. The rainy morning kept most scouts indoors, while three from Boston troop attempted fishing but had to retreat due to the heavy rain. Uncle Jeb had us move the mess boards to the pavilion as the winds picked up. Sitting on the porch, we watched a camper struggle in a canoe, highlighting the importance of digging a trench outside tents during rain. Bert Winton intervened when the camper tried to pay for a shovel, showing kindness in the storm.|['1.

He refused an escort and bravely headed back alone, feeling too proud for boy scouts to guide him. As he disappeared into the rain and mist, he seemed like a ghost. Suddenly, a voice was heard, eerie in the howling wind. Frantically, we launched a boat to rescue someone who had dived and struggled in the storm. The wind and rain made it challenging, but we pushed on. Eventually, we reached two figures, one holding the other above water with a strange grip. The rescuer, Skinny, had blood on his face and a cut on his hand from the rescue. It was a chaotic and intense moment that still haunts me when it storms.|['1.

I searched everywhere for Skinny for hours but couldn't find him. I even went all the way to Leeds, thinking he might be there since he wasn't at the camp. I started to worry because I knew how distressed he was and he was soaked from being in the lake. When I returned to camp, it was sunny, and everyone was preparing for dinner. I had to change my wet clothes. Mr. Ellsworth came in and asked about Skinny. I defended Skinny, saying he deserved appreciation for winning the gold cross. At supper, everyone was talking about Skinny getting the gold cross, except for Skinny himself. During campfire, Mr. Ellsworth and the scoutmasters seemed to be planning a search party.

A group of boys cheered for a scout named Skinny, calling him a water snake. This made another boy upset because they didn't even know Skinny's full name. Skinny then stood up and made a passionate speech about Alfred McCord, who won a gold cross in his troop. Everyone, including the Elks, cheered for Skinny, showing their pride. Mr. Ellsworth, a trustee, then asked for a moment of silence to address the scouts. He thanked everyone for their support and praised Skinny for his heroism.

The gold cross symbolizes honor at the camp, reflecting pride on the wearer, their patrol, troop, and all scouts. Alfred McCord earned this honor. Skinny, overwhelmed with emotion, stood by Connie Bennett, shaking and crying. Hunt Ward congratulated Skinny, who appeared small and fragile. After the campfire, I felt a similar urge to be alone. I found solace near the shore on a rock. Hunt Ward passed by, and we discussed Skinny's treatment. I suggested including Skinny like any other friend.

Mr. Ellsworth requested me to retrieve some letters for the mailbox. As I headed back to the tepee, I noticed a group including Connie, Bert, Hunt, Stut, and Skinny approaching. Skinny, looking thin but smiling, seemed eager, thinking Mr. Ellsworth would give him a gold cross. Inside the tepee, Mr. Ellsworth mentioned a missing roll of money from a rescued mariner. Suspicion fell on Skinny, who struggled to speak. Feeling compelled, I defended Skinny, explaining he was too preoccupied saving a life to bother with money. I criticized the group's focus on material things, urging them to appreciate Skinny's heroic actions. The incident highlighted the importance of valuing bravery over possessions.|"['1.

"One thing I knew for sure was that Skinny went into the woods to be alone, just like he said. It might seem funny that he did it in the rain, but he was already wet. I thought to myself, ""I shouldn't worry about the key; that's not Skinny's concern."" However, I couldn't shake off my unease. Eventually, I reluctantly decided to visit the Ohio troop's bunk up the hill. They had a well-organized troop with two patrols: the Royal Bengal Tigers and the African Tigers. They all wore yellow scarfs with black stripes and had tiger-themed gear. I found Bert Winton, who was perched on the cabin roof with a stick, always prepared. I expressed my mixed feelings about him and my confusion about his thoughts. He reassured me that Skinny went to the house-boat on the Hudson to be alone, following the old creek bed.

One evening, a scout named Blakeley was talking about Skinny, a unique camper, with his friend. Blakeley mentioned how Skinny's behavior was misunderstood by some other campers due to his difficult background. Despite Skinny's challenges, Blakeley believed in him and thought highly of their scoutmaster, Mr. Ellsworth. The conversation turned to an incident involving a camper losing his money, and how Skinny, although often unlucky, was inadvertently involved.

We headed down to the dock, and a few boys mentioned something about Skinny, but we brushed it off. One boy from a Boston troop shared that Skinny's group wouldn't bother with him anymore. As we rowed, observing campers busy with their morning activities, I felt sorry for Skinny. Suddenly, Skinny sprang up, rowing with such skill and grace. When we neared the campers' tent, he turned serious, asking me what we should do. He explained that Skinny didn't take the money, but it's vanished. He believed our old friend, Mr. David Jones, had it at the bottom of Black Lake. He wanted my help since two heads are better than one. Skinny had until Wednesday to sort things out.

There is a young boy named Skinny McCord who came from Bridgeboro with us. They call him Skinny because he's thin and doesn't have much to eat.

Bert recounted an adventure with a civil engineer who was also a scoutmaster. Together, they explored the landscape and discovered turtle shells, evidence of a past creek that once flowed through the area. The engineer pointed out how the creek had rerouted, creating Black Lake where there used to be Bowl Valley. Bert marveled at nature's ability to transform the land, likening it to lakes moving like people in flats. As they navigated Nick's Valley, Bert's feet got wet in the young lakes formed by the creek's old path. The engineer suggested having a scout staff for such explorations, and they trekked through overgrown bushes, uncovering a fish's backbone.

If you look at the map, you'll notice where we stood, right at the edge of the ring I created. The ring was actually a circular hole next to the old creek bed. It was a remarkable sight, about fifty feet deep and thirty feet wide, enclosed by masonry walls resembling a large well. Bert speculated it might have been related to the previous farm, as there was an old foundation nearby. Perhaps it was a silo, but I was more concerned about Skinny. We followed the creek bed until it became overgrown, then veered north and headed straight to the houseboat. After rowing to Catskill to mail letters, we treated ourselves to sodas and snacks.

It was around dinner time when the rain paused, allowing us to cross. I was famished, but hunger wasn't proof of the hour. St. Swithin likely paused for supper, as the rain resumed once we crossed. Concerned about Lieutenant Donnelle's knowledge of the money, my nerves surfaced after letter preparations. We retraced our steps in a downpour, rain falling heavily. Water filled the old creek bed, submerging bushes and dragging them along. Avoiding the creek bed, we waded through waist-high water. Lost in the flooded land, we stumbled into the creek bed, suddenly swimming. Bert suggested keeping close to the hollow amid the rising water. The deluge made navigation challenging, and the water's force was overwhelming. The landscape transformed into a waterlogged maze, disorienting us.

It was quite a challenge to reach the mountains we had set our sights on. The journey was filled with stumbling over submerged hills and feeling like we were going nowhere. Eventually, we found ourselves on higher ground with fewer puddles. Standing near the north side of the old creek bottom, we were clueless about our exact location. All we knew was that we were wet, standing on a hill with water almost reaching our feet as darkness crept in. What we witnessed was water rushing through Nick's Valley towards us and flowing into the creek bed. The sight of trees, possibly parts of houses, and even a tent being carried along by the water was both fascinating and eerie. The landscape was transforming right before our eyes, making us feel like we were witnessing the earth being recreated. Just a few feet away, near the pit, we saw a smashed canoe, a grim reminder of the force of the rushing water. Peering into the pit, we made a chilling discovery - a face, motionless and ghostly against the dark background. It was a stark reminder of the danger and power of the flooding waters.|"['1.

"I shouted, ""Bert! Are you okay, Bert?"" No response. Trembling, I approached the edge, prepared for what was ahead. The darkness below concealed everything. ""I can't be certain,"" I explained, ""but there's a passage leading into the hills from the cave. It's unexplored due to its darkness and dampness.

I easily swam across the calm creek and then trekked through the mountains west of Nick's Valley towards the lake. The dense woods made it tricky to navigate, but glimpses of the valley below helped guide me. Eventually, I reached a vantage point overlooking the lake. The landscape had drastically changed due to a recent flood, with Nick's Cove entirely transformed. Despite the devastation, Temple Camp stood safe across the water. A group of scouts in boats near the old cove caught my attention, including familiar faces like Westy and Pee-wee. Shouting to them, I made my way down the mountainside towards the shore. Several boats awaited me, and among them were Mr. Elting and Uncle Jeb. I informed them that the missing campers were safe elsewhere and directed them to Rebels' Cave for further instructions.|"['1.

"They probably thought I was a bit crazy, emerging from the mountains and yelling about pits and caves. But once Mr. Elting and Uncle Jeb took me onto their boat, I recounted everything that had happened. Uncle Jeb exchanged a glance with Mr. Elting, who looked quite serious. Uncle Jeb then shook his head and mentioned, ""I've never explored Rebel's Cave, but I don't think it connects through there."" Mr. Elting reassured me, ""We're not blaming you or Winton."" He then decided to investigate further. As some scouts rowed to the cave, Mr. Elting and a group of scouts headed to the shore. Lanterns were quickly fetched, along with ropes and a first aid kit. We rowed down to the cave, with several other boats accompanying us. Westy joined us in our boat, providing comfort in the absence of Bert and Skinny. As we approached the cave, the boat with lanterns approached us. Mr. Elting's voice carried clearly in the night, urging us to hurry. We received the aid kit and lanterns, and Uncle Jeb, Westy, and I climbed up to the cave. Due to the water draining, the cave was higher than before, and we navigated through mud to enter.

Suddenly, a chill ran through me, causing my fingers to slip, and the lantern crashed to the ground, startling me. I hesitated for what felt like an eternity, unable to face telling Westy and Uncle Jeb that Bert Winton was in trouble because of my foolish actions. If only I had been more observant like Bert, who always knew his way around. The guilt weighed heavy on me, and I couldn't bring myself to confess. Uncle Jeb tried to console me, reminding me that there were still others to hear from. Despite the reassurance from the others, I couldn't shake off the feeling of responsibility.

Everyone at camp thought Bert Winton was amazing, but his troop didn't seem as impressed. They were peculiar, not getting too excited about him. The next day, everyone was buzzing about Bert. People were taking boats to Nick's Cove to see what was left, and all they talked about was Bert. Some said Skinny wasn't worth it, hinting that he took the money. The Elks didn't seem to care much.

They appeared to be having a great time regardless. I doubt either of them knew much about the gold cross, but they were excited to see Skinny succeed. It was amusing to listen to them discuss scouting. The larger one, Reggie, even asked me if we had a badge for dancing. Can you believe it? He mentioned he might give it a shot. The other one thought stalking meant picking corn from the stalk. Unbelievable! They seemed to really like Bert, but it was Skinny's visit that piqued their interest.
