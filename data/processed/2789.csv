"After the success of the ""Motor Boys Series"" for boys, there was a demand for a similar series for girls. Mrs. Penrose, an expert writer and automobilist, was chosen to write these tales. Cora Kimball drove the Whirlwind, a maroon car that moved silently, like the music of silence. Following the Whirlwind was the silver Flyaway, driven by the Robinson twins, Belle and Bess. The girls were becoming known in Chelton for their daily drives. Bess was skilled at driving, much like Cora. Another car, driven by a girl and a boy, surprised the group. As they prepared to continue their journey, Bess expressed excitement for their upcoming tour, while Cora joked about the boys claiming all the glory for mishaps. With that, the Whirlwind and Flyaway set off on their adventure."|"['1.

"Cora excitedly declared, ""Let's go full speed ahead!"" as she shifted into third gear. ""We need to reach the bridge before the quarter whistle blows, or the Maud Morris family tree might end up as someone's lunch. I really want to mark that tree."" The Whirlwind and the Flyaway zoomed off, passing by chirping chicks and barking dogs, with old farmers giving them plenty of space on the country roads. They headed towards Woodbine, where they planned to finalize the details for the first official motor girls' run.

Amidst the adventure, young chauffeur Paul Hastings and his sister Hazel played significant roles.

"In the dense thicket near the spring, Jack Kimball and Walter Pennington were found. Mysterious chuckles and noises from the woods hinted at human presence, though the sounds resembled those of furry beasts. ""Oh, Clip! Spare me!"" Jack called out as Cecilia playfully scolded him. ""I thought you were fearless,"" Jack added. Cecilia responded, ""I am, but wasting sympathy is not my style."" Meanwhile, the group enjoyed lunch, and Jack reminded them of a 3:30 appointment.

The fierce wind and sand assaulted the motor girls, despite their protective gear. In the midst of a summer storm, the sand aimed for their eyes, seeking shelter there rather than forming mountains. Cecilia sensed an adventure approaching as they neared a cottage. Inside, a woman with evident refinement welcomed them. She revealed her daughter's health struggles but praised her bright spirit. The girls met the daughter, a delicate child in an invalid chair, radiating joy and wisdom beyond her years. Each girl was captivated by the child's presence, especially Clip, who stood spellbound. The child, named Wren, exuded sweetness and grace, captivating everyone with her gentle voice and profound gaze.

"""This is my promise book,"" she began. ""I have to tell you a long story about it. Then I will ask each of you to make me a promise--it is a very strange promise,"" she intoned most seriously. ""But I know some day it will be kept. Some day all these promises will unite in one grand, great demand. Then Fate will have to answer.""

""It's all about grandfather,"" she began. ""I had the dearest, darlingest grandfather, and since he went away I am so lonely. Only for mother,"" she added, with something like an apology. ""Of course, I am never really lonely with mother.""

""You see,"" went on Wren, ""we used to live with grandfather in a beautiful cottage right near the river. He was a sea captain, and couldn't live away from the waves. Then I was strong enough to play on the sands.""

""I'll hurry,"" promised Wren. ""You see, this is the important part of it all. When we lived with grandpa he made a beautiful table--I even helped him to make it. There were tiny pieces of wood all inlaid with anchors, oars and sea emblems. I used to dip them in the hot glue for grandpa.

Cecilia and Jack were heading to Woodbine one morning when Cecilia suddenly grabbed Jack's arm. She confessed that she hadn't planned to join the girls' trip but only helped with the arrangements for fun. As they arrived, Clip called Jack inside where Wren, a disabled child, sat with her promise book. Cecilia introduced Jack, and Wren observed him closely, seeking assurance of his friendship. Meanwhile, Bess felt hurt by Jack's attention to Cecilia and their ride. She expressed her disappointment to Cora, insinuating that Jack's excuse of a sick relative might not be genuine.

Sure enough, Jack, Walter, Ed, and some other friends were all piled up on a hay rack, dressed in farmer clothes, atop what appeared to be an automobile. The girls had planned for dinner at a quaint tea-house on the outskirts of Hollyville, but the boys seemed determined to continue their adventure. The thought of the boys in a tea-house run by college girls was amusing to the group. Cora jokingly appointed Gertrude as the monitor of their car to ensure no troubles were brought up during the ride. As they drove, a ram unexpectedly leaped into the car, causing chaos. Another car driven by a veiled girl approached, leading to a dramatic rescue mission by the group.

Jack explained to the girls that they had encountered a ram during their trip, causing some chaos. Maud was limping, and Daisy had a hand to her face, clinging to Walter. Hazel exchanged a knowing look with Cora, indicating they needed help. Cora teased Walter about the ram, suggesting it was all part of a plan to challenge the girls. The owner of the ram shared stories of its mischievous behavior, making it clear he was not an easy animal to handle. Ed proposed a competition to reward the girl with the best performance during the trip with the ram's coat. Despite the chaos, the group managed to secure the ram, with Clip insisting on helping.

Clip inspected her runabout, relieved to find it undamaged. She wasn't out for leisure but had urgent matters in town. Suddenly, Jack Kimball appeared, surprising Clip. She declined his offer for a ride, needing to rush off. As she bid farewell to her friends, Maud mentioned a promise to find an old table for a little girl.

Gertrude praised Tillie's artistic talents, while Cora reminisced about Adele's unique apron from a past event. As they chatted, Belle admired the charming surroundings. The group enjoyed the peaceful ambiance until interrupted by two men discussing patent papers. Hazel, concerned about her unwell brother, debated calling him.

Cora, trying to compose herself, expressed a foreboding feeling about the night ahead. A sudden honk startled them as Ed Foster arrived with a man. Cora quickly engaged in conversation with Ed, hinting at an emergency. Hazel was called back due to her sick brother, offering to ride back with Ed. Ed explained a troubling situation involving a missing promise book that could impact a legal case. He intended to help find Clip and resolve the issue. Cora, determined to assist Cecilia Thayer, considered abandoning the motor girls' tour. Ed urged Cora to continue the tour to avoid the distress of the unfolding events.

Everyone quickly agreed that it was a good idea, despite Adele and Tillie's concerns about bringing strangers into their homes where others were expected. It was decided the party would wait until the next morning for the tea-house girls to join. Cora had messages to send. She tried to reach Jack and Walter but only got their maids. Eventually, she reached Ed, who assured her that everything was fine. Cora found his response vague but had to accept it. Each girl used the tea-house telephone extensively that evening, contacting their homes and relatives they planned to visit during the trip. Cora asked to mind the shop while the others prepared to leave. She enjoyed the solitude on the porch, listening to the girls in the meadow. Despite Ed's warning about Rob Roland, Cora remained composed when he arrived, discussing Miss Thayer's efforts to help little Wren and her family's property, including the scrapbook.|"['1.

Cora cautiously mentioned that the group might be looking for decorations at Breakwater for the machines. She entrusted the Whirlwind to Tillie, praising her artistic practicality. Cora expressed her desire to have Hazel join them, insisting that she must come if her brother is better. Duncan was eager for everyone to come to Breakwater for an auto run. Cora, engrossed in conversation, suddenly realized the speed of the car, making her nervous.

"""Don't worry, Cora,"" said Duncan confidently. ""We're fine. It's just a fine, and I always have change."" The man scowled, warning them about the dangers of their reckless joy ride. The officer, still catching his breath, marveled at their speed. Duncan, a doctor in a rush to Chelton, negotiated a reasonable fine. Tom advised the officer to be fair, hinting at Reed's shady dealings. Cora, anxious about the time, watched as Duncan sprinted towards the meadow to find the judge.

Cora trusted Tom's judgment and was relieved he had gone to help Duncan. She got out of the car to pick wildflowers but noticed a machine approaching. It was Mr. Reed from Roland, Reed & Company. He offered to help Cora get to Chelton, but she politely declined, waiting for Dr. Bennet. Mr. Reed seemed insistent but eventually left due to a noon appointment.

"Cora interrupted, ""No, it's me he's interested in. He asked me to ride back to Chelton with him. I know! It's Wren!

""Hanna, get your charges first-hand from now on. No tips from anyone, got it?"" Hanna smiled, knowing Reed had handled the compensation.

Cora and Jack were exploring their home together. Jack was making a lot of noise while following Cora around the house. When they paused, Jack suggested taking turns to visit different girls instead of all leaving town at once. Cora mentioned her suspicions about Wren's missing book and how Ida Giles might be involved due to her association with Sid Wilcox. Jack shared his failed attempt to find Clip, who had been spending a lot of time with Wren. Cora expressed her concerns about Clip's influence on Wren's behavior.

""That's simple. Reed has been frequenting the place lately. Being a girl has its advantages. You can follow important leads without raising suspicion. I'm eager to see the commotion when the fete happens,"" Jack chuckled.

Cora was surprised by the sudden invitation to visit Breakwater, but she accepted it eagerly. Ed, on the other hand, had trouble with the ram, which wouldn't cooperate with him even with different coats on. Cora asked Jack to take her to Hazel's, where she needed to meet Dr. Bennet at two-thirty. The group discussed legal issues involving Wren and Cora, with Mr. Reed's involvement causing concern. Dr. Bennet arrived unexpectedly, informing Cora about a plan to subpoena her in a legal case.

Duncan vaguely explained that the child had a good chance of recovering from the wrong treatment they received. The runaways were eventually forgiven, despite some initial confusion. A merry group gathered to plan a trip over Breakwater roads. The girls decorated their cars creatively. Tillie transformed the Whirlwind into a moving garden, using flowers and foliage.
