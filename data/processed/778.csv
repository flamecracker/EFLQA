The White House, nestled deep in the countryside, brought excitement to the children who had been confined in London for two long years. The journey from the station felt endless, with eager faces peering out the carriage windows at every passing house, hoping it was theirs. Finally, atop a hill, the white house with a green garden and an orchard came into view. The children burst out of the carriage, their legs tangled in the rush to explore the surroundings. Despite its ordinary appearance and lack of conveniences, the house felt like a Fairy Palace in an Earthly Paradise to the children, a stark contrast to the straight lines and flat streets of London.

The kids thoroughly explored the gardens and outhouses before being cleaned up for tea, realizing they would be happy at the White House. They knew it from the start, especially after seeing the jasmine-covered back of the house and the lush green lawn. They discovered a stable with old hay and an abandoned swing. The best part was there were no rules to restrict their adventures, unlike in London where everything is off-limits. The White House sat on a hill with a wood behind it, offering a picturesque view of a valley with white buildings and a red brewery.

Cyril wanted to dig a cave to play smugglers, but the others feared being buried alive. So, they all worked together to dig a hole through the castle to Australia. The children believed the world was round, thinking Australian children walked upside down on the other side. They dug with spades until Jane, called Pussy, suggested using their hands. The sand was soft, dry, and had shells. They found a cave, but it was disappointing. Anthea screamed as they discovered something moving in the hole. A furry creature emerged, with eyes like a snail's and ears like a bat's. The children were curious and asked the creature who it was, trying not to make it angry.|['1.

The Psammead, a magical sand-fairy, shared fascinating tales with the children. They quickly adapted to this astonishing encounter. The Psammead reminisced about a time when sand-fairies granted wishes. People once wished for creatures like the Pterodactyl, Megatherium, Ichthyosaurus, and Plesiosaurus for meals. However, the Psammead revealed a sad truth - sand-fairies turned to stone at sunset if they got wet. The children's habit of building sand castles led to the demise of sand-fairies. The Psammead, recalling a chilling incident, decided to settle in a warm, dry sand house. Despite being asked for more stories, the Psammead refused, hinting at a mysterious past.|"['1.

Have you ever imagined what you would wish for if you had three wishes granted to you? These children had often discussed this idea, but when the Sand-fairy offered them the chance, they struggled to decide. Anthea remembered a secret wish she shared with Jane, but the boys couldn't think of anything. The Sand-fairy then proposed granting one wish per day among them. As the Sand-fairy vanished, the children suddenly found themselves transformed into beautiful strangers. Confusion and disbelief filled the air as they realized they were now looking at each other in unfamiliar forms. Anthea recognized her siblings by small details, but they all felt lost without the familiar faces of their brothers and sisters. Cyril, Anthea, and Robert now faced the challenge of befriending their own transformed baby brother, the Lamb, who was upset and difficult to handle.|"[""1.

The children faced a challenging task that took over an hour. The Lamb was hungry and thirsty, making it even harder. Finally reaching home, Jane handed the baby to Martha, the nursemaid. But the door was slammed shut by Martha, leaving them outside. Despite trying to get the servants' attention, they were ignored. Feeling hungry and thirsty, they sat under a hedge, fearing they would turn into stone. Cyril joked about turning to stone, causing fear among the group. Eventually, hunger, fright, and tiredness led them to sleep. Upon waking at twilight, they were relieved to find they had not turned into stone. Anthea was overjoyed to see their normal appearances, finding comfort in their familiar faces.|"[""1.

The kids, as radiant as the day, detained them until nightfall. They couldn't return until the kids left. Martha, irate, scolded them for wandering with strangers. Anthea awoke from a vivid dream where animals in the rain at the zoo were unhappy. Her brother Robert woke her by dripping water on her face. Anthea and Robert had the same dream, including a wish that made them all beautiful, which they found dreadful. Cyril insisted it wasn't a dream but reality.

The three children got dressed, feeling like they were in a dream after their encounter with the Sand-fairy. Anthea became certain that it was real after a scolding from Martha. They discussed Martha taking the Lamb to see her cousins in Rochester. They imagined Martha pretending the Lamb was a noble duke while wearing her best clothes.

Cyril mumbled something about behaving like a girl, and the group fell silent. They faced a dilemma - saying 'Yes' meant giving up their other wishes, while saying 'No' would be impolite. Remembering their manners, they hesitated. The Sand-fairy reassured them, saying they didn't need to trouble themselves. Cyril eagerly replied, while the others felt guilty and hoped the Fairy would stop lecturing them. The Fairy then offered them a choice of gold or notes. Overwhelmed, the children ran towards the road. Anthea managed to thank the Fairy before they fled. Looking back, they saw the sand-pit filled with dazzling gold coins. They played with the coins before Cyril suggested they spend it quickly as it might disappear at sunset. Excited, they filled their pockets and planned to buy things in the village, hoping the gold wouldn't turn to stone.|"['1.

"""No, silly - we'll hire it. Then, we'll head to Rochester and buy lots of things. Let's take as much as we can carry.

They filled their pockets with gold coins and set off to walk to the village. The road was dusty, the sun was scorching, and the gold weighed them down.

At The Chequers, the children's fairy gold caused quite a stir. Anthea, cleverly negotiating with a man named S. Crispin, secured a ride to Rochester in a pony-trap. The children relished the new experience of being driven along scenic roads, quietly making grand plans with their newfound wealth. However, spending the fairy gold proved challenging, as the tradespeople of Rochester were hesitant to accept the unfamiliar currency. Anthea's attempt to purchase a hat with three spade guineas was met with suspicion, as the shopkeepers doubted the legitimacy of the coins.

They picked a simple store where the girls bought cotton gloves. The gloves cost sixpence three-farthings, but the lady at the shop couldn't change a guinea. So, they used Cyril's money for the gloves and a green purse. They visited more shops for toys, scents, handkerchiefs, and books, but no one could break the guinea. They got dirtier, hungry, and tired. They tried to buy food but couldn't. Finally, they sneaked into a pastry shop and each grabbed three buns, making a messy snack. After finishing the buns, they bravely went to the Saracen's Head inn to inquire about a horse and carriage. Despite being dirty, they approached the innkeeper with guineas, but he was unimpressed. The innkeeper threatened to involve the police, and the children were taken away, feeling defeated.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did the girls buy at the first store?\nA) Toys\nB) Scented candles\nC) Cotton gloves\nD) Handkerchiefs\nE) Books', 'Question 2:\nHow much did the cotton gloves cost?\nA) Eightpence\nB) Sixpence three-farthings\nC) Ninepence\nD) Fivepence\nE) Tenpence', ""Question 3:\nWhy did the lady at the shop use Cyril's money for the gloves and a green purse?\nA) Because the girls did not have enough money\nB) Because the lady wanted to help them\nC) Because the girls lost their money\nD) Because the lady did not have change for a guinea\nE) Because the girls wanted to buy more items"", ""Question 4:\nWhere did the girls go to inquire about a horse and carriage?\nA) Pastry shop\nB) Toy store\nC) Saracen's Head inn\nD) Bookstore\nE) Handkerchief shop"", 'Question 5:\nHow did the girls obtain food when they were hungry?\nA) They bought it from a pastry shop\nB) They stole buns from a pastry shop\nC) They asked for food at the inn\nD) They found food on the street\nE) They bought food from a grocery store', 'Question 6:\nHow did the innkeeper react when the children approached him with guineas?\nA) He was impressed\nB) He called the police\nC) He gave them a horse and carriage\nD) He offered them a room\nE) He scolded them']"|"['C) Cotton gloves', 'B) Sixpence three-farthings', 'D) Because the lady did not have change for a guinea', ""C) Saracen's Head inn"", 'B) They stole buns from a pastry shop', 'B) He called the police']"
The children were speechless with rage and horror as they were driven through the streets of Rochester. Tears of anger and shame blinded them. Robert accidentally bumped into a passer-by, but they didn't recognize her until she spoke. Martha, the passer-by, couldn't see the fairy gold the children had received. The children thought Martha was noble until they remembered the Fairy's promise that servants wouldn't notice the gifts. At the police station, the children's pockets were empty as the fairy gold had vanished. Martha took them home in a grand carriage, scolding them for going to Rochester alone.

The morning after the children had experienced boundless wealth, acquiring only a few items like cotton gloves, penny buns, and a pony-cart ride, they awoke without the previous happiness. Their wishes for Beauty and Wealth had not brought true joy. Yet, the unexpected events were more entertaining than mundane days. The Baby's antics during breakfast caused chaos, including a spill of goldfish. After the commotion settled, Jane had to mend her dress torn the day before. Despite the mishaps, the children pondered the Psammead's nature. Robert suggested leaving the Sand-fairy alone and playing a game of forts instead. Cyril believed the Psammead didn't mean harm, emphasizing the need for a more practical wish.|"['1.

Jane and her siblings had a unique opportunity to make a wish that could come true. They were excited about the chance and brainstormed what to wish for. They wanted to wish for something nice and have a jolly day. The children were used to talking together and listening to each other. They decided to wish for fifty pounds in two-shilling pieces.

The Lamb was enjoying the fresh country air, feeling as lively as a sandhopper. While the older children wanted to discuss their wishes if they found the Psammead again, the Lamb just wanted to have fun. He mischievously threw sand at Anthea, then buried his head and kicked his legs in the air, getting sand in his eyes and howling. To soothe his eyes, Robert uncorked a bottle of ginger beer, but it stung, causing more howls. Jane remembered the gentle way to remove things from children's eyes, using her wet tongue. After a moment of silence, the Sand-fairy warned about being careful with wishes. The Psammead shared a cautionary tale of a boy who wished he was dead and learned a valuable lesson.|"['1.

At the gate, the children stopped to move the Lamb to Robert's back. Suddenly, a fancy carriage appeared with a grand lady inside. She had a white lace dress, red ribbons, and a fluffy dog with a red ribbon. The lady, Lady Chittenden, stopped the carriage and took the Lamb awkwardly, claiming he should travel luxuriously. The children, surprised, followed the carriage as it headed to a grand park. The lady hesitated, and a quarrel broke out between the coachman and footman. In the chaos, Cyril seized the opportunity, carried the Lamb away, and hid with his siblings in the woods until the carriage left.|"['1.

The gipsies whispered, and Cyril seized the moment to whisper, ""Sunset! We'll escape then."" Robert interrupted, ""What about dinner?"" The others scoffed at his concern. Jane whispered, ""Fancy worrying about dinner when the Baby..."" Robert winked, signaling a secret plan. Unaware, his siblings felt superior. The gipsies caught on, warning about false accusations. The gipsy woman kindly offered food. As the gipsies went to work, the children and the Lamb sat on the grass. Jane whispered reassurance. At supper, they enjoyed boiled rabbit and a bird dish. The Lamb liked bread with sugar. The children kept the Lamb entertained, and by sunset, he charmed the gipsies with his manners. Everyone eagerly awaited the evening."|['1.

Cyril softly expressed his longing for the sunset, wishing for sensible wishes that would be of real use. As shadows grew longer, the sun disappeared behind the hill, yet it had not fully set. The gypsies, now calm, realized the sunset had occurred. Anthea, in a hurry, tried to explain the Lamb's nightly routine. The gypsy woman, touched by the children's kindness, blessed the Lamb for bravery, love, work, and safe travels. Despite a mishap with spilled ink during a rainy day indoors, the children decided to write letters to their mother. Unfortunately, the ink spilled over Anthea's secret drawer, and the Lamb disrupted Robert's attempt, resulting in a messy letter.|"['1.

Robert had not even started his letter. He was sketching a ship on the blotting-paper while trying to figure out what to write. The ink got spilled, so he helped Anthea clean her desk and promised to make a new secret drawer for her. Post-time arrived, and his letter remained unfinished. Cyril penned a quick, lengthy letter, then set a trap for slugs. However, his letter went missing, possibly eaten by slugs. Jane's letter was the only one sent. She intended to share about the Psammead but got stuck on spelling the word. She quickly wrapped up her letter as the postman's horn sounded. Robert dashed out in the rain to hand the letter to the postman. Despite their plans, the children never managed to inform their mother about the Sand-fairy.|"['1.

Have you ever woken up at five in the morning on a beautiful summer day? The sunlight is a mix of pink and yellow, casting a magical glow on the dew-covered grass and trees. Shadows behave differently in the morning, moving in the opposite direction compared to the evening, creating a fascinating sight that feels like entering a new world. Anthea, a well-behaved girl, had a special routine to wake up early. She set her mind to wake up at five, performing a unique head-banging ritual to match the desired waking time. Despite feeling sleepy, Anthea used a fairy charm of splashing her face with cold water to stay awake. She embarked on a secret adventure, sneaking out of the window to visit the Psammead, a grumpy creature granting wishes. Anthea shared her concerns with the Psammead, asking for no wishes until after breakfast to have a meaningful conversation.|['1.

Anthea explained the incredible opportunity they had been given to have their wishes granted by the Psammead. The creature warned them to be cautious with their wishes, citing a story of a boy who wished for wings but forgot they would turn to stone at sunset, leading to a dangerous fall. The Psammead emphasized that in the past, people wished for tangible things that could easily be turned to stone, unlike the high-flying wishes people have nowadays. It explained that such fanciful wishes couldn't be turned into stone and would simply vanish. After the Psammead's explanation, each child felt a peculiar sensation on their shoulders, and beautiful, colorful wings appeared, making them feel both heavy and light at the same time.|"['1.

"Anthea asked, ""Does it hurt?"" but no one replied as Robert spread his wings and took flight. He looked awkward in his knickerbocker suit, especially his oversized boots. The others followed suit, rising into the air with wide wings, feeling the exhilarating rush of wind against their faces. Flying was like a dream, a magical experience. They soared over fields and woods, marveling at the beauty below. As they crossed an orchard, hunger struck. They indulged in plums until a man appeared, startled by the fluttering wings. Anthea reassured him and paid for the plums. The man, bewildered, accepted the threepenny-bit and vowed to be a better person.

One day, four children found themselves in a predicament. Hungry and tired from flying with their magical wings, they decided to seek food by visiting farms. Unfortunately, their attempts were met with aggressive dogs and frightened farmers. Desperate, they perched on a church tower to devise a plan. Cyril proposed taking provisions from a clergyman's larder window, using their combined money to pay later. Anthea, feeling guilty for the act, tearfully agreed. After pooling their money, they wrote a note explaining their dire hunger and left it with the payment. With a risky but carefully planned strategy, Cyril entered the larder while Robert and Anthea waited outside to receive the food. Jane kept watch and whistled softly to alert them of any danger.

Stealing is wrong, but in this instance, it seemed more like a fair business deal to the four hungry children. They believed the chicken, bread, and soda-water they took were necessities not easily bought for the price they paid. Though they refrained from taking more tempting treats, they justified their actions by the fear of contamination from rainwater germs. A makeshift picnic was held at the tower's top, where they struggled to carve, eat with fingers, and drink soda-water from a syphon. Despite the messy meal, the children relished the food and the adventure. This experience taught them valuable lessons about resourcefulness and the consequences of their actions.|"['1.

The children had a peculiar experience after a hearty meal and a nap under their wings on a church tower. As the sun set, they awoke to a chilly twilight, realizing they were far from home with little money and a mysterious soda-water syphon. Feeling disoriented, they decided to explore a turret on the tower. Anthea comforted Jane, and Cyril proposed a plan to sneak back unnoticed. They coordinated a loud distraction to cover their escape, imitating sounds to mask their presence. The children, still in shock, followed Cyril's lead cautiously.

"""One, two, three!"" A loud yell echoed through the air, causing a commotion among the owls and starlings nearby. Startled, a maid dashed down the stairs of the Vicarage into the kitchen, where she fainted after claiming to have seen a ghost. Although untrue, the girl's nerves were clearly rattled by the yelling. Concerned, the Vicar decided to investigate, fearing someone was being harmed in the church. He prepared to go alone, but his wife insisted on sending for help. Andrew, the cook's cousin, armed with a gun, bravely led the way up the dark church tower stairs. As they ascended, the group discussed the possibility of a lunatic being present. Andrew, feeling uneasy about potential traps, stuck close behind.

The kids clung together on the other side of the door, scared and hoarse from crying. Cyril managed to speak hoarsely. The keeper felt proud as he opened the door and shone a lantern on the group of kids. They were taken down the tower, but Cyril struggled with a soda-water syphon slipping under his jacket.

"""No,"" Robert said, ""but the wings caused trouble, like wishes always do. The others are indoors, and I only got out for half-an-hour to make a wish. Please let me wish quickly."" The Psammead agreed, but Robert struggled to wish. He could only think of things for himself like toffee or a clasp-knife. As he rushed home, he worried about the wishes the others might have made. They might have wished for rabbits or chocolate. When he turned the corner, he was shocked to see a castle instead of his house. Men in armour surrounded him, and he waved at them. Two men approached him, and he stood his ground. They praised him for his bravery, and Robert felt encouraged.

The impressive leader Robert encountered was like a character from a historical romance with armor, a helmet, a horse, a crest, feathers, a shield, a lance, and a sword. Despite the mix of armor styles from different eras, Robert was in awe. The shield bore three red lions on a blue background, evoking grandeur. The leader's appearance and camp setup might have surprised others, but Robert was captivated. The leader's kind face and fair hair put Robert at ease. Robert felt a connection with the leader, believing he could understand the magical tale of wishes and the Psammead better than anyone else.

Robert felt a surge of desperation. He believed that the castle and its occupants were not real, merely a result of someone's foolish wish. The captain and his men initially pitied Robert's delusion but then grew stern as they suspected his act of madness to elude capture. Sir Wulfric, the nobleman, was offended by the accusation but eventually acknowledged Robert's words. To Robert's surprise, Sir Wulfric granted him freedom and assigned Jakin to accompany him. Robert, overwhelmed by the situation, expressed his wish to be with the others. As he recounted his ordeal, his friends admired his bravery and appointed him as the leader of their defense. Anthea suggested using bows and arrows to fend off the approaching attackers, but Robert, cautious of the real weapons possessed by the enemy, advised against provoking them.

Cyril explained the strange situation to his friends. They found themselves in a castle with thick stone walls and a great arched gatehouse. As they explored, they saw the drawbridge up and the portcullis down, making the moat look wide and deep. In the courtyard, they saw Martha and the cook moving oddly, with the Lamb suspended in mid-air, laughing. Feeling overwhelmed, they sat down in a dim room filled with dry sticks. Cyril reasoned that the servants couldn't notice the castle because they had wished for it to blend in with the house. This mix-up meant the servants saw the house while the children saw the castle. They were in a mysterious and magical place where wishes came true.|"['1. What did Cyril and his friends find themselves in?\nA) A forest\nB) A castle\nC) A village\nD) A cave\nE) A beach', '2.

Jane expressed her concern about the invisible dinner, fearing they wouldn't be able to eat if they couldn't see the food. The children explored the castle but found no food. Martha appeared with an invisible tray, serving unseen food. Disappointed, they realized the dinner was invisible and unfeelable. Cyril, with his understanding of invisibility, demonstrated that when they bit into the air, it turned into real food. The children followed suit, managing to eat their invisible meal.

After dinner, the children prepared for the impending attack on the castle. Robert, as captain, led them to the top of a tower to survey the surroundings. They saw the besieging party's tents beyond the moat, where men were busy sharpening weapons. A group arrived with a tree trunk for a battering ram, unsettling Cyril. Anthea mentioned boiling lead defense tactics from Bodiam Castle. The children found heavy weapons in the castle, planning to use stones and daggers in defense. Anthea cleverly suggested using biscuits as provisions for the garrison during their castle defense game. As they snacked on biscuits and water from the well, Robert kept watch on the besiegers' movements, feeling the gravity of the situation more than the others.|"['1.

Anthea happily pointed out of the small window, drawing attention to the colorful flags on the lances of the approaching group. She admired the leader on the grey horse. Jane, after looking, found the scene more beautiful than frightening. The green grass, white tents, fluttering flags, shining armor, and vibrant clothing made it seem like a splendid painting. The sound of trumpets filled the air, followed by the clinking of armor and murmurs of voices. A trumpeter by the moat blew a powerful blast. Robert urged everyone to cheer and make noise with their daggers to show bravery.

The children felt almost brave as they followed Robert's lead, dropping stones out of the narrow windows. Below, there was a confused noise and some groans. Robert declared they wouldn't surrender, eagerly waiting for the sun to set. Despite the enemy's attempts to breach the door, the children remained defiant. Anthea poured water down on the foes through a lead-hole, but it seemed to have little effect. Robert, eager for more action, poured water through an arrow-slit, causing the enemy's shouts to suddenly cease.

Martha scolded the children for their mischievous behavior, warning them to go to bed immediately. Despite their regrets, the children couldn't help but find excuses for their actions. Cyril, the eldest, tried to cheer up his siblings and urged them to obey Martha to avoid further trouble.

The group sat down on the sand next to Robert, who was crying out of anger. Cyril was upset with Jane, Robert was furious with Anthea, and the girls were sad. No one was happy with the baker's boy. Robert, in his fury, dug his hands into the sand and suddenly felt something furry - the Psammead. His wish to be bigger than the baker's boy was granted, and he grew to an enormous size. The others laughed at the sight of the giant Robert in his oversized clothes. The Psammead refused to make them all the same size, saying Robert needed to learn a lesson.

Robert, a giant, was hungry but not afraid. He was crouched in a tent, unable to stand due to his size. The woman brought him bread and cheese, satisfying his hunger. Meanwhile, the man posted sentinels to prevent Robert from escaping with his money. Bill, the organizer, efficiently packed up the tent's attractions and introduced Robert as the Emperor of San Francisco's son. People paid to see the giant, creating a stir. A young man and his sweetheart were the first to enter and were startled by Robert's size. Despite the initial fright, Robert's demeanor was friendly as he greeted and interacted with visitors.

Cyril explained that the giant would finish his tea soon and could have visitors until sunset. However, he emphasized that the giant must be left alone at sunset, as he acts strangely at that time and could cause harm if disturbed. The children quickly devised a plan inside the tent. Cyril instructed the girls to leave immediately and go home without worrying about the pony-cart. He and Robert would manage to escape, similar to Sydney Carton, but the girls needed to go to avoid any trouble. Cyril then informed the girls that the giant wanted some ears of corn from the next field. He covered the giant with sacks and an old tarpaulin, ensuring he was comfortable. The brothers whispered their strategy while outside, the merry-go-round played lively tunes to attract attention.|"['1.

Two boys, Cyril and Robert, rushed home after a day of adventures. They ran through fields and roads to reach home as quickly as the girls did. The next morning, they had to drag the pony-trap home without the help of the giant Robert. Cyril, recalling how useful wishes could be, visited the Psammead early the next day. He asked the Psammead if it still felt the effects of Robert's tears from the day before. The Psammead, in a good mood, asked Cyril what he wanted. Cyril requested that they be granted wishes whenever they thought of them, without having to disturb the Psammead each time. The Psammead, weary of their constant wishes, agreed but warned them about wishing for things they might not truly desire.|"['1.

Cyril expressed frustration over the Lamb's actions with his watch, but later calmed down and agreed to take the Lamb to the woods. The group decided not to wish for anything more until they truly desired it. While sitting under a chestnut tree, the Lamb spoke about growing up, sparking everyone's imagination. Suddenly, the Lamb accidentally broke a watch, leading to a shocking transformation. The Lamb rapidly grew into a young man before their eyes, leaving them stunned. The grown-up Lamb settled against the tree, looking tired and ready to sleep. The children wondered if this new Lamb retained the same characteristics as the original one or if his mind had matured along with his body.|"[""1.

Anthea expressed her concern about the situation, fearing that whether the Lamb had grown up inside or remained a baby, it would be challenging to handle him. The group worried about the approaching dinner time and lacked the nuts needed for the meal. Cyril regretted his role in the predicament, feeling miserable about the prospect of returning without the Lamb. Despite Cyril's guilt, they debated what to do next. Robert suggested waking the Lamb to see if he could lead them to Maidstone with the money in his bags. Anthea was moved to tears imagining the Lamb alone in a club. The grown-up Lamb, known as Hilary, corrected Anthea on his name and expressed his father's wishes. Anthea lamented her deceitful actions silently.|"[""1.

The Lamb politely declined the company, suggesting that the children go home for their meals. The grown-up Lamb, displaying a condescending attitude, told the kids to be quiet and not make a nuisance of themselves. He promised a reward if they behaved. The new Lamb, with an air of superiority, mentioned plans to go to Maidstone on a bike, leaving the kids behind. The children, feeling desperate, exchanged looks and devised a plan involving a pin to sabotage the Lamb's bicycle. The plan succeeded, leading to a tea-and-ham meal for the Lamb, paid for by Robert's earnings. Despite the disappointment of the Lamb having no money, the children persisted in trying to convince him to spend the day in the woods. The Lamb, after fixing the punctures, warned the children of a lady approaching and urged them to hide due to their dirty appearance.

The lady from the house appeared, and the girl spoke to her. The Lamb tipped his hat as she passed him. The children strained to listen but couldn't hear. They thought it was fair, even with the Lamb in his state. Behind the pig-pail, Cyril whispered that the lady should know the truth about the Lamb being just a baby. The Lamb, now called St Maur, fixed the lady's bicycle and talked like a grown-up. Anthea intervened, revealing the truth about the Lamb. The lady left, shocked by the encounter. The children, dirty and uncovered, explained the situation. The lady rode off, thinking the children were lunatics. The children took the Lamb home, who seemed confused.

At sunset, the children reached the White House. The older kids wanted to wait until the sun fully set to see their baby brother Lamb again. But the now grown-up Lamb insisted on moving forward. Martha, the servant, greeted them in the garden. Thanks to the Psammead's magic, Martha saw the usual children with the baby Lamb, while the children still saw the grown-up Lamb. Martha carried the grown-up Lamb inside, mistaking him for the baby. The children realized they had unintentionally wished for Red Indians in England, causing chaos.

She spoke bravely, but the children's hearts raced, and their breaths grew short. The Red Indians closed in, their angry murmurs filling the air. Robert whispered a plan to run to the Psammead for help. As they charged through the crowd, knocking down some Indians, they sprinted towards the sand-pit. The chief ordered his followers back as the children leaped over fallen bodies. The children's escape caused chaos, and the Indians searched for firewood to build a fire. However, they returned empty-handed, unable to find any wood in that part of Kent. The children, fearing the worst, were then surrounded by Indians brandishing knives.

Anthea agreed with Cyril that it was a good idea to focus on putting flowers in all the vases instead of thinking about diamonds. They had always managed to make things right in the end before. Soon after dinner, their mother returned and was warmly welcomed by her eight children. They were tempted to tell her about the Psammead, but managed to keep it a secret. Mother shared stories about Granny's pigeons and Auntie Emma's lame tame donkey. She was pleased with the flowery decorations in the house, making everything feel natural and pleasant. Mother discovered a pearl ring with diamonds and a valuable diamond necklace in her room, left by burglars who had stolen Lady Chittenden's jewelry. Martha, the maid, revealed her plans to leave for marriage to a gamekeeper named Beale, who had helped her clean the windows.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Anthea and Cyril decide to focus on instead of thinking about diamonds?\nA) Baking cakes\nB) Putting flowers in vases\nC) Planning a party\nD) Going for a walk\nE) Cleaning the house', 'Question 2:\nHow did the children feel about telling their mother about the Psammead?\nA) Excited\nB) Nervous\nC) Indifferent\nD) Angry\nE) Surprised', ""Question 3:\nWhat did Mother share stories about?\nA) Granny's rabbits\nB) Auntie Emma's cats\nC) Granny's pigeons\nD) Auntie Emma's dogs\nE) Granny's horses"", 'Question 4:\nWhat did Mother find in her room that had been left by burglars?\nA) A pearl ring with sapphires\nB) A ruby necklace\nC) A pearl ring with diamonds\nD) A silver bracelet\nE) A gold watch', 'Question 5:\nWhy was Mother pleased with the decorations in the house?\nA) They were colorful\nB) They were flowery\nC) They were made of diamonds\nD) They were handmade\nE) They were shiny', 'Question 6:\nWho revealed plans to leave for marriage to a gamekeeper named Beale?\nA) Anthea\nB) Cyril\nC) Mother\nD) Martha\nE) Psammead']"|"['B) Putting flowers in vases', 'B) Nervous', ""C) Granny's pigeons"", 'C) A pearl ring with diamonds', 'B) They were flowery', 'D) Martha']"

Anthea led the way to the sand-pit where they found the Psammead basking in the sun. The creature, with a tearful voice, offered to grant them wishes but begged not to be asked again after that day.
