Danny Meadow Mouse was preoccupied with his short tail, feeling ashamed and sulking instead of playing in the sunshine like before. His friends started passing by without stopping, until one day old Mr. Toad sat down and pointed out that being slim and handsome suits a Meadow Mouse better than a long tail that would be a nuisance. Mr. Toad advised Danny to be content with himself, just as he was. Life for Danny was like a game of hide and seek, always wary of potential predators around him. He trusted friends like Peter Rabbit and Jimmy Skunk but kept a watchful eye on enemies like Reddy Fox and Billy Mink. When the rough Brother North Wind brought snow, Danny enjoyed tunneling through it, finding joy and safety in his cozy grass house.|"['1.

Deep in the snow-covered tunnels, Danny Meadow Mouse felt secure from Reddy Fox's pursuit. Granny Fox, wise to the tunnels, listened intently for Danny's movements.

On the first, second, and third days, Danny Meadow Mouse didn't see Granny Fox or Reddy Fox. He enjoyed scurrying through tunnels under the snow and peeking out of doorways. One morning, he found his doorways closed by fresh snow. After a hearty breakfast, he dug a hole to peep out at the sun. Looking around, he noticed a peculiar heap of snow.

Danny Meadow Mouse happily sang and skipped on the snow-covered Green Meadows, feeling smart for outwitting Granny Fox. He was carefree, unaware of the lurking danger above.

Danny Meadow Mouse was a curious little creature who often gazed up at Skimmer the Swallow and Ol’ Mistah Buzzard soaring high above the Green Meadows and the Green Forest. He dreamed of flying like them, imagining the beauty of the world from above. However, one day, his dreams turned into a nightmare when Hooty the Owl swooped down and captured him with his sharp claws. As Danny dangled in the air, he realized the danger he had overlooked. The pain from Hooty's claws was nothing compared to the fear of being eaten by the owl.

Just ahead of him was the Old Briar-patch where Peter Rabbit lives so safely. Every old bramble in it was covered with snow and it was very, very beautiful. Really everything was just as beautiful as ever—the moonlight, the Green Forest, the snow-covered Green Meadows, the Old Briar-patch. The only change was in Danny Meadow Mouse himself, and it was all because he had forgotten. But Danny only struggled harder than ever. It seemed to him that Hooty wasn’t holding him as tightly as at first. He felt one of Hooty’s claws slip. It tore his coat and hurt dreadfully, but it slipped! The fact is, Hooty had only grabbed Danny Meadow Mouse by the loose part of his coat, and up in the air he couldn’t get hold of Danny any better. Danny kicked, squirmed and twisted, and twisted, squirmed, and kicked. He felt his coat tear and of course the skin with it, but he kept right on, for now he was hanging almost free. Hooty had started down now, so as to get a better hold. Danny gave one more kick and then—he felt himself falling!Danny Meadow Mouse shut his eyes and held his breath. Down, down, down he fell. It seemed to him that he never would strike the snow-covered meadows! Really he fell only a very little distance. But it seemed a terrible distance to Danny. He hit something that scratched him|['1.

Danny lay still as Peter Rabbit tended to his injuries. Danny explained how he had been caught by Hooty the Owl because he forgot to watch the sky. He worried about getting back home to his warm grass house, safe tunnels under the snow, and his seeds in the old fence-post. Peter Rabbit advised him to stay in the safe Old Briar-patch, where he could be protected from predators like Granny and Reddy Fox or Roughleg the Hawk. Peter assured Danny that they could make tunnels under the snow and find plenty of seeds to eat. Peter then left to explore the young peach orchard, his mouth watering at the thought of the tender bark on the peach trees.

Peter Rabbit found himself in a troublesome situation without realizing it. By stripping off the bark from a young peach tree, he unintentionally killed it. The bark carries vital sap that nourishes the tree, and Peter's actions prevented the tree from growing. Unaware of the consequences, Peter continued his mischief until a sudden roar startled him. It was Bowser the Hound, chasing him. Panicked, Peter sought refuge in a stone wall in Farmer Brown's peach orchard. He stayed hidden as Farmer Brown and his son worked to protect the trees. Curiosity got the better of Peter, and he ventured out at night to inspect the trees. To his dismay, wire netting now shielded the trunks, preventing him from indulging in more bark. Despite the danger, Peter's curiosity led him to investigate further before heading back home.|"[""1.
