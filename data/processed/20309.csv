Bunny Brown and his sister Sue were having fun in their backyard after a big snowstorm. They were busy building a snowman with the fluffy white flakes from the storm. Bunny was shaping the snowman's nose while Sue watched. Bunny joked about making the nose big to hit it with snowballs. Sue got concerned, thinking about their pet monkey, Wango, and didn't want the snowman to get hurt. Bunny assured her that snowmen can't feel.

Bunny and Sue were thrilled with the jubilee celebration. There was dancing and funny antics by the men and boys. Bunny and Sue learned that in the past, hoe cakes were baked on clean field hoes, but now they are made in pans. The food was rich, so Mrs. Brown limited Bunny and Sue's portions. They found the food delicious. They did not try 'possum meat, a Southern delicacy. After the feast, there was singing, playing, and dancing. Bunny and Sue had to go to bed early, but they enjoyed the sounds of the celebration from afar. The family was traveling to Orange Beach in Florida, where Mr. Brown had business. Bunny hoped to see alligators in the nearby river. As they journeyed south, the scenery became greener, entering a region without snow or ice. Mr. Brown shared about the everglades, vast swamps in southern Florida. The children observed the landscapes from the train as they headed towards their destination.|"['1.

Mr. Brown and his family had a short stop in Clayton while waiting for their next train to Orange Beach. The children, Bunny and Sue, were excited about the train ride but also welcomed the chance to stretch their legs.

Neither Bunny nor Sue could reach the thin, crying cat stuck in the freight car's open door. Sue comforted the cat, hoping it understood their kind words. Cats and dogs know when people are kind. Bunny climbed onto a box to reach the cat, reluctantly entering the dark car. Inside, the cat hesitated, wary but wanting to be petted. Sue followed Bunny inside. The children cautiously approached the cat, trying to lure it with hissing sounds. The cat darted away each time they got close. Suddenly, the train started moving, surprising Bunny and Sue.

Sue and Bunny found themselves in a dark, empty freight car after the door slid shut unexpectedly. They had unknowingly climbed into a car that was being prepared to be loaded again by the railroad workers. The sudden jolt of the freight engine had trapped them inside. Sue's initial fear turned to joy when she realized their cat, who had joined them, was safe and purring in her arms. The children sat on the floor, comforting the cat and each other in the darkness. Bunny softly petted the cat while Sue made a cozy lap for it. Despite the unexpected situation, the siblings found comfort in each other's company and the presence of their furry friend.|"[""1.

Bunny, alongside Sue and the kitten, attempted to navigate the swaying freight car towards a crack of light near the door. The car had two sliding doors, one they entered through and another opposite. Bunny realized the opposite door was firmly shut. Despite the train's speed causing the car to sway intensely, Bunny decided to crawl to reach the door. He faced challenges, like getting a splinter in his hand, but he persevered.

"Bunny and Sue noticed a scruffy man approaching them from the corner of the freight car. In the dim light peeking through the door crack, they saw he was a ragged tramp.

Nutty shared how he found Toddle in the fields and kept him close. The children's initial concern turned into relief as they learned more about Nutty and his furry friend.

Mr. Parker suggested a water tank stop as the best option. He explained that some tanks were in remote areas, and the children would be looked after by the pumpman or switchman if they got there, with no means of communication. Mrs. Brown hardly slept that night, unlike Bunny and Sue. The next morning, a telegram from Mr. Black through Mr. Sweeney revealed the children's location. The joyous reunion took place at the small railroad station near Mr. Black's home. Bunny and Sue waited for their parents as Mr. Black cared for them. After thanking Mr. Black, Mr. Brown remarked on their worry. The Browns visited Mrs. Black to express gratitude before continuing their journey to Orange Beach. The family settled in for the night, with Bunny and Sue sleeping through a minor train collision. The next day, they learned about the accident and continued their journey to Orange Beach, a picturesque village with fruit groves owned by Mr. Halliday.|"['1.

Mr. Halliday explained that the pleasant smell Bunny and Sue noticed was from the orange blossoms in his groves. The children were amazed to see the orange trees and the workers picking the ripe fruit. The workers used ladders to reach the top branches and filled bags with the golden oranges. The filled bags were emptied into boxes scattered around the trees. Bunny and Sue were excited to explore and were reassured that there were no alligators in the nearby river. The children mistook a floating log for an alligator, but Sue clarified it was just a log. The siblings then continued their adventure along Squaw River, marveling at the palm trees and Spanish moss hanging from the branches.|['1.

The kids had a great time exploring the palm trees and smelling the orange blossoms. They couldn't believe that just a week ago they were playing in the snow. Bunny led Sue to the riverbank where they found a pile of boards and logs. Bunny suggested making a raft and sailing down the river. Sue agreed, and Bunny gathered the materials needed. They decided to build a raft and have an adventure. Bunny had learned how to make a raft from Bunker Blue and had experience with boats from his father's dock. They worked together to construct a raft using the logs and boards they found. Despite not informing their parents, Bunny and Sue were excited to set sail on their handmade raft.|"['1.

"Bunny and Sue were used to sailing with their family on Sandport Bay and the real ocean, so Squaw River felt small to them. Building the raft turned out to be more challenging than Bunny expected, but he had all the necessary tools nearby. After securing their lunch on the bank, Bunny started working on the raft. Sue helped lay the boards while Bunny nailed them together. They planned to sail downstream to a ""pirate island."" Bunny remembered how his father used rollers to launch boats, so they used the same technique to get the raft into the river. With some effort, they successfully floated the raft and tied it to the shore to prevent it from drifting away.

The two children found themselves on a raft, using poles to push through the shallow river. They carried a bag of lunch with dried bread, cake, and a flattened pie. Drifting down Squaw River among orange groves, the children enjoyed the shade of trees and the songs of birds. Bunny had made a sturdy raft with orange crates for seats. As they ate, the raft gently swayed, and suddenly, they hit an island in the river. Bunny and Sue were excited as they realized they had reached an island surrounded by water. The children were safe barefoot on the raft, enjoying their adventure.|['Question 1:\nWhat were the children using to push through the shallow river?\nA) Oars\nB) Paddles\nC) Sticks\nD) Poles\nE) Nets', 'Question 2:\nWhat did the children have in their bag of lunch?\nA) Apples and bananas\nB) Dried bread, cake, and a flattened pie\nC) Sandwiches and chips\nD) Candy and soda\nE) Pizza and cookies', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Bunny use to make the raft?\nA) Logs\nB) Rocks\nC) Orange crates\nD) Plastic bottles\nE) Metal sheets', 'Question 4:\nWhat happened as the children were eating on the raft?\nA) It started raining heavily\nB) The raft capsized\nC) The raft gently swayed\nD) They saw a shark in the water\nE) They fell asleep', 'Question 5:\nWhat did the children hit while on the raft?\nA) A tree branch\nB) Another raft\nC) A rock\nD) An island\nE) A fish', 'Question 6:\nHow did Bunny and Sue feel when they realized they had reached an island?\nA) Scared\nB) Confused\nC) Bored\nD) Excited\nE) Annoyed']|['D) Poles', 'B) Dried bread, cake, and a flattened pie', 'C) Orange crates', 'C) The raft gently swayed', 'D) An island', 'D) Excited']
The children had anchored their make-believe raft on the sandy shore of the island. Bunny secured it to a tree to prevent it from floating away. Carrying their lunch, they explored the quiet island, larger than expected. Bunny worried about Sue feeling lonely due to the stillness. To keep her entertained, they walked along the island's edge looking for alligators. Sue, wary of her bare feet, was ready to run if she spotted one. As they reached the far end without seeing any, Sue suddenly spotted alligators crawling onto the island. Bunny and Sue cautiously observed the large, scaly creatures basking in the sun. Despite their curiosity, the children wisely stayed away, keeping a safe distance from the intriguing but dangerous alligators.|['1.

Once upon a time, while the children were playing on the island, some alligators emerged from the river and basked in the sun near the shore. Bunny and Sue, feeling scared, saw the creatures swimming in the water they had just crossed. Sue cried for her mother, and Bunny comforted her, dropping his stick meant for protection. As some alligators approached, a man rowed towards them, revealing that the alligators were his and had escaped. The man, Mr. Bunn, assured the children that the alligators were harmless and explained that he raised them nearby. He promised to retrieve them and offered to row Bunny and Sue home, relieved to have found his missing 'gators.|"['1.

Later, Mr. Bunn rowed Sue and Bunny up the river. Sue wasn't scared anymore, even with alligators in the water. They felt safe in the boat. Mr. Brown thanked Mr. Bunn for saving them and invited him for supper. Everyone cleaned up and sat down to eat. They shared their adventures, and Mr. Bunn talked about raising alligators. He mentioned losing his nephew's oil stock certificate up North. Mr. Bunn thought he'd never see it again. But, to everyone's surprise, Sue found it in the boat! Mr. Bunn was overjoyed. He wanted to reward the children but their mother declined. Eventually, he sent them a small alligator as a pet. Bunny and Sue visited Mr. Bunn's alligator farm and saw many alligators.
