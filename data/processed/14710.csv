"""Who will remove my riding boots?"" he inquired, throwing himself into a seat, extending his legs, and admiring his new spurs. Wili and Lili jumped up eagerly, happy to do something outside of their usual lessons. Each grabbed a foot and pulled so hard that Jule started slipping from his chair. Before he could react, he clutched the chair's side, causing it to move along the floor. He quickly exclaimed, ""Stop! Stop!"" Little Hunne joined in, trying to help by holding onto the chair from behind and pushing back with all his might. Despite their efforts, they ended up sliding along the floor like they were on a sled. Wili and Lili were determined to finish the task, continuing to pull with all their might. Jule promised his mother to do better in the future, seeing the situation from a different perspective as a chance for the twins to be helpful. His mother warned him to behave better. Lili was sent downstairs to practice piano, Wili back to studying, and Jule was asked to entertain the little one. Uncle Titus and his wife heard the commotion and closed their windows.

In the midst of a hot day, Wili and Lili had a grand idea to recreate life on Noah's ark. They envisioned using a wash-tub as their vessel, with their pets, Schnurri and Philomele, playing the animals. Philomele, the cat, and Schnurri, the dog, had a peculiar friendship. Philomele would switch between being affectionate and suddenly scratching Schnurri, causing him to growl. Despite this, they coexisted peacefully most of the time. Wili and Lili were engrossed in their imaginative play, planning their voyage on the makeshift ark. Their governess assumed they were playing with doll clothes but little did she know the twins had embarked on a grand adventure of their own creation.

To prepare for their ark-voyage, Lili and Wili needed water. Lili remembered how water flowed into the wash-house through a log when they did the laundry. They decided to use a long spout to lead water to the wash-house floor, creating a pond for their tub-ark. The challenge was getting the spout in place. They debated asking Battiste or Trine for help. Battiste was experienced but Trine was more open to new ideas. Despite Trine's jealousy of Battiste, they asked him since he was in charge. Lili found Battiste arranging seeds and requested his assistance. Trine showed them how to set up the spout, allowing water to flow into the wash-house. With the ark afloat, they pretended to be Noah and his wife, enjoying their voyage on the rising floodwaters in the wash-house.|"['1.

Soon Schnurri grew restless and made the tub roll dangerously. The water was deep, causing fear. The children cried for help, feeling like they were drowning.
