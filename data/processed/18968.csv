"One evening, Mary, her mother, and Willie sat by the window ready to start a story. Mary recalled an adventure flying a kite with her brother and Master White. Excited, Master White suggested they fly the kite high in the blue sky. They all jumped up, ran to a meadow, and prepared the kite. Master White carefully unfolded the tail and raised the kite into the air, running down the slope shouting for it to rise. The kite soared high, and they cheered. However, as the wind picked up, they had to slowly bring the kite down. Suddenly, a strong gust swept the kite sideways, causing a bit of chaos. ""Bless my heart!"" exclaimed James White."|"['1.

We all sprang up from the grass as James White urgently called for help to hold the struggling Kite. The wind played with the Kite, making it dip and rise as if in a dance. Despite our efforts to pull it down, the Kite dragged us along the meadow slope. James White refused to let go, determined not to be defeated. Eventually, the string broke, and the Kite soared towards the sky, flying erratically over fields towards tall trees. It swooped down into the top of a tree, knocking over a rook's nest. James White, undeterred, climbed the tree and retrieved the Kite, planning to repair it. We found five young rooks among the apples and nuts, which we cared for until they were ready to fly free.|"['1.

The family embarked on a grand steamer, marveling at its immense size. Inside the ship, they explored the elegant saloon, bustling with people. Exhausted, they retired to their cabin with unique bunk beds stacked against the walls. The rhythmic thumping of the engine lulled them to sleep as the vessel glided down the river towards the open sea. The next morning, the children awoke to the ship's vibrations and the sight of ships and sails in the sparkling sunlight. They eagerly dressed and rushed to the deck to witness the vast expanse of the sea. Breakfast was a joyous affair with their parents before they ventured out to catch glimpses of Yarmouth and the captivating coastal scenery.

There was a lot of excitement on the ship as they neared Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland. The city looked stunning from the sea, surrounded by hills of various shapes and covered with trees. As they approached, a loud gun startled everyone, causing some to scream. Charlotte and Helen were not fans of the noise, but Robert found it exciting. Upon landing at a beautiful pier, the group enjoyed the green grass, trees, animals, and a garden full of fruits and flowers. However, the highlight was a small river running alongside the garden. The river usually allowed for easy crossing on stones, but heavy rain one day transformed it into a wide, raging waterway, surprising the children as they watched from their window. The wooden bridge was swept away, and the water continued to rise, causing the animals to seek higher ground.|"['1.

After the rain finally stopped, the children, well-prepared with warm clothes and sturdy shoes, ventured out to get a closer look at the aftermath. They encountered the gardener rushing to salvage his stack of pea-sticks, but it was too late as the stack was already drifting away. As they observed the scene, various items floated down the water, including trees, branches, and broken structures. Amidst the chaos, they noticed a large covered basket floating towards them. Little Robert attempted to reach it with a pole, and with the gardener's help, they retrieved the basket. Inside, they found a cradle covered with white cloth. The gardener speculated that it must have come from a village upstream. Upon opening the cradle, they discovered a baby who began to cry. The children, along with the nurse, comforted and cared for the baby, bringing warmth and nourishment to soothe it. Meanwhile, they also attended to their worried cat, providing milk and reassurance. Later, they heard shouts from the riverbank and rushed to see a group of people. It turned out to be the relieved parents of the baby, reunited with their child thanks to the children's efforts. The mother embraced her baby in tears of joy, grateful for the safe return.|['1.

There was a Milk-maid named Sally who lived on a farm. She woke up early, took her milk-pail and stool, and went to milk the cows. Each cow had a name: Dapple, Brindle, Frisky, and Maggie.
