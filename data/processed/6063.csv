Danny explained that the dog did not belong to the circus but to Mr. Peterson from Millville. Mr. Peterson had lost his trick dog and was offering a reward.

Freddie thought his mom might need him, but Bert understood and let him water the flowers. After that, Freddie pretended to be a firefighter, saving houses with a hose. Flossie tried too, but the dog didn't cooperate at first. The dog did other tricks like standing on hind legs and saying prayers, but wouldn't jump over water. However, the dog enjoyed getting wet, showering Freddie and Flossie in the process. Despite the mishap, Mrs. Bobbsey made them stay in. The Bobbsey twins missed their playmates, and Mr. Bobbsey had to write to find their lost pet and cup. Mr. Peterson's small poodle was lost, not Snap, so the children could keep him. Mrs. Bobbsey was relieved that school was starting again, and the Bobbseys headed to school with other children, all reminiscing about their fun vacations. The principal and teachers expected the students to settle into their studies soon after the break.|"['1.

Danny, after successfully playing a trick, quickly left when he spotted Mr. Tetlow approaching. The Bobbsey twins were so focused on squirting water that they didn't notice the principal until he was near. Startled, they heard him call out sharply. Later, Mr. Tetlow found Flossie and Freddie in his office, watching other children head to class. They had shed a few tears but had calmed down. Apologizing for suspecting them, Mr. Tetlow instructed George to fetch Danny Rugg. Bert didn't fight Danny but warned him sternly. School days for the twins were a mix of lessons and fun, with tasks getting a bit harder. As October neared its end, the twins eagerly anticipated Winter and Christmas. Thanksgiving promised joy and good food, with special guests invited over. The children were excitedly preparing for a fun gathering.|['1.

At the birthday celebration, the children played a fun game called the potato scramble. Each player had to use a large spoon to pick up potatoes one by one and pile them at the far end of the room. Charley Mason won the game and received a prize. The party was beautifully decorated with flowers, pretty glasses, and candles. The highlight was the two large cakes with the children's names on them. However, there was a disappointment when it was discovered that the ice cream was missing. Dinah, the cook, explained that the ice cream had leaked out on the porch. Bert and his friends investigated, but the ice cream was nowhere to be found.

"""Boys, look here, see these water spots from the tub that holds the tin freezer? The drips lead down the steps where the ice cream was taken,"" Mrs. Bobbsey said. As Bert and his friends searched, they followed the trail of water till it vanished in the grass. Suddenly, a loud snap and fleeing footsteps in the dark startled them.

"""Isn't it?"" asked Bert, politely. ""Why, it just matches the others on your coat, and it's got a few threads in the holes, and there are some threads in your coat, just where the button was pulled off. I guess it's your button, all right, Danny.""

""Wait a minute,"" said Bert. ""Suppose I say that this button was found in our freezer of ice cream, that you and some other boys took off our stoop the night of Flossie's and Freddie's party, Danny? What about that?""

Later, Bert found out that Danny and some boys had taken the ice cream freezer from their porch to the old barn. They were caught eating the cream by Bert and his friends, leading to a fight between Danny and Bert.

A few days before Thanksgiving, Mrs. Bobbsey came to the sitting room where the four twins were discussing their Christmas wishes. Thanksgiving at the Bobbsey home was celebrated like never before. There was a grand feast with a big turkey, celery, pies, nuts, candies, cranberry sauce, and plum pudding. Uncle and Aunt Bobbsey, along with other relatives and friends, joined in the festivities. After the holidays, the Bobbseys returned to school. Nan and Bert, in a higher grade, found their new teacher and lessons challenging at first but eventually excelled. The school was preparing for an examination by the Board of Education, and Mr. Tetlow warned against smoking, especially for young boys, due to its harmful effects and potential dangers.|['1.

After Mr. Tetlow left, the boys in Danny's room whispered anxiously among themselves. Nan, distracted from her arithmetic by snowflakes outside, sparked excitement in the class. As the snow fell heavier, the students grew restless, eager to go out and play. The teacher, noticing their distraction, urged them to focus on their lessons. Despite the snowball fights and sled preparations after school, Bert and Charley's homemade bob sled, complete with a bell and steering wheel, was the highlight. Laughter filled the air as they dragged their creation to the hill, ready for a fun afternoon in the snow.|"['1.

There was a lot of excitement in the neighborhood as two large sleds were set to race down the hill. Danny's sled was eye-catching with bright colors and a red cushion on top, while Bert and Charley's sled, though not as fancy, was stronger. As the race began, both sleds were neck and neck, but Bert's sled started to gain speed as he steered to the left where the snow was packed better. Even though Danny tried to pass, Bert held his ground and ended up in the lead. Danny, in his frustration, tried to overtake Bert but ended up overturning his sled. The coasting continued into the evening, and Bert and Charley were praised for their well-made sled. Bert happily recounted his victory at home, while Freddie, still curious about fire engines, listened to the commotion outside.|"[""1.

Bert was getting ready in his room after being woken up by the commotion in the house. He hoped his father would allow him to go see the fire. Determined to be prepared, Bert made sure he was all set before asking. As they reached the street, the fire had grown larger, the flames shooting straight up into the air without any wind. Down by the lake, where there were only a few buildings like boat shelters, the Bobbsey's boathouse was on fire. Despite the flames slowly spreading, the firemen were working hard to put it out. Mr. Bobbsey and Bert realized it was their boathouse on fire. The fire chief found cigarette butts in the living room, suspecting that the fire was caused by someone smoking. Mr. Bobbsey inspected the damage in daylight and discussed the situation with the fire chief, who planned to investigate cigarette sales to minors.|"['1.

One day, Danny's dad, Mr. Rugg, arrived home unexpectedly and heard noises in the barn. Upon investigating, he found Danny and some boys hiding, with the smell of cigarette smoke lingering. Concerned about fire hazards, Mr. Rugg sent the boys home. Later, he discovered empty cigarette boxes in Danny's room, linking him to a past boathouse fire.

It was Saturday, and school was out. Bert was off coasting on his new bob, but Nan stayed back to help with dusting. With the chores done, Nan was free. Mr. Bobbsey was surprised to see his kids in the office. He suggested they go to the railroad office to ask about Snoop. They took a trolley car and arrived at the depot. The agent informed them that some cats were found near the wreck, but none were theirs. On their way back, the trolley car derailed due to snow on the tracks. Mr. Bobbsey mentioned sending a letter ahead to the circus in Cuba. Flossie and Freddie then went sledding near home.
