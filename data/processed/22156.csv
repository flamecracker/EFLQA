Ross and his loyal terrier, Rex, faced a challenging decision on a stormy night. Confronted with a dangerous wash-out, Ross hesitated, recalling his father's warnings. Despite the risks, Rex bravely plunged into the swirling water, prompting Ross to follow. Battling the swift current, Ross and Rex safely crossed to the other side. Wet and cold, they journeyed towards a distant campfire, expecting shelter. To their surprise, they found a group of displaced settlers struggling in the storm. Nearby, men frantically repaired a levee breach. Ross joined the efforts, aiding in reinforcing the levee. Amidst the chaos, Rex's persistent tugging reminded Ross of their initial quest.

"""Off you go,"" said the other kindly. ""But be cautious. Ross, keep an eye on the levee if you're going downstream. If you spot trouble, return quickly. Don't try sitting with your back to a hole like in a storybook. That might work in Holland, but not on the Mississippi."" Rex led Ross down the river briefly, then veered towards low-lying land where his friend Anton lived. The area was flooded, with Anton's house still standing amidst the water. Ross thought of seeking help but remembered the boat they had built years ago. Despite the storm, he found the boat patched up by Anton, and after bailing out the water, he launched it into the flood, knowing the risks but determined to reach Anton's house."|"['1.

Ross bravely pushed the boat through the water, guiding it by wading and using oars. His loyal dog, Rex, eagerly joined the rescue mission by jumping into the boat. As they made their way towards Anton's house, Rex barked excitedly, sensing the importance of their journey. When Ross saw a signal from Anton's window, he knew they were on the right track. Despite the challenging current, Ross and Rex continued their journey. As they approached the house, a tree threatened to block their path. Ross knew he had to act quickly to avoid disaster. With determination, he rowed harder, narrowly avoiding a collision with the tree. In a tense moment, the tree shifted, allowing Ross to continue towards Anton's house, hoping to reach him in time.|"['1.

Ross paused briefly, using the moment to pull harder on the oars, creating a backwater eddy that slowed the current. With a powerful stroke, he managed to steer the boat away from danger just as a massive log surged downstream. The tree's branches nearly capsized the boat, but Ross expertly maneuvered it to safety against the house. Despite the perilous situation, Ross leaped onto the porch and secured the boat, narrowly avoiding disaster. Determined to rescue his friend Anton trapped on the second floor, Ross broke a window and dove into the flooded house. With a mix of swimming skills and bravery, Ross navigated the dark, water-filled room to reach Anton, who was anxiously waiting for help. Together, they faced the challenges of the flood, showing courage and determination in the face of danger.|"['1.

"""Dad,"" Ross called out to his Uncle, explaining that he needed to go with him. The boat was quite full, so he went back to fetch Lassie and her puppies. Lassie was eager to join. As he navigated the slippery, water-covered floor, Ross slipped and fell while trying to gather the puppies. Uncle Jack had disappeared by the time he returned to the porch. The crippled lad, Anton, suggested a plan to rescue Ross using a rope of sheets. Ross tied one end to the door hinge and attached a floating object to the other end. The current carried the makeshift rope around the house corner. Ross realized that his weight might swing the rope away, so he decided to swim back the way he came. Despite a minor injury from a glass splinter, he successfully made his way out of the house."|['1.

Ross faced a problem. The crutch floated just beyond his reach, too far for the boat's rope to reach. Stretching with an oar, he was still four feet away. Jumping to swim for it was risky. He might get pulled away by the current and lose the chance to save his friend. An idea struck him. He tied the boat's rope under his arms, let the boat float, and jumped. He reached the crutch in time, tied the boat to the line, and hauled it back. Ross then caught a basket and a ball of twine dropped from the window. Anton sent their dog, Lassie, down next. She swam to shore, showing her swimming skills.|"['1.

Ross called out for his dog, Lassie, and gently tugged on her collar's string, guiding her back to the boat. Lassie swam towards them as Ross lifted her in. The mother dog then checked on her puppies in a basket on the boat, ensuring they were safe. Suddenly, a loud crack was heard as the house's porch collapsed, followed by the whole structure crumbling. Anton, a lad aboard, got trapped as the house fell towards the water. Ross acted swiftly, rescuing Anton just in time before the house drifted away. As they rowed to safety, the sun emerged, revealing the devastation left behind.

Ross understood the gravity of the situation as he saw his friend Anton devastated by the loss of his beloved books. Ross suggested heading to the camp first due to the flood making it impossible to cross directly. Despite being exhausted, they embarked on the journey, with their loyal dog Rex providing cheerful company. Ross carried the rescued puppies while Anton, struggling with his crutch in the soft, bog-like ground, bravely followed. The rain had stopped, but the sky remained heavy. Ross, half-asleep and wading through deep water, needed Anton's help to stay on course. The journey was arduous, with debris in the water indicating the extent of the damage caused by the flood. Eventually, they reached drier land, both utterly drained. Ross insisted on carrying the puppies, showing unwavering support for his friend. Anton recounted their rescue in a makeshift boat, but even the excitement couldn't mask his physical exhaustion. The Weather Man advised them to rest and eat, showing care for the tired boys.|"['1.

Neither Ross nor Anton could eat much despite their hunger. The hot drink made them even sleepier. Ross fell asleep with food in hand, and Anton was nodding off. The laborer carried Anton to a shed for rest. The Forecaster waited to wake them. Anton woke easily, but Ross struggled due to exhaustion. After a cold water splash, Ross felt rejuvenated. The Forecaster assured them of food supply for the homeless. They were directed to a big tent for help. The Forecaster informed Ross about his father's safety. The boys set off down the levee.

"""Hello, students! Did you know that the air above your head weighs a lot? The Weather Forecaster explained to Anton that we carry a column of air on our heads, which can be as high as sixty miles! Even though we can't feel it, our bodies are used to this weight. The atmosphere's movements, like cyclones and anti-cyclones, affect our weather. An anti-cyclone usually means good weather, as seen in rising barometric columns. The thin air high up is why shooting stars glow. Water vapor in the air forms clouds, leading to rain, hail, or snow. The Weather Forecaster mentioned that predicting weather far ahead is tricky due to many factors like land formations, earth's movements, and different surfaces modifying the atmosphere. He compared this complexity to dropping marbles and trying to predict the pattern they make, showing how unpredictable weather can be."""|['1.

The Weather Man explained to Anton the complexity of predicting weather due to numerous factors involved. He compared exploring weather to exploring distant lands, emphasizing the importance of weather warnings in saving lives and preventing financial losses. The Weather Bureau issues short-range predictions, mostly within a week, except for extreme events like hurricanes or floods. The Forecaster shared a heartwarming story about a circus lending their tent, food, and cooks to help those in need after a flood. The circus performers, including clowns, volunteered to assist, lifting spirits and making the relief efforts more effective.

Rex, unlike the others, felt a fierce protectiveness over Lassie and the puppies. When the massive elephants approached, Lassie growled low, alerting everyone. Rex, with a tense silence that Ross recognized as a warning sign, immediately charged towards the elephants in a defensive stance. Ross's quick commands were the only thing that brought Rex back. Throughout breakfast, Rex remained vigilant, growling loudly each time the elephants passed with their heavy sand-loaded sleds. Anton, curious about the Mississippi River's frequent floods, sought answers. Ross, a knowledgeable man, explained that the Mississippi is prone to flooding due to the vast area it drains, nearly two-fifths of the United States. The river's mud bottom makes it susceptible to erosion, necessitating levees to prevent yearly flooding, a crucial task for the country.|['1.

The Forecaster explained that the speed of a river affects how much sediment it can carry. A fast-flowing river can hold more sediment without it sinking, while a slow river allows sediment to drop. He used the example of stirring mud in water; if left still, the finest particles settle last. The Weather Man added that larger particles sink first due to less surface area. This process has shaped the land over thousands of years, with fertile fields near rivers. Ross suggested building higher levees, but the Forecaster explained that the river's bends cause erosion, forming bars that hinder navigation. This natural process shows how rivers shape the landscape over time.|"['1.

The expert explained that building a heavy wall directly on the riverbank would lead to the water undermining the wall and causing it to collapse. He pointed out that the Mississippi River is too wide and varied for a simple wall to control its flow effectively. The expert proposed a gradual and continuous improvement of the levee system, taking into account the tributaries and rainfall in the basin.

The weather expert explained that predicting floods involves considering the history of rainfall. He illustrated that if the ground is dry, heavy rainfall may be absorbed, but if the ground is already wet, even a little rain can lead to flooding. The Forecaster emphasized the importance of diligent weather observers in preparing for disasters. He encouraged Anton to become a weather observer, highlighting the responsibility and honor it carries. The Forecaster likened the duty of a weather observer to that of a soldier on guard duty.

On a cold day, a rubber ball has room and doesn't squeeze, keeping the ink in. But on a hot day, when rails close, the ball squeezes, making the ink squirt up the tube. By measuring how much the ink rises, you can see how close or far apart the rails are due to heat. This is like a thermometer. The bulb at the bottom contains a substance that expands with heat. Quicksilver is used in hot places as it doesn't boil unless very hot; alcohol is used in cold places as it doesn't freeze unless very cold. The colored alcohol helps see the movement. The thin tube shows even slight changes in temperature. Different time zones are like this too. Eastern Time is east of a line through Buffalo, Wheeling, Asheville, and Atlanta. Central, Mountain, and Pacific Time are further west. Railways and states agree on time for travel and communication, making it important to coordinate time zones.|"['1.

The experienced Weather Man explained to the Forecaster and the boys how to determine true noon using shadows. He emphasized that when the sun casts the shortest shadow, it is at the meridian, which is the halfway point between the longest and shortest shadows. By marking the shadow's position on circles and bisecting lines, they could establish the meridian plane accurately. This method would help them create a reliable sun clock that would not require any adjustments, unlike traditional clocks.

"Before the invention of clocks, people used sun-dials to tell time. Even after clocks became common, sun-dials were still used because of their reliability and cost-effectiveness. Making a sun-dial is simple. By using a pole as the style or upright of a sun-dial, you can determine the time accurately. For instance, the angle between noon and eleven o'clock can be calculated based on your latitude. With a watch, aligning the shadow cast by the sun at different times on a marked circle will give you an accurate timepiece.

Sunsets vary in appearance, but when described one after another, they appear similar, especially on clear days. As the sun sets with few clouds, the lowest part of the sky changes colors. In the west, it transitions from white to yellow, while the north and south show a dull yellow turning brighter. The east shifts from dirty yellow to a dull purple. The colors are less intense at the horizon. After the sun sets, the sky darkens, with yellows turning into oranges, and a purple glow appears. Clouds change from light yellow to dark orange. Sometimes, a faint purple arch appears in the east, while a clearer one is seen in the west. Mr. Levin, with his boys and puppies, joins the discussion on the accuracy of the sunset colors, praising the detailed description.|['1.

The Weather Man explained to the boys how the colors of the sunset can help predict the weather. He mentioned that rain can't fall without dust, and every raindrop has a grain of dust in it. The colors of the sunset are also influenced by dust particles reflecting light and water vapor. A red sunset indicates small bits of dust, while a gray sky in the morning signals large water droplets reflecting light of all colors. The formation of droplets in the afternoon is due to cooling, while at night, it's caused by heat loss through radiation. A gray morning sky means dry air above water droplets, suggesting a fine day ahead. The boys learned about the role of dust particles and moisture in the atmosphere in predicting weather patterns.|['1. What did the Weather Man explain about the colors of the sunset?\nA.

The sun's light appears bluish-white, similar to blue stars. White light is a mix of various colors, each created by different light waves with varying lengths. Short waves like blue are easily scattered by dust particles, while long waves like red pass around them. Imagine a big steamboat and a small canoe on choppy waves; the red wave is the boat, and the blue wave is the canoe, showing how different waves interact with particles. During fog or sunset, more dust in the air scatters blue light, creating a golden hue. The sun's disappearance below the horizon is due to refraction, causing a pink glow from the scattered rays. The Irishman reminisces about spectacular sunsets, possibly influenced by the Krakatoa volcanic eruption in 1883, which caused global atmospheric effects.|"[""1.

Pumice and ashes fell thick over the sea near the island, creating a walkable surface within three miles. The ashes even reached five hundred miles away, forming a scum on the sea. Fine dust and icy particles from condensed vapor rose to extreme heights, circling the world in fifteen days. Sunsets turned red due to dust at great heights from the volcanic outburst. It took three years for the dust to settle, enhancing sunsets. The Mont Pelé eruption in 1902 led to stunning sunsets in America for months. The Weather Man discussed racial inclusion, emphasizing helping all Americans regardless of color. Suggestions were made to involve colored artists in creating plates for subscriptions. Collaboration with a Negro college's lithographing plant was proposed. The Forecaster encouraged engaging with the colored minister for progressive initiatives among the Negroes.|"['1.

The Weather expert explained how the colors of sunsets can reveal important information, like the Krakatoa eruption causing red sunsets for three years. These red sunsets were a result of volcanic dust in the upper atmosphere. This dust cloud led to a decrease in sunlight, affecting crop growth and causing famines, like the 'Three Year Freeze' after the Asama eruption in Japan. The Forecaster highlighted how weather knowledge could have changed history, like Napoleon's ill-fated Russian campaign in 1812. Eruptions in the years leading up to the campaign caused a lack of forage, leading to disease outbreaks and horse deaths within Napoleon's army. Understanding weather patterns and their effects could have altered the course of historical events.|"['1.

The Russian army, recognizing Distance as their key ally, retreated without engaging in battle. Napoleon's forces pressed forward, but the Cossacks, mounted on well-fed horses, encircled the French army, decimating small groups at the front and rear. The French cavalry, hindered by exhausted or dying horses, couldn't retaliate. Amid a scorching summer devoid of spring, the troops advanced through vast wilderness, traversing desolate plains and marshes. The expansive Russian army remained elusive. The French, dwindling from a hundred thousand to seventy thousand horses, faced barren lands devoid of sustenance. The soldiers marched through desolate landscapes, pursued by hunger and fatigue. Napoleon's hopes were briefly revived upon sighting the town of Smolensk, only to find it deserted and devoid of provisions. The march continued towards Moscow, with each passing day bringing greater hardships and losses.|"[""1.

The Russians finally made a stand against the French army at the great battle of Borodino. The French, though superior in numbers, did not secure a final victory. As the red sun rose the next morning, the French army found Moscow burned and desolate. The Russians, retreating and waiting for winter, grew stronger. The French faced hunger and cold, camping outside the city with no fire to cook. The days grew shorter, and the red sunsets continued. Then, in the dead of night, Moscow was set ablaze by the Russians, engulfing the city in flames. The French army faced a harsh reality in a city stripped of resources and consumed by fire.|"[""1.

In a chaotic scene, the French army faced a relentless pursuit by the Russians. Trapped between a fiery inferno and a river turned street, the French Grand Army was forced into a desperate retreat. As they fled, a harsh snowstorm turned their victory into defeat. The bitter cold and lack of supplies left the soldiers starving and freezing. Exhausted, many collapsed along the way. To make matters worse, wolves and Cossacks added to their terrors, attacking the weary soldiers. Despite their heroic efforts, the French army suffered heavy losses. At Smolensk, only a fraction of the once-mighty army remained, with the Russian plains littered with the remains of fallen soldiers. In a valiant yet tragic struggle, Marshal Ney and his men fought bravely but were left with only a handful of soldiers as they continued their harrowing retreat.|"['1.

A meteorologist explained that halos are rarely seen except at specific distances from the sun, around twenty-two to forty-six degrees. These halos are unique, and with practice, one can spot them easily. Another type of cloud, cirro-nebula, resembles cream on a blue sky. Alto clouds are made of moisture drops, while alto-stratus is a thick gray sheet sometimes allowing sunlight through. Lower down are alto-cumulus clouds, resembling blue-gray footballs. Cumulus clouds, like fluffy cotton piles, create shadows in summer. Thunderstorm clouds, called cumulo-nimbus, are heavy masses resembling towers. Nimbus clouds are dark, shapeless layers that bring steady rain or snow. Stratus clouds, like lifted fog, are the last type. Dew-point, the point at which air can't hold more vapor, varies with temperature. Moist climates feel hotter in summer and colder in winter, affecting evaporation and cloud formation.|['1.

In a country with few clouds, like some deserts in the Southwest, there can be extreme temperature changes, up to forty to fifty degrees between noon and midnight. This can lead to sunstroke during the day and chilly evenings under blankets due to the lack of cloud cover to regulate temperature. The upper atmosphere is especially cold, with clouds made of ice crystals. Balloonists have encountered ice crystal clouds, though not as high as upper clouds, using kites for upper-air exploration. A young man, Osborne, known for kite-flying, shared his kite models with the Mississippi League of the Weather, sparking interest in kite-flying and weather observations. The League planned a kite contest to generate funds, highlighting the importance of self-sufficiency.

Snowflakes are fascinating crystals that form in the air. They exhibit various intricate designs like lace, trees, or ferns, all made of six-sided crystals created by water vapor cooling and crystallizing on cold surfaces like glass. Ice crystals grow from each other easily, a phenomenon known as twinning. Wilson A. Bentley from Vermont is a renowned expert on snow crystals, capturing thousands of unique forms through a microscope each year. Snow crystals can vary in shape, from needle-like spicules in the upper atmosphere to solid forms closer to the ground. The Weather Bureau uses instruments like snow gauges to measure snowfall accurately, crucial for flood forecasts and irrigation planning. Snow surveys in northern states help predict water availability for various projects.|['1.

Railroads in snowy regions use snowsheds to prevent avalanches from burying tracks. These structures endure extreme pressures, calculated by the Weather Bureau. Drifting snow is managed using rotary-snow-plows, guided by Bureau data. Frost warnings, crucial for saving millions in crops, are issued by the Bureau. A tale of failed frost protection illustrates the need for advanced warnings. The Weather Bureau's frost alarms, like thermostats, alert farmers of impending frost. They trigger alarms when temperatures near crop-damaging levels. Heating a small air layer above the ground protects lower fruit branches from frost. The cost of fuel for frost protection is minimal compared to potential crop losses. Advanced warnings and targeted heating can save crops economically.|"['1.

An hour later, four boys gathered to analyze weather maps, debating whether to take action. Fred, eager for new challenges, proposed a preemptive move against frost. Ross, League leader, hesitated, fearing a misstep. Anton was convinced frost was imminent. Bob's decision led to mobilization. They planned to warn the county using different methods: Bob would alert operators via wireless, Fred would notify farmers with telephones, Anton would drive to remote areas, and Ross would ride his pony. As they dispersed, Bob's dog, Rex, understood his silent command and raced off. Anton, frail and sent to bed, was replaced by his father. Ross, riding like Paul Revere, faced skepticism but pressed on, pondering his next move. On his way, he encountered a League member with a wireless, prompting a pause in his journey.|"['1.

The farmer agreed to send his potatoes to Chicago the following week, seeking the Forecaster's guidance. Anton suggested involving Mr. Tighe to help with mapping out the journey. The farmer, intrigued by the process, wanted to understand the atmospheric circulation that influences weather changes. Anton explained how the sun's heat causes air to expand and rise at the equator, leading to the formation of winds. The Forecaster elaborated on the trade winds, which blow consistently towards the American coasts. He mentioned how different layers of clouds moving in opposite directions can be observed in the trade winds. Anton clarified that observations from clouds, kites, and balloons help in studying wind patterns, highlighting unique wind behaviors on Teneriffe's Peak.|"[""1.

The weather patterns in the tropical and sub-tropical zones are influenced by three main belts of wind. The first belt consists of light east winds near the equator that shift slightly north or south with the seasons. This belt brings heavy rains and calm conditions known as the 'doldrums.' Sailors often find themselves stuck in this region due to lack of wind. Beyond this lies the trade winds, downflowing easterly currents between the tropics and temperate zones. Further out are the prevailing strong west winds that extend towards the Poles. The United States experiences these west winds, where the eastward movement of weather is consistent due to surface and upper air winds blowing in the same direction. The southern hemisphere has less disruption in wind patterns compared to the north. The 'roaring forties' in the southern hemisphere correspond to the northern United States, where strong west winds dominate. Tom, the League's wind-measurer, notes the consistent southwest or northwest winds in his kite-flying, influenced by different temperature conditions over land and sea. Land absorbs and releases heat quickly, causing variations in temperature that drive winds. The Forecaster explains how continents like Asia experience extreme temperature changes, leading to monsoons and distinct wind patterns. Every region has its unique wind system, influenced by various factors like temperature, landmass, and ocean currents. In the United States, weather generally moves from west to east, guided by complex wind systems affected by seasonal changes, heat differentials, and|"['1.

The Forecaster explained how weather patterns move across the United States. He mentioned that the St. Lawrence Valley is a key route for storms. There are five main storm tracks: one from the Canadian Northwest to the St. Lawrence Valley, another from the Northwest to the Mississippi Valley, a third from the Pacific Coast to the Ohio Valley, a fourth from the southwestern states to the Atlantic coast, and a fifth from the West Indies to the Gulf of Mexico. These tracks influence the weather within a thousand-mile radius. The Forecaster emphasized that understanding these tracks is crucial for weather forecasting. He also clarified the misconception about cyclones, stating that they are cold air movements following low-pressure systems, not violent storms.|['1.

The boy explained that a cyclone is a large whirl in the air, typically between five hundred and a thousand miles wide. It has low barometric pressure at its center and rising pressure at its edges. The winds within a cyclone spiral inward, with those in the United States moving counterclockwise. Winds to the east are southeasterly, those to the north are northeasterly, to the west they are northwesterly, and to the south they are southeasterly, all converging towards the center. As cyclones move along at about four hundred miles a day, predicting their behavior requires detailed analysis, especially considering the impact of mountains and the irregular oval shape of cyclones in America. The Forecaster emphasized that a drop in atmospheric pressure signals a 'low,' leading to expanding warm winds. Conversely, a 'high' or 'anti-cyclone' brings colder winds, resulting in freezing temperatures. The Forecaster mentioned the detailed observations taken at over two hundred official weather stations twice a day to predict weather patterns accurately, with an impressive eighty-two percent accuracy rate in forecasts over the past six years.|['1.

Wind data is crucial for various reasons. In April 1902, a powerful storm swept through the central western states, causing an empty boxcar in Indiana to be moved by the strong winds onto the main railway track. The boxcar traveled for two miles uphill before colliding with a passenger train, resulting in casualties. The railroad company used weather records to prove the storm's unusual intensity, aiming to reduce liability for damages. Weather records are also valuable in legal cases, like a lawsuit involving a Chicago property fire allegedly caused by a locomotive's sparks. The Weather Bureau's records, showing a wind blowing away from the property, helped the railroad company defend against the claims. The United States Supreme Court has recognized weather records as admissible evidence in legal proceedings for many years.|"['1.

Dan'l observed the table under the bright sun, noticing a burning spot caused by the sunlight. He realized that the heat from the sun could scorch objects. Curious, he experimented with a piece of cardboard, discovering that the sun's intensity affected how much it burned the cardboard. Dan'l shared his findings with Mistah Anton, who was impressed by his observation. Dan'l then revealed a special crystal, a sunshine recorder, gifted to the League. The Forecaster praised Dan'l for independently discovering the principle behind the Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder. Dan'l's curiosity and experimentation led to a valuable scientific observation, showcasing the importance of exploration and discovery.|"[""1.

The Weather Forecaster agreed that it would be best for Dan'l to include a recorder in Anton's outfit for his upcoming summer work on sunshine measuring and its relation to the weather. Anton's project was inspired by the late Dr. Major Albert Veeder, a country doctor from Lyons, N.Y., who dedicated his life to studying auroras and sun-spots. Despite being unknown during his lifetime, Dr. Veeder's groundbreaking research was finally recognized posthumously when two meteorologists discovered his work. Dr. Veeder's family shared his unpublished papers, revealing his pioneering contributions to meteorology and astronomy.

Two massive clouds, one white and the other black, clashed in the sky, creating a dramatic scene. The boys observed a strip of blue sky between them before the collision. They discussed tornadoes, explaining the spinning motion and the vacuum-like pressure inside. Suddenly, a tornado formed, lifting from the ground and then retreating back into the sky. The boys took cover as the tornado approached, and they witnessed its destructive force on a nearby barn. Debris flew, and a roof was torn off, crashing to the ground. The boys remembered safety advice and ran for cover as the tornado wreaked havoc. Despite the storm passing, the sky remained ominous, hinting at the power of nature's forces.|"['1.

In the Weather Bureau, the Forecaster's nephew, recovering from hurricane injuries, shared the tragic tale of the Galveston storm of 1900. The hurricane's fury claimed over 6,000 lives on Galveston Island and 5,000 more inland. The storm wave, preceding the hurricane, devastated the city blocks. The Forecaster reflected on the lack of early warnings compared to modern times. As the hurricane approached, the barometer fell, cirrus clouds hinted at the impending disaster, and the Gulf's waters swelled ominously. The city received warnings, but by nine o'clock, the storm struck with relentless force. The wind intensified, reaching 120 miles per hour, causing chaos and destruction. Dr. Cline's account of the harrowing afternoon captured the terror as the hurricane ravaged the city.|"[""1.

The Forecaster explained the devastating impact of a hurricane that hit Galveston. The water rose steadily until a sudden four-foot surge in seconds caused chaos. Many lives were lost, and houses were destroyed. The Forecaster highlighted the importance of weather warnings in saving lives. Fred expressed confusion about hurricanes, unlike tornadoes, they come from the southeast. The Forecaster clarified that hurricanes are tropical cyclones formed by rising air over warm, moist areas. These storms are known as typhoons in the China Sea. The West Indian Hurricanes are one of the five cradles of such storms.

The birthplace of West Indian Hurricanes lies in the North Atlantic, approximately six to eight degrees north of the equator and two hundred to a thousand miles east of the West Indies. These hurricanes start small but grow in both size and intensity as they move westward. Once they reach the Lesser Antilles, near the Virgin Islands, they often intensify into powerful whirlwinds and change course to the northwest, skirting the northern edge of Porto Rico. Most of these hurricanes follow a common path, with about seventy-five percent passing through a storm trail between Bermuda and Charleston. By the time they reach New York's latitude, they transform into violent westerly gales after circling halfway around the region. These storms mainly occur in autumn when the doldrums, their birthplace, are at their peak in the Atlantic. Similarly, Chinese typhoons are most frequent during these months due to the same atmospheric conditions.|"['1.

In the sky, a weak blue hue revealed cirro-stratus clouds resembling mares'-tails. A dull glare at the horizon hinted at an approaching typhoon. Suddenly, a low wind whistle, not like a tornado but a smooth high-speed engine, announced the storm's advance. White squalls with furious winds and rain preceded the hurricane. The sea surged, inching closer to the city as the wind intensified. Throughout the day, the Weather Bureau staff remained vigilant, warning Galveston residents of the impending disaster. Volunteers on motorbikes spread the alarm citywide. Despite the storm's ferocity, the city was prepared, having learned from the tragedy of 1900. In Seabrook, only a few houses survived, as residents heeded warnings.

During a fierce storm, a wall of water approached the island as twilight descended. The wind-lashed waters of the bay turned into tumultuous waves crashing upon the city. The tempest's power intensified, with wind speeds reaching up to a hundred and twenty miles per hour. The hurricane's force was immense, equivalent to billions of tons moving at extreme speeds. The storm wreaked havoc on the city's lower section, demolishing houses. Thanks to early warnings from the Weather Bureau tower, many lives were saved as people evacuated the area. Despite facing perilous conditions, brave individuals risked their lives to secure instruments on the rooftop during the raging storm.

"Near the railway track, a peculiar scene unfolded after a fierce storm. Inside a humble cabin, a grand piano stood on the first-floor, untouched except for warping from water and sun exposure. The cabin lacked furniture but housed the piano mysteriously. Surrounding the cabin were the remains of drowned animals and people, evidence of the storm's devastation. The hurricane of 1915, though deadly, claimed fewer lives due to the Weather Bureau warnings, Galveston residents' bravery, and the sea-wall's construction. The tale captivated young listeners, prompting questions about kite-flying safety during storms.

In a forest, the type of tree you stand under can affect your risk of being struck by lightning. For instance, standing under an oak tree makes you fifty-four times more likely to be struck compared to standing under a beech tree. Lightning may jump from an oak tree to you more easily than from a beech tree. Even trees of similar types can react differently to lightning strikes. Sequoia trees, for example, can withstand lightning strikes better than other trees. They often only lose the top part when struck, while other trees may split or shatter. Lightning can strike structures like the Eiffel Tower frequently, but if properly grounded, it won't cause harm. Thunderstorms form when specific cloud types like cirro-stratus herald their arrival, followed by cumulo-nimbus clouds with their characteristic dark bottoms and billowy white tops.|['1.

The Forecaster explained the science behind thunderstorms to the students. Rainfall brings cold air downward, displacing warm air ahead of the storm. The warm air curves back and rises into the storm cloud, where it condenses into rain. Lightning occurs between cloud masses, with flashes jumping between clouds. Lightning rods on buildings prevent strikes by providing a path for the electrical discharge to the ground. Lightning flashes vary in length and appearance, with irregular, winding patterns. Heat-lightning is caused by discharges between upper and lower clouds, illuminating the lower clouds. Lightning is a fascinating natural phenomenon with various forms and causes.|['1.

Father once shared with me a fascinating story about a ball of fire during a thunderstorm that rolled around the room like quicksilver and exploded when it struck a shovel. Mr. Levin explained that this phenomenon is known as globe or ball lightning, capable of unusual feats like baking biscuits in seconds. These electrical discharges, also called corpse candles or St. John's fires, are often seen on elevated points like ship masts or tree tips. They appear as bluish flames and emit crackling sounds. The Forecaster mentioned that lightning strikes cause around 500 deaths annually in the U.S., with the Western States having the highest fatalities. Lightning incidents vary worldwide, with the plains witnessing more deaths than cities. Notably, a church and an amusement park incident in Chicago highlight the dangers of lightning strikes.|['1.

The observer explained that light travels so fast that it seems instantaneous for something close like lightning, while sound moves at a slower pace of a little over a thousand feet per second. A rifle shot is an explosion that causes air vibrations, just like thunder from lightning, which heats the air and creates an explosion wave. The rumble of thunder is due to different distances of the lightning discharge, echoes, and the irregular shape of the earth. Hail is often electrified in violent storms, causing it to jump up when it strikes the ground. Hail forms in summer thunderstorms when moisture is carried up, coated with snow, and falls repeatedly, growing in size with each layer of ice until it becomes too heavy to stay aloft.|['1.
