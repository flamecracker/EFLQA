"""Yes, I was, but I hated to take back water, so I said that I belonged to a club and that I supposed he was going to have all the clubs in Rosemont represented in some way. He said that was just what they wanted. They wanted every activity in the town to be shown in some shape or other.""

Roger was missing, and the group was puzzled until Ethel Blue's and Della's nuts caught fire. While everyone was mesmerized by the flames, a shriek from the Witches' Cave interrupted them. Dorothy emerged with a spooky tale of a jack-o'-lantern face behind her. Helen guessed it was Roger playing a prank. Suddenly, shouts from the garden diverted their attention to Tom and George wrestling in good spirits. Tom mistook George for his future bride during a game. The group then moved inside to bob for apples. The boys struggled, while the girls made nut boats with candles.

Helen whispered in awe, ""I hear a call from the Witches' Cave,"" as a mysterious wind-like sound echoed, saying, ""Come! Come! Come!"" They cautiously moved towards the dining room, passing through a thicket of branches blocking the door. The room was dimly lit by green flames from burning alcohol and salt. Two figures in black capes and red hats entered, serving cakes called sowens. The children, part of the United Service Club, aimed to help others, starting with the Christmas Ship.

Elisabeth woke up from her nap and smiled at the two girls leaning over her carriage. Miss Merriam brought her some warm food, and after finishing her meal, the Ethels took her out for a walk.

The Rosemont schools closed for the holidays at noon on the Wednesday before Christmas. The Mortons and Dorothy were free to bring Katharine from Hoboken using Mrs. Emerson's car. The family had a tradition of welcoming guests as if they belonged to all of them, not just one member. Helen, Roger, Dorothy, and Dicky joined to meet Katharine at the station.

The Ethels moved upstairs to make room for Katharine in the crowded house. Despite initial discomfort, they all worked together on the Club plans for the Glen Point orphans, forgetting their initial awkwardness.

The large Norway spruce tree stood proudly in front of the school, with a spacious lawn where many people gathered to admire. Choirs from local churches volunteered to sing from an elevated stand, leading the crowd in songs filled with brotherly love and cheer. The atmosphere was so beautiful that words seemed inadequate. A girl found hope in her heart, a pickpocket resisted temptation, and even babies reached out in wonder. The school children sang carols joyfully, their voices blending with the choir's, creating a magical moment. As the stars appeared, people lingered, reflecting on peace.

Children across the United States generously sent Christmas presents to European children affected by the war. Today, let's imagine we're aboard the _Jason_, a ship carrying these gifts to Europe. We need everyone to help. First, we need a captain. The tallest boy near the door was chosen and adorned with a CAPTAIN band. Two more officers were selected in the same way.

At the Emersons' home, there was a joyful exchange of thank yous and laughter as they shared and admired the gifts they had received. Mrs. Smith had sent Mrs. Emerson a unique pair of beautifully decorated wax candles from an Italian candlemaker in New York. Miss Merriam had thoughtfully gifted Mrs. Emerson and Mrs. Morton with tiny brass censers, charcoal, and Japanese incense to add a fragrant touch to their homes. The family had come together to create a special Chautauqua scrapbook for Mrs. Emerson, filled with memories of their summer adventures. Each family member had contributed in their own way, from writing stories to pasting pictures, resulting in a beautiful and cherished gift.

Ayleesabet leaned forward, wrapping her arms around the horse's neck, her hands lost in his whiskers. With a happy chirp, she straightened up, holding her hair like reins. The horse picked up speed, going from a walk to a trot. Elisabeth laughed louder and louder, perfectly in sync with her steed like a Centaur.

The U.S.C. girls worked diligently to create a beautiful banner for the upcoming Fourth of July celebration. They used a heavy curtain pole with a gilt ball as a standard, a cross bar with gilt balls on each end, and a brass clamp to hold it all together. The banner was laced evenly onto the crossbar, and the girls even dyed the cord to match the color scheme. They also refurbished curtain tassels found in their grandmother's attic to match the banner. The result was so impressive that Mr. Wheeler and the teachers admired their work. As the town prepared for the Fourth of July festivities, the U.S.C. boys distributed leaflets on making children's garments fire-proof.
