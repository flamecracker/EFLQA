""And,"" he thought, ""if I've outwitted the dragon, I can probably get the better of his mother!"" So he didn't waste many words about the matter, but set off with the monster. A long, rough road; but still it was too short, since it led to a bad end. It seemed to Stan as if he had arrived almost before he started.The old she-dragon, old as Time itself, was waiting for them. She had made a fire under the huge caldron, in which she meant to boil the milk and mix it with the blood of a lamb and the marrow from its bones, that the liquid might have healing power. Stan saw her eyes glistening in the darkness when they were still three gun-shots off.

The female dragon also grew worried. Imagine that! Is it a jest to find someone capable of tossing anything to the moon? She was a dragon of pure bloodline, yet the following day, she devised an even tougher challenge. They headed to the well, and in a blink, the dragon filled the twelve skins, about to haul them back. Stan was exhausted, barely managing to drag the empty skins. A shiver ran down his spine at the thought of the full ones. What did he do? He grabbed a worn-out knife blade, scratching the earth around the well. In a flash, the dragon uprooted more trees than Stan had ever seen, piling them up. But Stan carefully selected the finest trees, tying them together with grapevines. Without a word, he continued linking one magnificent tree to another. This time, nearing the end of the year's service, it seemed the discussion would never end. Stan was determined to carry the forest on his back. Finally, an agreement was reached. Stan, always quick-witted, had a plan. Seeing the dragon and his mother put out the light, he cleverly placed a pig's trough under the bed, covering it with a coat and pretending to sleep. The dragon, fooled by the ruse, struck the trough instead of Stan's head. Realizing it was futile to argue, the dragons hurried to fill Stan's sacks to be rid of him.

Stan, feeling unwelcome, decided to leave. But before he did, he asked the dragon to carry his treasure home to avoid embarrassment. The road back seemed long, but as Stan neared his house and heard his children, he slowed down, fearing the dragon might follow him. He was unsure how to transport the treasure alone with his numerous children who were eager for dragon meat. Meanwhile, there was an emperor with three sons who struggled to complete a church due to a falling steeple. The emperor sought an architect but dreamt of a magical bird whose nest could finish the church. His sons volunteered to find the bird and help their father.|"['1.

Once upon a time, an emperor had three sons who all desired to fulfill their duty to God by seeking out a wonderful bird. The emperor decided that his oldest son would set out first, followed by the second son if the first did not succeed, and so on. The older sons failed and were turned into stone by a fox they encountered on their journey. The youngest son, after much persuasion, set out to find the bird. He encountered the same fox but, unlike his brothers, he showed kindness and received the bird along with a beautiful girl. The bird, though stunning, was silent until a shepherd entered the church and it sang joyfully. The emperor, thrilled by the singing, discovered the shepherd's heroic qualities and awaited his full story eagerly.|"[""1.

When we arrived at the borders of the next dragon kingdom, we paused to rest. By dawn the next day, we crossed the frontier and reached their palace by noon. It was more stunning than the first. As I dismounted, I went to the stable, while my companion heeded the girl's advice and turned back. The horses were in their cribs, one gazed at me as I interacted with it. I mounted the horse, took the cage with the magic bird, and rode by. The dragons pursued me until my companion intervened, freezing them in place. They pleaded for the horse, and I returned it out of kindness. As we journeyed on, the dragons watched longingly after us. At the other dragon palace, the girl transformed the building into an apple and carried it.

Three brothers set out on a journey and stopped by a pond to cool off. The oldest and the second brother drank from the pond, but when the youngest brother went to drink, his siblings cut off his feet and abandoned him. Left helpless by the pond, a dragon approached, but the youngest brother's loyal horse saved him. The horse suggested a pact of brotherhood, with the blind youngest brother carrying the sighted brother on his back. They sought a scorpion for its healing blood, and the youngest brother used it to restore his feet and the blind man's sight. Seeking justice, the youngest brother proved his innocence through a divine test involving bee-hives. The emperor, amazed by the youngest brother's return and wisdom, celebrated his return and acknowledged the power of doing good deeds.|"[""1.

Many people gathered to watch this trial. After the wedding, the emperor's son married the poultry-maid and then passed the throne to him. Anna, the eldest sister, was so beautiful that the sheep stopped eating when she was near. Stana, the second sister, was so lovely that the wolves guarded the herd when she was the shepherdess. Laptitza, the youngest, had skin as white as milk foam and hair as soft as lamb's wool, combining the beauty of her sisters. One summer day, the three sisters went strawberry picking and heard horse hooves approaching. It was the emperor's son hunting, and soon three weddings were celebrated. After fulfilling their promises, the step-mother tried to deceive the emperor but failed. When the emperor was called to war, leaving his wife, Laptitza's promise was fulfilled, and twin princes were born. The step-mother replaced them with puppies and buried the twins.

As they approached the dense forest surrounding the palace, the prince's horse advised him to hold on tight and press close to its neck to navigate the perilous woods. With a swift leap, they soared over the wild animals that guarded the palace, catching a glimpse of its dazzling beauty.

Upon landing, the prince and his horse inadvertently stirred the forest, causing the animals to howl in protest. Luckily, the mistress of the palace, a gracious fairy, intervened and calmed the beasts. Overwhelmed by her beauty, the prince was welcomed into the palace where he met the fairy's sisters.

Grateful for their rescue, the fairies hosted a lavish banquet for the prince. They allowed his horse to roam freely among the wild animals and invited him to stay with them. Despite their warm hospitality, the prince's heart yearned to see his parents once more.

Once there lived an old couple who had no children to help them in their old age. They struggled to even light a fire after returning from the fields. The old woman left a pot of buttermilk to boil with a mouse guarding it while she worked with her husband. When they returned home, they found the mouse had drowned in the buttermilk. In her sorrow, the old woman smashed her pitcher and went to the empress to tell the tale. The empress, upon hearing it, fell from the balcony, breaking her ankle and passing away. The emperor, grief-stricken, became a monk in a distant monastery. The old man, after traveling the world, returned home wiser but still poor. One day, he found three peas and envisioned a future of wealth by planting them.

Petru stood still as they emerged from the copper forest. Before him lay the Silver Wood, a wondrous sight with glittering bushes and alluring flowers that seemed to speak sweeter than those in the Copper Forest. Despite warnings from the Welwa tied to the bay, Petru couldn't resist weaving a flower wreath. The tempest raged, darkness deepened, and the earth trembled as the Welwa of the Silver Wood attacked with even greater ferocity. A fierce battle ensued for three days and nights until Petru finally tamed the second Welwa at dawn. In the Gold Forest, Petru faced an unprecedented challenge. Encountering a dense fog, he fought blindly, feeling as though he had lost all senses. After a day of relentless battle, the fog lifted, and Petru emerged victorious, feeling reborn in the light of a new day.|['1.

Petru had barely caught his breath when he noticed an unusual sight approaching from the side. It was a strange entity, not quite water but not solid either. It moved in a peculiar manner, leaving no trace and not soaring high. It seemed like nothing yet appeared to be something. The battle resumed, and Petru fought tirelessly, not sure of his target or opponent. As dawn broke on the following day, Petru felt his strength waning. Despite his exhaustion, he readied himself for the advancing foe. The creature, known as Welwa, was beyond description, with features that defied logic. Petru fought valiantly, his energy depleting as night fell, and he eventually found himself dismounted. The Welwa, though fatigued, charged at Petru, who managed to subdue it. As they continued their journey, Petru discarded the copper and silver wreaths, keeping only the gold one. Finally, as the sun set and they reached the forest's edge, Petru's horse came to a halt.|"['1.

As Petru ventured into the realm of Holy Wednesday, the bitter cold pierced through him, freezing even his bones. Despite the tempting fires along the road and the sweet calls of the people by them, he pressed on, showing bravery in enduring the harsh conditions. Holy Wednesday praised his courage and rewarded him with a special casket that could bring news from any place and truthful tidings from his homeland. Moving on to the kingdom of Holy Thursday, the intense heat melted even the iron horse shoes. Petru resisted the allure of cool valleys with beautiful girls and rode on.

Holy Friday, an ancient lady, appeared worn with age, captivating young Petru's gaze. Enthralled, Petru seemed to count every wrinkle on her face, as if casting an Evil eye. Holy Friday shared her tale, revealing her beauty once led to the creation of the earth by her parents. Enchanted by her loveliness, the Evil eye cursed her, causing a wrinkle for each century passed. To show his bravery, Petru was tasked to fetch water from a spring in the Fairy Aurora's kingdom.

Once upon a time, a prince came to a magical river unlike any other. Instead of water, it flowed with milk over gems and pearls. Lions with golden hair guarded its banks, where fairies slumbered on beautiful blossoms. To cross the river, the prince faced a bridge guarded by sleeping lions. But this bridge was no ordinary bridge; it was made of a mysterious material that only looked like a bridge. Undaunted, the prince used his flute to awaken and lull a giant to sleep three times. On the fourth time, he cleverly tied the giant's fingers and woke him up, successfully crossing the river.|"['1.

The prince, Petru, faced a giant in a fierce battle that lasted for three days and nights. Despite the giant's strength, Petru proved to be a formidable opponent. Eventually, Petru overpowered the giant, who conceded defeat. Petru then bound the giant's hands and blindfolded him before leading him to a river where fairies were bathing. The fairies fell asleep upon hearing Petru's flute, allowing him to continue his journey. As he ventured further, Petru marveled at the beauty of a garden with golden trees and clear fountains.

Petru entered the enchanting palace of the Fairy Aurora, surrounded by petrified fairies, golden-leaved trees, and flowers made of pearls and gems. The atmosphere was soothing and sweet, with columns of sunbeams and steps as soft as princesses' couches. The palace had forty-eight rooms, each more lavish than the last, adorned with linen, silk, silver, and gold. In the forty-ninth room, Petru found the slumbering Fairy Aurora on a golden couch. The room was like a grand church, with walls covered in silk and beautiful decorations. Petru was captivated by the beauty around him and held his breath at the sight of the sleeping Fairy Aurora. Twelve fairies slumbered on each side of her couch. As Petru played his flute, the fairies stirred in their sleep, and the palace fell silent once more.|['1.

In a magical garden, Petru encountered the Fairy Aurora asleep. He indulged in the bread of strength and the wine of youth, taking three bites of each. With each bite, the world around him transformed into a more vibrant and joyful place. Petru's journey continued as he hurried away with a jug of water from the fairy's fountain.

The Fairy Aurora was upset because the water was taken. Holy Friday was mad as her jug broke. Brothers Florea and Costan were angry for losing the empire. The box revealed that the old emperor wanted the one who brought water from the Fairy Aurora's fountain to rule. Florea and Costan planned to kill Petru to claim the water and the kingdom.

The fairy queen was filled with sorrow and grief, forgetting her anger. She commanded the Sun to make seven days into one to search and bring tidings. The Fairy Aurora watched the Sun for seven days, tears streaming from her eyes due to great sorrow. When all efforts failed, she cast darkness over her kingdom, commanding no smiles, fragrant flowers, or warm sunbeams. She sent her subjects away, leaving only guards at the bridge. Human life stood still as time ceased to move. The dragons, lions, giants, and fairies vanished. The winds obeyed her, and the sun cast cold rays.
