Children, it's important to learn good manners from a young age. Even I, a Goop, had to learn the hard way by misbehaving before going to school. I broke many rules but eventually reformed. So, when you read about manners, know that I discovered them through my own mistakes. Little Goops can be seen marking on windows, but it's best to rub it out. The meanest trick is pulling a chair from someone sitting down - it's just not funny. When visiting, don't overstay your welcome. Leave just before they tire of you, that's the right time to go. Remember, always maintain eye contact when speaking, unless you're telling a lie. And don't be afraid to look someone in the eye, it shows confidence and respect.|"['1.

When a Goop visits, it's not nice to ask for food and stay without being invited. It's impolite to overstay. A Goop who woke up late couldn't find his things and blamed his mom for making him late. Remember, when someone shares with you, show gratitude and be kind. Don't laugh or speak unkindly. Treat others as you want to be treated. In a dream, flowers begged not to be plucked and thrown away. They forgive but ask for kindness. A Goop hanging behind a cart made me worry. Don't be careless like a Goop.

"If you were penning with your nose, you'd have to huddle up, I guess, and rest your head on your palm; but now, I can't comprehend, for you're jotting with your pen! So sit up straight, and beam once more! You need not frown because you write, nor clutch your fingers very tightly! And if you chew the holder so, they'll mistake you for a Goop, you know! One of them grew cold; said he felt so sick he knew he'd caught a cold, and coughed a lot! The other was so warm he said he enjoyed it stormy! Which of them was Goop, and which was not? Ink, ink! What do you think! You're sure to be stained if you toy with the ink! You're sure to get black if you fiddle with the ink-well, before you start, just pause once, and think well! All over your fingers, all over your face, all over your clothes, and all over the place! Your mother will be mad, your father will say, ""There! I said not to touch it; you said you'd take care!"" Everyone liked Ezekiel. Why? You could hardly find his match. Why? If he made an error, he admitted he was wrong; if he ran an errand, he wasn't gone long; he never would bully, even though he was strong! Everyone disliked Mello. Why? He"|"['1.
