Jarwin was unusually quiet and gloomy that day. He kept his thoughts to himself, making it hard to know what troubled him.

The next morning, he and Cuffy had a cold bath, followed by a breakfast of chestnuts, plums, and seafood. Jarwin caught shrimp with a makeshift net.

Jarwin and his faithful dog found themselves adrift on a raft in the vast Pacific Ocean. The wind shifted, carrying them away from the hoped-for island. As the sun set, the wind died down, allowing them to share a meal and rest. However, a violent squall interrupted their sleep, drenching them but causing no harm. Jarwin then prepared for rough weather by using a piece of canvas as a makeshift shelter. The following days were tumultuous with gales and high waves, making survival a challenge. When the storm finally subsided, Jarwin spotted a distant vessel and desperately signaled for help. With a mix of hope and anxiety, they awaited the ship's response, clinging to the possibility of rescue in the vast expanse of the ocean.|"['1.

When the castaway was only a short distance from the raft, he noticed a person on the vessel's side aiming a telescope at him. Overwhelmed with relief, he chuckled and greeted the figure. Suddenly, it dawned on Jarwin that the commander of the unfamiliar ship had no intention of helping him. Frustrated and disheartened, he bellowed a defiant roar and shook his fist at the departing schooner. To his amazement, the schooner changed course and approached him directly. Soon, it pulled up alongside, and its sails were adjusted. Jarwin found himself on the pristine white deck of a well-maintained vessel that seemed more like a pleasure yacht. As he approached the stout man who seemed to be in charge, Jarwin expressed gratitude for being rescued, along with his dog, Cuffy. The man, with a mix of rough language and manners, revealed that he was a trader and presented Jarwin with a choice - to agree to his terms or be left behind.

John Jarwin, a seaman with a simple heart, thought the captain needed a versatile worker for any task, whether on the ship or ashore. The captain, however, seemed to interpret it differently. He nodded to a seaman to cut the raft loose. As the raft disappeared, Jarwin sat down and shared his story with his new rough companions. Their rough language and behavior hinted at a strained relationship with the captain. When Jarwin inquired about their trade, he faced laughter and curses. Feeling uneasy, he decided to leave the vessel soon. Approaching the captain for answers, he was met with threats and learned the captain's stern ways.

Jarwin, a sailor, gazed at an island from the ship. He thought of swimming to it but worried about being caught. With his loyal dog Cuffy, he devised a plan. Quietly, he slid into the sea, holding onto an oar. Unfortunately, Cuffy's yelp alerted the crew. Jarwin dove underwater, carrying Cuffy on his back. He swam tirelessly towards the shore, praying for strength. As he reached land, the Captain's boat approached. Jarwin hid in the woods, escaping the pirates.

John Jarwin and his dog, Cuffy, were fast asleep on the beach when a native chief discovered them. The chief, a large man armed with a club, woke Jarwin with a kick and gestured for them to follow. They were taken to the village, where they were met with curiosity. Jarwin feared being sacrificed by the savages, but he was spared due to previous bad experiences with eating white men. Despite harsh treatment by the chief, Jarwin's singing voice impressed him, leading to long singing sessions. Jarwin hoped to escape with the help of missionaries in the region.

Throughout his adventure, Cuffy, the loyal dog, faced many challenges. Initially captured and nearly cooked, he managed to escape to the mountains, where he lived in sorrow. Missing his master, Cuffy returned to the village but was chased away, leading him back to the hills. After a long separation, Jarwin and Cuffy reunited in the mountains. At first fearful, Cuffy recognized his master's whistle and joyfully bounded towards him. The heartwarming reunion was full of excitement as Cuffy showed his affection in a frenzy of barks and leaps. Eventually, war erupted between the Big Chief's tribe and a rival group. Jarwin, initially hesitant, joined the battle in defense of his tribe. His bravery and skill in combat helped secure victory and peace. Later, Christian missionaries visited, aiming to convert the tribe to Christianity, which intrigued the Big Chief, leading to deep contemplation.|"['1.

Jarwin, a captive who underwent painful tattooing, sailed with Big Chief to Raratonga, inspired by the missionary Williams's success in spreading Christianity. Despite the Raratongans' cruel customs, the Gospel transformed them, leading to the abandonment of idols and the adoption of virtuous lives. The Raratongans had practiced unnatural customs like sons fighting fathers for land and widows being mistreated. The missionaries faced challenges due to the people's fierce contention over land. Despite these obstacles, the Gospel changed the Raratongans within a year. Williams, sacrificing his life for his beliefs, spread Christianity to other islands. Jarwin, disguised as a native warrior, embarked on this voyage. If he betrayed Big Chief by speaking English, he risked severe punishment.|"['1.

Jarwin, a British seaman, assured the Big Chief that he would keep his promise not to reveal that he could speak English. As they voyaged on the Pacific, the day was calm and serene. The canoes glided over the water, reflecting the sky like a mirror. The warriors paddled tirelessly, pausing only for short breaks. Even at night, they continued their journey under the stars, the water shimmering like amber and gold. As they approached Raratonga, the Chief reminded Jarwin of his promise, emphasizing the need for honesty. The sight of the island's hills brought joy to their hearts. Nearing the shore, they encountered a crowd of natives cautiously led by a figure waving a white flag. The Chief signaled for the paddling to stop, wary of the unfolding scene.

They learned that the people of Raratonga had abandoned their idols and embraced Christianity. Big Chief acknowledged that missionaries had previously visited his island and shared the same message. He expressed his intention to observe and understand before making any decisions. Big Chief then met King Makea, a powerful and muscular man, who was also interested in the new religion.

In the South Sea Islands, tabooing is a custom where certain things are considered sacred and cannot be used or touched. This extends to body parts like the hands, where the person tabooed must be fed by others. Jarwin found the idea of his tongue being tabooed amusing and burst into laughter. To avoid giving himself away, he turned his laugh into a yell and ran off. Meanwhile, a missionary on a remote island was planning to build a ship. This was a monumental task due to the lack of resources and the inexperience of the islanders. The missionary faced challenges like not having the tools needed for shipbuilding.

"Mr. Williams, determined to find a way to raise wind, used his creativity. He built a box with a valve at the bottom to let air in and a hole in the front to let it out. A piston helped force the air out. By using a lever to raise the piston and weights to push it down, he created a continuous blast of wind. Natives helped operate the contraption. They worked admirably, but there were some issues like sucking in fire and long intervals between blasts. To fix this, Mr. Williams made another box to work alternately with the first. The natives also helped in making planks, spinning twine from tree bark, and constructing a vessel named _The Messenger of Peace_.

I trust Big Chief, but if others turn against him, he can't help us much."" After inspecting the food, he praised the provisions, including baked pig, roast fish, plantains, yams, and coconut milk. He joked with Cuffy about being fattened up before being killed. Later, he was summoned to the royal hut by Big Chief. Despite his loss of freedom, he acknowledged the Chief's kindness, and they shared a unique nose-rubbing gesture symbolizing their friendship."|"['Question 1:\nWhat did the hero do to pass the time?\nA) Talked to his dog, Cuffy\nB) Slept\nC) Went for a walk\nD) Read a book\nE) Watched TV', 'Question 2:\nHow did the hero feel when dinner arrived?\nA) Anxious\nB) Excited\nC) Relieved\nD) Angry\nE) Sad', ""Question 3:\nWhat did the hero say about sticking together with Cuffy?\nA) He doesn't trust Big Chief\nB) He will abandon Cuffy\nC) They will stick together no matter what\nD) Cuffy is not important to him\nE) He will turn against Big Chief"", 'Question 4:\nWhat did the hero joke about with Cuffy?\nA) Going for a swim\nB) Being chased by a lion\nC) Getting lost in the jungle\nD) Being fattened up before being killed\nE) Flying in the sky', 'Question 5:\nHow did the hero feel towards the Big Chief?\nA) Afraid\nB) Angry\nC) Grateful\nD) Sad\nE) Disrespectful', 'Question 6:\nWhat gesture did the hero and the Big Chief share to symbolize their friendship?\nA) Handshake\nB) High-five\nC) Hug\nD) Nose-rubbing\nE) Fist bump']"|['A) Talked to his dog, Cuffy', 'C) Relieved', 'C) They will stick together no matter what', 'D) Being fattened up before being killed', 'C) Grateful', 'D) Nose-rubbing']
Jarwin, a sailor, had a liking for Big Chief, a native chief, but the chief preferred his own family. Big Chief decided to set Jarwin free, as he admired Jarwin's commitment to his Christian faith.

Jarwin sat down amidst a low sound of approval. Soon, an aged chief stood up to respond. He mentioned that despite not fully grasping the white brother's words due to their difference in knowledge, he agreed that a group should be sent to Raratonga to inform the Cookee missionaries of recent events and seek guidance. Another chief echoed similar sentiments. The Big Chief then ordered the canoes for the delegation to be prepared promptly. As the gathering dispersed with cheerful cries, Jarwin, content with the turn of events, pondered in his hut. Feeling the urge to be outdoors due to the fine weather, he decided to stroll in the nearby woods. Accompanied by his loyal dog Cuffy, they explored the woods, relishing the present and looking forward to the future. However, their peaceful walk took an unexpected turn when they encountered war-canoes on the coast, leading to a perilous confrontation with hostile savages.|"[""1.
