Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Diamond who slept in a small loft above a coach house. His father, a coachman, had named him after a beloved horse. Diamond's bed was surrounded by boards as the space was limited in the loft where hay and straw were stored for the horses below. At night, he could hear the horses munching or moving in their sleep. Sometimes, the wind would shake his bed, making him wonder if the house would collapse. Despite the wind blowing through a hole in the wall, Diamond found a creative way to block it with a makeshift cork.

"The following passage has been rewritten using the provided vocabulary for middle school students:

The next day, little Diamond completely forgot about the hole in his room. However, his mother discovered it while making his bed and covered it with a piece of thick brown paper. That night, as Diamond settled into bed, he didn't think about it at all. But as he was about to fall asleep, he heard a strange noise and lifted his head to listen. Was someone speaking to him? The wind was picking up outside, creating a whistling sound. He explored to find the source of the sound and accidentally touched the paper-covered knot-hole. Placing his ear against it, he heard a voice clearly. ""Well, I can pull the covers over my head,"" said Diamond. He carefully tore off the paper, feeling a rush of cold air against his chest. Startled, he quickly covered himself with the bedclothes. With his head under the covers, he could still hear the voice, which now sounded gentle and somewhat familiar. Diamond realized the voice resembled his mother's. The voice insisted he come out, and as the word was spoken, a strong gust of wind blew in, startling Diamond awake. Looking up, he saw a large, beautiful woman with dark, flashing eyes and streaming black hair."|"[""1.

The small primrose, a perfect baby wonder, caught Diamond's attention. As the wind began to blow, the leaves around the flower swayed, but the primrose remained still, gazing at the sky. It seemed like a golden eye peeking from the dark earth. North Wind, a mystical figure, invited Diamond to join her on an adventure. She playfully urged him to dress quickly so they could journey together. With a laugh, North Wind disappeared, prompting Diamond to rush and follow her. He found her by the primrose, ready to lead him on a magical escapade. Holding her hand, they traversed the garden, scaled a wall, and arrived by the river under a starry sky. As they walked, North Wind transformed into a tall girl, with her hair billowing in the wind.

"The North Wind chuckled happily and sped up. Her grassy dress swirled around her steps, making withered leaves dance and scatter as she walked. ""No, I didn't eat a baby,"" she explained. ""I scared a mean nurse who was being unkind to a child."" As they climbed a grassy hill, North Wind grew larger, her hair extending toward the stars. She crafted a nest in her hair for Diamond, lifting him into the sky. From above, Diamond saw the earth rush by below, with trees, water, and houses passing like a river.

One day, Diamond encountered a little girl struggling against the fierce wind with a troublesome broom. As the wind howled, the girl's rags fluttered, and she seemed terribly lonely. Without a word, North Wind swooped down, nearly getting swept away by the gust. Diamond chased after the girl, trying to help, but her dress tore when he tried to grab her. Eventually, Diamond managed to catch her and saw North Wind disappearing around the corner. The little girl decided it was better to join them than stay in the street. They wandered aimlessly until they reached a desolate area. Exhausted, Diamond feared he had led them astray. However, the girl was glad to have his company. Together, they found themselves on a hill, only to be blown downhill by a gust of wind, crashing into a garden's back door.|['1.

Diamond recognized the familiar garden of Mr. Coleman and felt relieved to be home. He invited a little girl in for breakfast, but she declined, needing to return to her duties. As she hurried off, Diamond tried to call her back, but she disappeared over the hill. He closed the garden gate and headed to the stables, happy to be back in his own bed. Later, while riding with his father to the blacksmith, Diamond saw the same little girl sweeping a crossing for a penny. Moved by her disappointment, Diamond gave her a penny before rushing back to his father.

In the warm summer nearing its arrival, a young boy often played on Mr. Coleman's lawn next door. One evening, as he sat in a small summer-house by a bed of closed tulips, a bumblebee suddenly emerged from one of them. The bee spoke, explaining how it may seem cruel to others but it actually takes them to a mysterious place behind the north wind. The boy was invited to join the bee but was told to go to bed first. Later that night, a magical being named North Wind appeared and whisked the boy away on a thrilling adventure across the river, leaving the boy bewildered yet eager to learn more.

"""Oh, North Wind!"" he whispered. But his words vanished like soap bubbles from his pipe. The wind carried them away. A thunderous boom shook Diamond's heart as he searched for North Wind's face. Her eyes peered through the clouds. ""Dear North Wind!"" cried the boy. ""Why sink the ship? You care for me, yet destroy the ship! I can't believe it! You must love me to show such beauty. Sink ships, but not in front of me!"" North Wind leaped into the clouds, causing thunder and lightning. Diamond felt engulfed in a storm of serpentine winds.

North Wind, with a swift motion of her large white arm, removed the darkness like a curtain, revealing a blue night adorned with stars. Together, they entered a cathedral through an open door in one of its towers. Inside, they walked along a narrow gallery encircling the church's central area, leading to a broad stairway descending further down. North Wind embraced Diamond, planting a kiss on his forehead before vanishing, leaving behind the sound of a storm brewing. In the dimly lit church, with the moon rising, Diamond observed beautiful figures materializing in the stained glass windows above him. Overwhelmed by weariness, he lay down on a carpet and drifted into a peaceful slumber, captivated by the enchanting moonlit figures above.|['1.

When Diamond woke up, he found himself surrounded by dark hay instead of the lovely figures he expected. The small blue panes in the roof of his loft were glowing in the morning light. Old Diamond, his horse, was waking up in the stable below, shaking himself vigorously. Diamond admired how well his horse could shake off. He quickly got ready and went outside to Mr. Coleman's lawn. There, he saw the aftermath of the storm from the night before—a crushed summer-house and a broken elm tree. As he pondered the scene, a guest from the Coleman house appeared. Diamond thought about North Wind's promise to take people to a special land and decided he would ask her to take him there too. Later, Diamond's mother, concerned about his health, sent him to visit an aunt in Sandwich. While resting in a toy-shop, he witnessed a magical event with a whistle and a turning windmill, leading to an adventure that left him feeling unwell but with a mysterious encounter with North Wind.|"['1.

"""Alright,"" Diamond agreed, and he leaped into North Wind's embrace. Instantly, as her arms wrapped around him, he began to feel better. The night was dark, with only occasional glimpses of stars peeking through the clouds. North Wind explained to Diamond the challenge of reaching the far north, her home. She couldn't blow directly north, so she had to weaken and draw into herself to journey that way. To help Diamond, she planned to place him aboard a passing ship headed towards the north pole.

On a grand ship, North Wind offered Diamond a ride towards the north. They sped through strange landscapes of floating ice resembling cathedrals and castles. North Wind led Diamond onto an iceberg, where he witnessed her ethereal form fading away. As they approached a shining peak on the horizon, Diamond disembarked onto a rocky shore. There, he encountered a woman with a glacier-like appearance, whom he recognized as North Wind. Despite her stillness, Diamond reached out but only felt intense cold. As the surroundings turned white, he stumbled and fell, crossing the threshold to the back of the north wind.|"[""1.

In a magical land, Diamond found himself without the North Wind, snow, or ice. The place smelled sweet, the gentle air caressed him, and a crystal-clear river flowed over the grass, murmuring a melodious tune. Under a perpetual cloudless light, the sky resembled a heavenly harp. Everyone seemed content, with the promise of even greater joy ahead. To find out about loved ones, Diamond climbed a special tree. Witnessing his mother's tears, he yearned to return home. Determined, he sought the North Wind, finally spotting her in the distance. Running through thickening whiteness, he reached her, and as he touched her, she awoke. Embracing Diamond, she transformed into a weasel, then a cat, and so on until he chased a Bengal tiger.|"['1.

Diamond was no longer afraid of North Wind, having ridden on her back before. As the tiger disappeared into the distance, Diamond decided to slow down near the icy precipices. He trusted North Wind to return for him, knowing she was just teasing. Suddenly, North Wind swept him up, and they flew southward, the sea and stars passing beneath them. Diamond fell asleep in her arms. Meanwhile, the doctor advised Diamond's mother to keep him quiet. Diamond's father faced trouble as his employer, Mr. Coleman, failed in business due to dishonest dealings with Mr. Evans, Miss Coleman's lover.

Mr. Coleman faced ruin after losing his ship. He had to sell his house and horses, including old Diamond. They moved to a less pleasant place, teaching him the value of honesty and contentment over quick riches. Meanwhile, Miss Coleman believed her lover had perished, adding to the family's woes. When old Diamond was sold, young Diamond's father lost his job, leaving the family in a financial crisis. Despite wishing to help, Diamond had to focus on recovering first. Luckily, Diamond's aunt welcomed them to stay with her in Sandwich. One day, Diamond and his mother went to the sea, enjoying a meal together.

The little white daisies grow, blow, and spread their crowns, praising the sun. When the sun sets, they fold up, only to praise again when he rises. The sheep that graze near them are quiet and merry, and the lambs forget to eat as they frolic. Diamond, falling asleep, hears the river's song telling him to be merry, cheerful, and helpful. Soon after, Diamond and his mother could return home. His father, meeting a cabman friend, learned about an old horse for sale, which turned out to be Diamond. Overjoyed, Diamond's father bought him back along with a cab, setting up as a cabman. When Diamond, his mother, and the baby arrived in London, his father surprised him with the news that the horse was Diamond, leading to a joyful reunion.|"['1.

When Diamond arrived at the stables where they would be staying, he felt a bit disheartened at first. However, he remembered the soothing song of the river at the back of the north wind and decided to focus on the positive things around him. Despite the gloomy rain outside, he found comfort in the fact that their familiar furniture was all there. He also noticed the cozy fire that a neighbor had lit for them, with tea and bread and butter ready. Diamond's parents were feeling down, but he refused to let the darkness take over. Remembering the peacefulness of the north wind, he resolved to make things right.

When Diamond entered his mother's room, he found her tending to the fire while his father was waking up. Taking care of his awake baby sibling, Diamond helped until his mother prepared breakfast. Despite his mother and father appearing somber, Diamond tried to remain cheerful for the baby, which eventually made his mother smile. Impressed by Diamond's care, his mother praised him, comparing his actions to those of a fairy. As they headed out, Diamond recognized the horse in the yard as his beloved old Diamond. Overwhelmed with joy, he hugged and kissed the horse, expressing his gratitude for their luck. Eager to learn, Diamond asked his father to let him drive a bit, and after a successful attempt, he happily returned to his mother. Later, a man who sold old Diamond to Diamond's father saw the boy's excitement about driving and took him for a short ride, where they narrowly avoided a collision with another cab, coincidentally meeting Diamond's father.|"[""1.

Diamond quickly became a favorite among the stable workers due to his cheerful demeanor. Despite the rough environment, he refused to pick up bad language, which led the men to feel embarrassed and censor themselves. One day, Diamond climbed onto an old horse's back and diligently combed and brushed its mane. The men were entertained when the horse flicked the comb away, but Diamond persisted until the task was done, exclaiming how tired he was afterward. His interactions with the men eventually led to them teaching him how to drive various horses through London's busy streets. In a moment of bravery, Diamond intervened to help a girl being harassed by rough individuals, earning the gratitude of the girl and a chance encounter with Mrs. Coleman and Miss Coleman, whom he happily drove home without accepting payment.|"['1.

It had been a while since Diamond had encountered North Wind or even given her much thought. As his father drove, Diamond's mind wandered to the crossing sweeper. He pondered why he felt a sense of familiarity with her despite not recalling anything specific. A vivid image of a little girl racing against the wind with her broom surfaced in his mind, triggering memories of his adventure with North Wind in London. One night, Diamond awoke to what he thought was the thunderous North Wind, only to realize it was the sorrowful South Wind. Distressed by the loud, angry voice of a drunken cabman next door, Diamond decided to intervene. He comforted the crying baby, singing a soothing song that eventually lulled the baby to sleep.

One day, Diamond's cab was waiting for a fare, and he took the chance to stretch his legs. He walked up to Nanny, who was always at the crossing with her broom. A tall gentleman appeared and was pleased to see the crossing clean, so he gave Nanny a penny. Curious, he asked Diamond where he lived and gave him a card with his address. Diamond, kind-hearted, gave the penny to Nanny, mentioning his family and friends. This made him realize he needed to learn to read. His father started teaching him that very night, using a book that North Wind had once shown him. Diamond quickly learned to read most of the verses. Concerned about Nanny's absence, Diamond found her ill in a dark and dreary room. He left her some candy and rushed to seek help from Mr. Raymond.|"['1.

Anxious that his young age might deter customers, Diamond was surprised when a hurried man hailed him for a ride to catch a train. He managed the journey well, impressing the passenger who paid him handsomely. Upon returning, Diamond faced some mistreatment from other cabmen and rough boys until a drunk cabman, whom Diamond had helped before, intervened.

Diamond pondered to himself whether the mysterious visitor he encountered was indeed the North Wind. He wondered if she could unknowingly be the ethereal being.

After the new baby arrived, Diamond sang to her, creating new songs because she was a little sister. He didn't want to sing the little brother songs to her. While he sang, his parents listened, forgetting their troubles. Three months had passed, and Diamond's father wanted Mr. Raymond to take Ruby back. Diamond's father felt Mr. Raymond was lazy and not working enough to cover Ruby's expenses. Diamond was thin while Ruby was lazy and fat. Diamond's father fed Ruby, even if it meant Diamond didn't eat enough. However, Mr. Raymond didn't return, and their situation worsened.

He called his special spot his nest, accessed by a small rope ladder hanging from a big beech tree branch. Climbing higher, he found a cozy seat among the leafy branches, feeling safe and comfortable. From there, he admired the stars appearing in the sky and felt the wind's gentle caresses.

"Once more, she ascended high into the sky. Diamond stayed still in her embrace, waiting for her to speak. He strained to see her face, worried she wouldn't respond because she couldn't reveal she wasn't a dream. But her hair obscured her face, intensifying his fear. As she talked, she descended gently onto a grassy hill in a wild, bushy area, with a rabbit warren below. Some rabbits emerged under the moonlight, appearing wise and serious. Instead of fleeing, they approached North Wind slowly, sniffing her with their long lips in a gesture of affection. Occasionally, she petted their furry backs or played with their ears.

In an instant, she appeared at the window and swiftly carried him away. As they soared, the clouds above and the earth below rushed past. The sky was adorned with beautiful clouds around the moon, casting delicate opal-like colors. The warm night in North Wind's embrace shielded him from the winds below, stirring the fields and waters. They descended by a bubbling spring on a hillside. North Wind glided along the stream's surface, murmuring a tale through its song. They reached a river, floating above water lilies and watching fish slumber. North Wind would pause over tranquil hollows and clover fields, then follow the river past wheat fields, willows dipping into the water, and a peaceful garden.

They abandoned the river and drifted above the houses one by one. These beautiful, grand houses resembled tall trees that had taken centuries to grow. The night was silent, with no lights or signs of movement. Everyone was fast asleep in their dreams. As they floated past a lit window, Diamond heard a soft moan. Looking at North Wind, he saw understanding in her eyes. Inside, a lady in white tried to read, masking her pain with soft moans. North Wind sensed Diamond's concern and silently glided in through the window. Diamond sang a soothing river song, calming the lady. They slipped away, and Diamond recognized his old home.
