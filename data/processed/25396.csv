Living with Dotty Dimple was a unique experience. She could be as fierce as a lion when angered, with blazing eyes that seemed like she belonged in a menagerie. Yet, when calm, she was as gentle as a tender lamb. Her behavior was like a rollercoaster, with wild outbursts followed by moments of sweet innocence. Dotty's sisters, Susy and Prudy, often found her in trouble, tied up on the wood-box in the kitchen, roaring like a young lion. They bore her tantrums with patience, feeling the weight of her conduct as a family disgrace. As Dotty grew older, her temper improved, and she learned to control her outbursts. On one particular morning, she woke up grumpy, wishing the world was a giant peach so she could eat forever. Despite her challenges, her sisters stood by her, showing love and understanding.|"['1.

Norah felt embarrassed as she knew her mistress was very particular and didn't allow name-calling.

Prudy's habit of journaling was beneficial. It helped her express thoughts clearly and improve her handwriting.

The girls tried to help but had to flee. The sight of their burning home was distressing. They left with their grandmother, feeling the loss deeply.

Once upon a time, Dotty and her friends went to the beach. They were searching for seashells but found none. Just as they were feeling disappointed, they noticed a boy rowing a boat towards them. Dotty was tempted to join him, despite knowing it was wrong. Her friend Lina followed, also feeling conflicted about disobeying her mother's orders. Dotty ignored her conscience and got into the boat, even though she knew it was a bad idea. The weather started to change, the sky grew dark, and the waves became rough.

If the sky had stayed clear, Dotty might not have felt so guilty. Disobedience is always wrong, no matter the weather. Johnny looked serious, as if he had sailed across the Atlantic many times, but his arms were small. His paddle was like a spoon, and he knew little about boating. Solly and Freddy were older and wiser, yet not as wise as the three men of Gotham in a bowl joke. Dotty felt the wind blew her hat off, but losing it was a small problem compared to being lost at sea. They struggled to row to shore, with the wind pushing them away. The boys' efforts with the paddle were useless. Dotty scolded Solly for lying about being able to row. The sky darkened, and the wind grew stronger, making it harder to reach land.|"[""1.

The boat spun around like a fragile eggshell, tossed by the waves. If her parents had witnessed it, they might have thought it was the end of Dotty Dimple. But in reality, it wasn't her final chapter. The children were spared from a close call, but such mercies are common in life. The man on board, instead of scolding them, decided to take them back safely. It was a narrow escape, and the children knew it. They made silent promises to never wander off alone again. Dotty, feeling embarrassed, sneaked back home, leaving wet marks on the carpet. She avoided her father, while Johnny sought refuge with the chambermaid.

Dotty had almost forgotten that her troubles were her fault. She blamed her innocent sister, Prudy, for not knowing she needed help. Shivering, Dotty refused supper and wondered how many meals it would take to starve. Downstairs, three seats were empty at dinner. Mr. Parlin, unaware of Dotty's situation, chatted with Mr. Eastman.

Dotty's anger was a mask for her discomfort. Despite her unreasonableness, Prudy knew Dotty would calm down once comfortable. Dotty shared her adventure of being in a sailboat with Solly and Johnny, where they almost tipped over. She ended with a headache from the wild ride.|"['1.

Dinah was passed around the room for sympathy. She had a mustard plaster on her chest to help with lung fever, and her broken ankle was set with a splinter. Susy wasn't bothered by the teasing because it was Katie showing off Dinah. The real concern was Flyaway's unpredictable behavior. Dotty Dimple, not Flyaway, caused the chaos. Dotty wasn't feeling well after a boat ride and felt ignored by the older guests. Johnny Eastman, her age, avoided her due to a past incident. Percy and Johnny plotted a prank on Dotty for fun.

Dotty's unpleasant outburst completed her bad mood. She forgot her promise to control her anger and became self-willed. Her cousin suggested leaving Dotty alone and turned to Flyaway, offering to pin her up in a shawl for a cent. The children laughed as a baby in the scene unexpectedly spoke.

Her fears disappeared. She debated returning to the parlor with forgiveness or staying away, causing unhappiness, when she saw a strange, horrifying sight - not white, but yellow. Could it be a ghost? A ghost on fire, without a sheet, only a terrifying head peering through the window. It had a mouth as deep as a cave, all ablaze. These thoughts raced through Dotty's mind like lightning. Suddenly, she let out a loud, terrified scream and collapsed on the floor, barely breathing. Percy, realizing the danger of the shock, tried to comfort her. He explained that Johnny was trying to tease her and that he brought the pumpkin. As Percy tried to soothe her, Johnny, in a panic, splashed water on Dotty's face. Just then, Mr. and Mrs. Parlin entered the room.|['1.
