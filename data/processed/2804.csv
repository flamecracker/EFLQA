For a while, Rose enjoyed spending time with her cousin Charlie. However, she soon wished he would find something productive to do instead of constantly following her around. The family had always indulged Charlie, considering him the favorite and believing he would bring honor to their name. Despite his talent, Charlie lacked direction, causing concern among the elders. Rose wanted to inspire him to pursue a purpose that would earn respect and admiration. However, Charlie's carefree attitude and excuses made it challenging for Rose to get through to him. Lately, Rose noticed that Charlie expected her undivided attention and seemed to misinterpret her efforts. This led her to feel trapped, especially when Aunt Clara pressured her to influence Charlie. Despite Charlie's charming nature, Rose was wary of his possessiveness and preferred more humble suitors.|"[""1.

Rose defended her charitable activities, explaining that she had seen much suffering during her travels with her uncle, who was involved in charitable work. She expressed her determination to continue helping those in need, even if it meant sacrificing some comforts.

It was really tough to resist the pleading voice and eyes, for this humility was risky; and, except for Uncle Alec, Rose would have said “yes.” The blue forget-me-nots reminded her of her own promise, and she kept it with difficulty now, to be glad always afterward. Putting back the offered trinket with a gentle touch, she said firmly, though she dared not look up into the anxious face bending toward her: “No, Charlie I can't wear it. My hands must be free if I'm to help you as I ought. I will be kind, I will trust you, but don't swear anything, only try to resist temptation, and we'll all stand by you.”Charlie did not like that and lost the ground he had gained by saying impetuously: “I don't want anyone but you to stand by me, and I must be sure you won't desert me, else, while I'm mortifying soul and body to please you, some stranger will come and steal your heart away from me. I couldn't bear that, so I give you fair warning, in such a case I'll break the bargain, and go straight to the devil.”The last sentence spoiled it all, for it was both masterful and defiant.

A sudden change in Charlie's voice made Rose realize it was time to leave. With a silent goodbye, Charlie departed, leaving Rose to care for the neglected flowers and put away the bracelet with a sense of regret. She decided not to wear it until her feelings returned to how they were before. Meanwhile, Kitty had exciting news to share - she was engaged! Despite Rose's teasing about Kitty's previous short-lived engagements, Kitty was convinced this one was different. She believed that being engaged was the only way to truly know a man. Kitty described her ideal man, Steve, who she had known for a long time and was confident she could manage him. She found his attention to detail endearing, even falling in love with his pocket handkerchiefs. Rose was pleased to see Kitty show a hint of sentimentality, and encouraged her to bring out the warmth and seriousness in Steve. As they arrived at a store to browse silks, Kitty and Rose discussed their preferences, with Kitty advising Rose to get an opal that she thought would suit her well.
