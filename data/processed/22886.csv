I discussed the new Government Curator appointment at Mabgwe Ruins. I supported it, the bar-tender did not. The Curator faced challenges exploring the ruins, writing to the press. I left, crossed the river, and headed to the Ruins. A car passed, carrying a Jo'burg magnate and unknown passengers. I reached the Ruins first. I drank from a temple's water, sat smoking under a tree. The tower loomed. I admired the temple's grandeur, the blue roof, and broken columns. Lunchers arrived, rushed by time. A Church dignitary and an engineer were among them. The dignitary, a Rhodesian patriot, disagreed with McIver's native origin theory for the Ruins.|"[""1.

"""I have seen buildings in North Africa,"" he told me. ""They weren't much like those at Mabgwe. In the north, if they built with stones they built with great slabs. But those granite flakes at Mabgwe were easy for a primitive people to manage - a very primitive people. Very primitive, or why did they build on sand when, six inches deeper, they might have founded on bed-rock? They didn't understand arches, seemingly. They weren't very careful about bond in building, were they? Nor were they very careful to break joint outside, much less inside, so far as I can judge. And the script; where is it? And the graves; where are they? If they were Semites, why didn't they write? If they were Semites, why didn't they bury? . . . But it isn't as easy as it looks, the riddle. There are one or two jagged ends that conical tower, for instance.""

""I'm sorry,"" he said, ""not to take more interest in this sort of thing. Only, after all, it's African-built, and Europeans could do the thing a bit better, couldn't they? This sort of thing seems rather a wrong line of advance. If I hadn't seen Mabgwe so lately I mightn't mind so much."" They showed us to a hut, a very clean one.

The next day, I made three mistakes. I skipped a meeting; I missed the True Romance Pageant performance; and I overlooked the St. Uriel's Native Church bazaar at the Pageant grounds. St. Uriel's church was constructed by European builders, described as a very educational building by the Pageant-Master. As we journeyed towards the hills, we finally reached a massive circular stone structure with a dome. Spenser noted that it resembled a stone cattle shed and a Kaffir hut, not built in the traditional Mabgwe style. Despite some European involvement, the construction was primarily done by Africans. The work had faced setbacks due to rains and the departure of the European overseer. However, a skilled African craftsman had taken charge, rebuilding the damaged parts slowly but steadily. The ongoing construction was seen as both an artistic and religious endeavor, symbolizing the growing Christian faith in the region.|"['1.

The speaker expressed sympathy for the natives, emphasizing the importance of portraying them accurately rather than romantically. He suggested replacing 'Iberians' with 'Zambesians' in a literary piece to highlight the historical significance of the Tyrian traders. Despite differing views on defining romance, they acknowledged the value of individuals like the Mashona building-boy. The conversation touched on the concept of justice and accountability, referencing the granite kopje church and Magbwe Ruins. The group prepared for an expedition on an armed steamer, with additional personnel and weaponry. A cheerful padre aboard provided guidance and support, helping the narrator recognize their shortcomings. The padre's enthusiasm for new experiences added a positive energy to the journey.|"['1.

We lay on camp beds high on the bridge-deck, not falling asleep when the electric light dimmed. Chatting about England, we planned to rise early for our dark raid. Coffee ordered at 5:30, action expected by 6 a.m. Speculating on facing an old field gun and a Maxim, we pondered the role of saints in war. Discussing prayers, I questioned if German and English gods clashed. My friend, a C.M.S. man, not into medieval tales, bid me good night. I slept restlessly, waking before the ship's departure. Peering over the bulwark at the shore Maxim, I prayed for Saint Michael's protection. A figure in khaki overheard, noting the importance of biblical prayers.|"[""1.

I don't believe that Saint Michael is fervently focused on eliminating English, askaris, or Germans. It's probably more effective to pray to him as you did. Negative actions may appeal to him more than positive ones, salvaging rather than erasing. The conversation was interrupted when the officer in pajamas approached me. By the time I got ready, the man from the sandbags had left. As we entered the bay, the morning's beauty surrounded us in shades of amber, rose, and feathery grey. The gun crew was ready, and I tried to read the Prayer before Action. My enthusiastic colleague spoke to me, and I realized it was the officer from the sandbags. He was slim and elegant in khaki, lacking any insignia. He moved towards the guns without hesitation. Our gun shook the ship as we targeted a trench on the hillside. It was a one-sided battle, with no response from the enemy. My colleague remarked on the gun's power, while I prayed for those facing it on the hill. Moments passed slowly as the ship maneuvered. The gun fired again, targeting a crowd of askaris on the hill. I observed the gun-layer as he adjusted the weapon, while my sandbag friend moved among the crew, taking charge after the official gun-layer. After shelling multiple positions, we took a break for breakfast.|['1.

There was a lot of talk about the potential impact of our recent actions on the shore. The store ship that had followed us had been a great asset. People on land were likely hesitant to make a move, thinking the ship carried troops. Now, as the ship sailed away slowly, we pondered the outcome of our efforts. The Intelligence Officer and my colleague were optimistic, but the gunnery officer felt otherwise. After a meal of porridge, bacon, and eggs, we resumed our duties. The guns fired once more, with no response. A motorboat adventure followed, with a mix of crew members ready for action. As the boat departed, our ship continued to fire rounds. While some sought war trophies, the potential consequences of our actions weighed heavily on my mind.|"['1.

He suggested taking the shell-cases as trophies under Saint Michael's feet instead of using them as altar-vases. The idea was to create a gleaming serpent of slaughter for the saint to tread on. The mysterious man disappeared among the sailors, leaving a sense of intrigue. The narrator never saw him again, and inquiries about him were met with confusion. The scene then shifts to a peaceful countryside where the narrator felt grateful for the tranquility amidst wartime. The group shared a Christian memorial, had breakfast, and enjoyed the serene surroundings. They encountered a Dutch-looking host with British sympathies who engaged in a thoughtful discussion about the ongoing war. The encounter ended with a shy girl and her father sharing their plans for her boarding with a kind lady in town.|"[""1.

"""Yes, very kind,"" I whispered, considering that the lady's kindness might be well repaid. The child could be helpful and not costly. She might offer valuable assistance that is usually expensive in our country. ""Yes,"" the father smiled, ""and she might be able to attend the day school that way, as the lady mentioned. We wouldn't have been able to afford sending her to town otherwise. But now she has the opportunity to go to a regular school."" ""Oh, really,"" my friend exclaimed. His kind but unattractive face didn't look too pleased as he spoke. Then he went to tend to his mules, muttering under his breath. It was unusual for him to curse straps or mules, I thought. We bid a warm farewell and drove towards the main road. As we neared the big water-course with thirsty sand banks, he revealed what he was cursing. He repeated his words intentionally: ""Damn it, damn it to hell,"" he said. I hesitated until he clarified what he was cursing, then I boldly agreed with his frustration. He wasn't cursing Heaven or humanity; he was cursing the divisive racial policies in South Africa.

After all, can any reasonable and lively Christian Faith lead South African Racialists to any destination apart from hell for their Racialism, unless a place of purgation is found as suggested by my friend? Yes, indeed, God's mercy in Jesus is boundless, but are these Racialists as merciful to little colored children to deserve mercy without facing judgment from Jesus? Despite the Love of Jesus, the ultimate motive for Christian Reform, the reality remains that Racialism may lead individuals into fiery consequences. I am pleased that our lay reader delivered a sermon on this topic, causing a stir among the congregation. The preacher seemed resolute in his beliefs, emphasizing the importance of addressing the consequences of racial prejudice. As we sat in a lush valley enjoying roast monkey-nuts, my friend shared his conviction that his words were guided by a higher power, highlighting the need to consider the impact of one's actions on children. The preacher's fiery sermon was a wake-up call, urging us to reflect on our traditions and their consequences.|"['1.

I was requested to meet and stay with some acquaintances by a local leader from Rosebery. It was a Saturday night, and after a quiet dinner, we all praised Africa enthusiastically. One of the guests, Drayton, a cheerful young man, listened attentively. The next day, Drayton mentioned Mr. Browne's potential move to a simpler life in Africa. I changed the subject, unaware of the significance. The following day, I organized a horseback trip for them, but only Mrs. Browne and Drayton returned by sunset. Mrs. Browne mentioned that Mr. Browne had ventured further with Johannes, my trusted helper. As the night fell, there was no sign of them. Mrs. Browne remained composed, assuring us of his return. Drayton later shared a cryptic quote with me on the stoep after dinner.|"['1.

Jerry Browne, a man captivated by Africa's allure, embarked on an unexpected journey that left his wife puzzled. Drayton, a friend, shared Browne's fascination with the continent. Browne's sudden departure without provisions or blankets surprised those close to him. Drayton quickly organized a young boy to follow Browne and ensure his safe return. Browne's wife, tearful and worried, recounted his unusual farewell. Drayton, aware of Browne's adventurous spirit, expressed doubt about his prompt return.

As the evening approached, I felt worn out. What should I do next? However, as the sun began to set, news arrived. A local person who had traveled from the northern town brought me a handwritten message from Johannes: 'Dear father, please come to us. Hurry with your horse. The white man is not turning back. He has finished his food and is heading to the hills, claiming he is mad. Please pray for us! Johannes.' I immediately went to see Mrs. Browne. I found her sitting under a vibrant hibiscus bush, looking pale against its bright colors. I informed her that her husband wanted to extend his journey. She burst into tears, unable to comprehend it. I then mentioned my plan to go after him the next morning to expedite his return. This lifted her spirits, and she began preparing what I should bring. Drayton, whom I showed Johannes' note to after dinner, reacted seriously. 'Don't worry,' I reassured him. 'It just means he's run out of our supplies. He can buy local food like monkey-nuts, sweet potatoes, or rice in the villages. He might have developed a taste for native cuisine and snuff. He will manage.' The next morning, we set off early, even though Drayton was still in bed when I returned from church. We departed at eight, relieved to find that we had good horses. We took comfort in the memory of Browne's|"['1. What did the local person bring to the speaker from Johannes?\nA. A book\nB. A handwritten message\nC. A map\nD. A painting\nE. A gift', '2.

As we journeyed, we inquired at local homes and eventually picked up a fresh trail in the afternoon. A white traveler on a speckled mule had passed by in the morning, accompanied by a boy carrying blankets. We then took a break to rest our ponies. As darkness approached, we sought refuge in a nearby village. Unfortunately, there was no talk of the white traveler's passing that day. The villagers kindly offered us beans, monkey-nuts for dinner, and mealies for our ponies. After our meal, we relaxed on a rush mat and contemplated the mysterious traveler. The villagers provided us with an old hut, which we later exchanged for a spot under a rocky hill where we spent the night peacefully. The next day, we continued our search for clues, riding through the challenging hill terrain. Despite our efforts, we found no leads and settled for the night in a desolate garden, building a fire and sharing a quiet meal before retiring under the starlit sky.|['1.

Mrs. Browne was thrilled to have Gerald back home, but it took her some time to trust in his well-being again. She had been through a lot of worry. Drayton and I were careful not to reveal too much about what had really happened. Unfortunately, I forgot to warn Johannes, and Mrs. Browne got a strange version of events from him while we were at church. Despite her usual thriftiness, she generously gave Johannes a whole gold coin. The three travelers departed on the slow morning train the next day.

More than two years ago, I had to leave my country parish due to illness and embark on a journey to the south. After spending time in the Mediterranean, I traveled to the eastern coast of Africa. Reluctantly leaving Zanzibar behind, I ventured into the rugged terrain of the central tableland, planning to eventually head to Cape Town by rail. During Easter week, I found myself lost while camping overnight. Waking up disoriented, I realized I had missed my intended destination, a mission station, the previous night. With no nearby village or passers-by, I decided to rest until dawn. As the sun rose in the heavy April dew, baboons barked from a nearby hill. Observing a mist rising from a stream and native trees, I spotted a figure approaching down a path—it was Leonard Reeve, the man I had been seeking. He greeted me warmly, and even though we had run out of food, he assured me that we could manage. I instructed my carrier to gather provisions while we were away.|['1.

I walked alongside my small, damp friend through the dew-covered grass on a chilly day. We attended a lovely service in a unique church made of wattle, earth, and grass on a hilltop. The church overlooked village gardens and wooded uplands. Although I couldn't understand all the words, the service was beautiful. Afterward, we visited the home of a native teacher, where we were warmly welcomed. We shared tea and conversation, reminiscing about past times. The teacher's enthusiasm for his homeland was evident, and we enjoyed discussing the differences between his previous life in a busy city and his current peaceful surroundings in the African moorland. Later, he showed me his church, which, though well-kept, lacked the charm of the simpler decorations I had admired at his teacher's altar.|"['1.

Leonard Reeve was known for his methodical approach to organizing classes at the Mission. Students were categorized as 'Inquirer,' 'Hearer,' 'Catechumen,' or 'Under a cloud,' and taught accordingly. While his work was meticulous and thoughtful, he appeared somewhat unhappy and unwell. As I prepared to leave for home, we enjoyed a delightful evening discussing letters and papers. Reeve's interaction with a native boy delivering mail revealed a tender side to him, contrasting his usual courteous but distant demeanor.

Leonard expressed his fondness for town life, contrasting it with the countryside. Although Leonard's village was unique, he preferred the hustle and bustle of the town.

Why did he fall ill with a fever? Not a physical fever, but an Imperialism-induced fever, drawing him far away. Despite the challenging conditions of the veld, camping, and interacting with primitive people, he remained noble. A Londoner, sharing his sentiments, she would likely find the environment unimpressive. Reflecting on her letter, mentioning her dissatisfaction with life in the Berkshire moors, he pondered her potential reaction to their current location. He showed me a book titled 'The Cheerful City,' extolling urban life. While it might comfort Londoners, for a delirious city dweller, it only evoked longing. Contemplating Leonard's situation, I resolved to offer help by taking on his responsibilities, allowing him to return to his urban life with Cecilia. Leonard's romantic nature seemed unsuited for their current setting, and I feared he wouldn't endure the challenges.|"['1.

I sailed home without replying, freeing the locum tenens in the east village. The blossoming red-thorn tree and roses greeted me, just in time for the annual May games. The next day, I visited my cousin in the Midland town and observed his work. Reflecting on Leonard Reeve's perspective, the town seemed dull in June. I met with a bishop who was keen on hearing about African missions and Leonard Reeve. The bishop found Leonard's character convincing and shared his views on my cousin's parish.

Africa is often likened to Cinderella among the continents, a hard worker with a promising destiny.

During Edgar's school days, a new opportunity arose that sparked hope in his heart. The idea of studying at Oxford, once just a dream, now seemed achievable.

He didn't write much and was absent for five years. When he returned, he seemed reserved at first. However, his interest in the Mission had grown. Despite his silence, he maintained his ability to connect with the Mashona boys. I was relieved to see he hadn't lost his talent for making friends with them.

In the quiet of the drowsy noon, as the Jo'burgers departed, a conversation unfolded about the importance of keeping the road to the north open. Edgar expressed his desire to educate the Mashonas, offering to pay for their schooling in the south. Reflecting on the impact of education from the north, he pondered the balance between Arcadian traditions and the influences of Athens.

In a small South African capital, a new Cathedral was finally taking shape after years of making do with a temporary iron structure. The Bishop overseeing the project, a dark-haired man from Oxford, was pleased with the progress. The initial phase of the Cathedral, built from ruddy sandstone, was nearing completion with a Chancel and Lady-chapel in place. The Bishop, though reserved, spoke highly of the design and construction to the Cathedral Building Committee. He also addressed the issue of fundraising, mentioning the successful events that had contributed to their wealth. However, he expressed concern about the lack of inclusivity towards colored persons and natives within the church. He proposed adding windows to allow them to participate freely in the church services. This proposal stirred controversy among the community, including Mr. Conyers Smythe, a prominent figure who took issue with the Bishop's remarks and sought to confront him about it.|"['1.

The Bishop and his guest met on the porch one evening during Christmas week. The Bishop shared a new book with his guest, and they discussed the cults of the Greek States under the dim light of a new moon. The guest, fair-haired and well-built, seemed troubled, his eyes reflecting a mix of emotions. The Bishop, not believing in tribal gods, sought to bridge the gap between the cults of Xanthos and Melanthos in the city. Despite disagreements, they parted ways amicably, but with differing views on the matter. The guest, Mr. Smythe, declared his refusal to support the Church if the Bishop's plans were carried out. The conversation shifted from the cults to more personal matters, ending with a sense of tension between the two men.|"['1.

During Christmas week, events unfolded predictably after a concession was granted by the Committee. The concessionaire, feeling grateful, prepared for the hallowing day. A procession and anthems were planned, with the Bishop returning from his travels to preach. Villagers and devotees crowded the nave, with only a few catching glimpses from the leper windows. The Bishop's coachman, a Bechuana boy, missed the spectacle. Later, as the Bishop was driven back, his driver, curious about Mr. Smythe's payment, shared a sighting from the previous night. The Bishop, intrigued, sent for the stable-boy and planned to meet Smythe after dinner. This encounter hinted at a looming confrontation over unpaid dues.|"[""1.

Conyers Smythe arrived about an hour later. He and the Bishop had only spent two evenings discussing books since the peculiar one during Christmas. They greeted each other warmly on this April night. Smythe, looking unwell, was concerned about his wife's health while she was in England. The latest news was troubling. Seeking sympathy, he was not confrontational. The conversation started with Greek pagan cults and moved to Christian hagiology. They chatted about the legend of St. Mark, finding common ground. After coffee, they became comfortable friends. The Bishop shared the boys' story with Smythe. Jack and Jim were summoned, appearing well-groomed and confident. They recounted their tale, with Jack speaking slowly and Jim swiftly. Smythe claimed to have been with a sick horse in his stable all evening. Jack mentioned that the stableboy confirmed this. The Bishop concluded that while the boys were truthful, they were mistaken. Smythe, skeptical, likened the story to medieval legends, hinting at ominous outcomes.|"['1.

A year, a month, a week, a natural day for Faustus to repent and save his soul! Time ticks, the devil lurks, and Faustus faces damnation. The Bishop, amused by the quote, eyed his guest, pondering the significance of the chosen date. Skeptical of superstitions like the power of thirteen, salt, and broken mirrors, the Bishop shared his disbelief. However, Smythe, though jovial, seemed contemplative. As the evening waned, Smythe spoke of his wife back in their village near Oxford. The Bishop, gazing into the fire, contemplated the uncertainties of the future. Sadly, Smythe passed away suddenly, leaving behind a letter hinting at forewarnings and a desire to dedicate Transepts to God.

The Bishop expressed relief that the churches would not be funded by commercial activities like bazaars or cafes. He feared they might turn into temples for tribal gods. The Transepts were considered more noble than other parts of the church. The Leper Windows were also esteemed. The Bishop aimed to elevate the standards of worship and charity. He reflected on his travels and experiences in England, where he learned new perspectives. The Bishop was inspired by the harmonious coexistence of different beliefs in Africa. He pondered ways to promote tolerance and generosity among his followers. The Bishop's interactions with Reverend Topready and observations during the harvest season led him to contemplate the importance of tradition and gratitude in religious practices.|"[""1.

On a misty morning in Sussex, the blessing of the boats marked the start of the herring season. The boats bore names like 'Diana Elizabeth,' reminiscent of tales from 'Faerie Queene.' November, a month of decay and punishment, also showcased bravery with bursts of sunlight and vibrant colors. In Africa, November is a spring month, celebrating the release from curses. All Saints' Day is akin to May Day, a time for converts to honor African Saints with spring flowers and palms. At a church service during lambing-time among the South Downs, prayers were lifted for blessings on the flocks. Stonehenge was visited on the longest day, reflecting on the Flame-Stone and comparing observations with Zimbabwe. Let's light bonfires with joy this Christmastide, following in the footsteps of Saint Patrick and celebrating the Light of the World.|"['1.

The Bishop returned from England, filled with knowledge about early missions. He was determined to expand the people's worship and shed light on things that were unclear. After receiving letters from Topready, the Bishop agreed to consecrate the church by Christmas. As he rode to the mission on Saint Stephen's Day, he envisioned a bonfire on the hill above. To his joy, the new church was situated exactly where he had imagined. That evening, under the brilliant starlight, they discussed how the church was built through contributions from the community, without any payment. Topready explained the social pressure that often led to the construction of mission churches, shedding light on the realities behind the seemingly generous donations.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat was the Bishop's main goal after returning from England?\nA) Expand people's worship\nB) Build a new house\nC) Start a school\nD) Open a restaurant\nE) Become a farmer"", 'Question 2:\nWhat did the Bishop agree to do after receiving letters from Topready?\nA) Start a business\nB) Go on a vacation\nC) Consecrate the church by Christmas\nD) Ignore the letters\nE) Write a book', ""Question 3:\nWhat did the Bishop envision on Saint Stephen's Day as he rode to the mission?\nA) A snowstorm\nB) A thunderstorm\nC) A bonfire on the hill above\nD) A flood\nE) A rainbow"", ""Question 4:\nWhere was the new church situated according to the Bishop's vision?\nA) In the ocean\nB) On a mountain\nC) In the forest\nD) Exactly where he had imagined\nE) In a cave"", 'Question 5:\nHow was the new church built according to the passage?\nA) By robots\nB) Through government funding\nC) By contributions from the community\nD) By aliens\nE) By magic', 'Question 6:\nWhat did Topready explain to the Bishop about the construction of mission churches?\nA) The churches were built by professionals\nB) The churches were built by robots\nC) The churches were built by aliens\nD) The churches were built through generous donations\nE) The churches were built without any effort']"|"[""A) Expand people's worship"", 'C) Consecrate the church by Christmas', 'C) A bonfire on the hill above', 'D) Exactly where he had imagined', 'C) By contributions from the community', 'D) The churches were built through generous donations']"
Topready expressed his discontent with the traditional way churches were built, opposing Archdeacon Maynard's approach. He believed that churches should be constructed based on individual contributions of time and money, rather than following a set pattern. Despite facing resistance from the community, Topready insisted on this inclusive approach, advocating for Christians and non-Christians to work together in building a new church. At the consecration of the church, the Bishop emphasized the importance of prayer and thanksgiving, highlighting the symbolism of the sun in various cultures. He encouraged the congregation to celebrate the blessings of the sun during Christmas, urging them to light bonfires as a gesture of gratitude. Topready sought support in his endeavor to challenge the existing system, aligning his actions with the Bishop's teachings.|"[""1.

As the sun set, a large crowd gathered among the rocks. Families, dressed in a mix of traditional and modern attire, carried dead wood for a fire. The Bishop felt uneasy. He worried that these peaceful people could be easily influenced to revive dark practices from the past. Standing on a rock with his companions, he expressed his disapproval of building a grand church. Instead, he suggested they worship in humble spaces according to their means. The Bishop offered to buy the new church from them to correct their misguided efforts. Azariah, feeling remorseful, agreed to give away the thatched structure they had built. The Bishop led the crowd to consecrate the church with a solemn ceremony. As the wood was stacked for the sacrifice, the Bishop lit the thatch, and the church burned brightly under the night sky.|"[""1.

Despite glimpses of natural wonders like the Victoria Falls, Vine yearned for a more rugged and spontaneous experience. Tempted to abandon the journey, he was convinced to continue by the organizer, who promised a more authentic leg of the trip to Great Zimbabwe.

Vine and his group explored the ruins, but they were unrecognizable to him due to recent grooming. Some ruins were even numbered and fenced off. A guide and a local celebrity joined the group, sharing contrasting views on the site's origin. Vine later met a friend at Umvuma, considering where to visit next.

That evening we arrived at the farm where the Kents lived and worked as missionaries. I thought Vine would like them, but I didn't expect him to be so fascinated. The Kents dressed in a style that was popular in England twenty-five years earlier. Mrs. Kent wore a brown Liberty dress, while Miss Kent, who was only twenty-two, wore a pink dress designed by her mother. Mr. Kent had a peculiar taste in fashion that I didn't appreciate. Vine was captivated by their presence and asked about their plans to return home, to which Mr. Kent explained they were heading to Zanzibar or Inhambane for a change. After dinner, we enjoyed music, with Mr. Kent singing songs that reminded Vine of past memories.

"""How long will this continue?"" I asked, trying to understand the situation. I started to find it amusing as I observed our carriers. They were staring as if at a new kind of show. Eventually, Mrs. Kent stopped, though not immediately; it seemed like she really enjoyed the melody. ""Isn't there a reason?"" Vine asked when he finally got off his horse, facing my complaints about his unnecessary delay. He mentioned something about a carnival ride. Later, as we rushed along the vast open plain to catch up on lost time, he recounted a memory from our past.

I have a friend who lives a few miles away, surrounded by amazing rocks and crimson-flowered Kaffir trees. One day last Christmas week, when I visited his homestead, he was not there. The boys informed me that he was sleeping at a trading station to the east and wouldn't return for a day or two. However, he had left instructions for them to offer me dinner if I showed up. During my visit, I noticed a change in his home. Three or four beautiful watercolor paintings decorated his walls, each with an old English title.

Julian worked on revising a farm prospectus at his iron shanty farmhouse. Tired, he spoke briefly with the bearded bailiff about the Mission Church, now empty.

Julian's career in South Africa came to an abrupt end due to fate's cruel stroke. The impact of this sudden change remains uncertain, and we await clarity. Despite being close to the front lines, our exposure to combat was minimal. Engaged in patrols near the border, sporadic skirmishes occurred. The relentless equatorial climate took its toll, with Julian repeatedly falling ill with malaria. During a visit to his outpost, I witnessed his struggle with the disease.

The days were filled with excitement - meeting people at headquarters, sending business messages, writing letters in a hurry, and guiding a small native and his dog to the coast. Finally, I arrived and eagerly discussed shipping updates. Initially, my chances of leaving quickly seemed dim, but then a new idea struck me. Since there were no ships to my intended African destination, why not book a passage to an unknown port? I heard there were transports going beyond.

The following night, I traveled in third class from Johannesburg without missing my train connection. I had the carriage to myself, though a native was cleared out by the guard. As the train neared Mafeking, I woke to find a presence on the other side of the carriage, though only my bag was visible. The next night, nearing Bulawayo, I had a Jewish traveling companion who left at Francistown. Excited to be nearing my country, I struggled to sleep. An old acquaintance, a detective, joined me, unaware of the presence in the seat beside me. After explaining, he looked suspicious. I chuckled at the thought of his notes, but he bid me goodbye, leaving me under his watchful eye.|"['1.

The house I arrived at had a worn-out appearance with peeling white palings. I rushed through breakfast at the station, then navigated my way to the house. Knocking on the door, a woman I had never met before answered. She appeared in mourning attire, with a weary face and trembling lips. I explained that I had come from her husband, whom I had been told about but never met. She tearfully shared that he had visited her that very morning at sunrise, after his passing. It was a touching moment, realizing the depth of their love that transcended even death. As I sat alone on the train afterward, I felt a sense of emptiness but also gratitude that his journey's vigil had come to a peaceful close.|['Question 1: What was the appearance of the house the narrator arrived at?\nA) Bright and colorful\nB) Modern and sleek\nC) Worn-out with peeling white palings\nD) Spacious and luxurious\nE) Rustic and charming', 'Question 2: How did the woman who answered the door appear?\nA) Joyful and cheerful\nB) Angry and frustrated\nC) Confused and disoriented\nD) In mourning attire with a weary face and trembling lips\nE) Energetic and lively', 'Question 3: What did the woman reveal about her husband?\nA) He had left her for another woman\nB) He had passed away\nC) He had lost his job\nD) He had won a lottery\nE) He had gone on a long trip', 'Question 4: How did the narrator feel after the encounter with the woman?\nA) Angry and resentful\nB) Indifferent and apathetic\nC) Sad and empty\nD) Relieved and content\nE) Excited and thrilled', 'Question 5: What did the narrator realize about the love between the woman and her husband?\nA) It was shallow and superficial\nB) It was non-existent\nC) It transcended even death\nD) It was based on lies and deceit\nE) It was recent and fleeting', 'Question 6: What did the narrator feel as they sat alone on the train afterward?\nA) Regret and sorrow\nB) Happiness and joy\nC) A sense of emptiness but also gratitude\nD) Anxiety and fear\nE) Anger and frustration']|['C) Worn-out with peeling white palings', 'D) In mourning attire with a weary face and trembling lips', 'B) He had passed away', 'C) Sad and empty', 'C) It transcended even death', 'C) A sense of emptiness but also gratitude']
I stayed on an island with an Intelligence Officer recently. The island was lush and green, but it had some flaws. Most of the Germans who lived there were now prisoners or had escaped. The sergeant of the askaris had ordered 'no surrender,' but not many native soldiers were hiding in the bush. It seemed like most had given up or become civilians. On a Saturday evening, just before sunset, I arrived at my host's place. We had a simple dinner but had a great conversation. There were three of us at the table - my host, Hunter, and myself. Hunter, a naval officer, accompanied me and stayed the night. He appeared mature for his age, had various interests, and expressed himself well. He seemed a bit cynical about certain things, but my host, the Intelligence Officer, disagreed. He was a patriot and a fighter, with remarkable courage and resourcefulness. His face had a perpetual feverish look, and he had a unique goatee. I couldn't help but notice a resemblance to a medieval character in a print.|"['1.

We talked about Intelligence Work, a part of War Service that I might be biased about. To my shameless joy, Hunter excelled in echoing my own thoughts. He criticized the invasion of people's privacy by reading their letters and the manipulation of distressed locals. He vaguely mentioned questionable methods of persuasion. He strongly condemned the degrading uselessness of the spy system on both sides. He concluded with immature comments about individuals he had encountered, some of whom were the host's agents. His remarks about them did not match the eloquence of his earlier speech. The host took it all in good spirits, being a man of action rather than words. He confessed to feeling regret for his actions that day, particularly when he admitted to resorting to torture. He justified it as a means to prevent an innocent person's execution. The conversation then shifted to the treatment of natives, with Hunter showing a cynical attitude, claiming to have abandoned any previous notions of kindness towards them. He believed in using force instead of compassion to avoid any issues. Despite my objections, Hunter remained firm in his beliefs.|"[""1.

Our host returned and chuckled a bit until he noticed my lack of enjoyment. He then criticized the speaker for overlooking a crucial fact. Wasn't there a limit to his knowledge of Africa? Despite his professed sympathy for Africans, he seemed fixated on them as a hobby, aiming to earn their trust for various reasons. As the conversation shifted, it became more empathetic from my perspective for the rest of the evening until bedtime. We all slept in a spacious room. I had minimal belongings and felt inadequate compared to my naval companion's disdain for the ill-prepared. The host, seemingly oblivious, soon dozed off. In the early hours, a skirmish with red ants disrupted my sleep. Gratefulness should have been my emotion. Little did I know the battalions that might have attacked at dawn. The dawn revealed the extent of their forces. Scout ants caused a moderate nuisance. A nearby cock crowed, signaling the approaching dawn. The storm intensified, reminding me it was Pentecost. The storm unleashed its fury with rain, thunder, and lightning. My host woke up.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat disrupted the speaker's sleep in the early hours?\nA) Thunderstorm\nB) Red ants\nC) Cock crowing\nD) Battalions\nE) Scout ants"", 'Question 2:\nWhat did the host do when the speaker was struggling with the red ants?\nA) Dozed off\nB) Woke up\nC) Chuckled\nD) Criticized the speaker\nE) Returned', ""Question 3:\nWhat did the speaker feel inadequate about in the spacious room?\nA) Lack of enjoyment\nB) Minimal belongings\nC) The storm\nD) The host's knowledge\nE) The naval companion's disdain"", 'Question 4:\nWhat signaled the approaching dawn in the text?\nA) Battalions\nB) Red ants\nC) Thunderstorm\nD) Cock crowing\nE) Scout ants', 'Question 5:\nWhat did the speaker feel towards the host initially?\nA) Gratefulness\nB) Sympathy\nC) Inadequacy\nD) Enjoyment\nE) Disdain', 'Question 6:\nWhat did the storm remind the speaker of?\nA) Scout ants\nB) Pentecost\nC) Battalions\nD) Naval companion\nE) Lack of enjoyment']"|['B) Red ants', 'B) Woke up', 'B) Minimal belongings', 'D) Cock crowing', 'E) Disdain', 'B) Pentecost']
The man with intelligence couldn't help but laugh, finding something amusing. As he listened, familiar words caught his attention, and he gestured for silence. The man's dark eyes held a depth he hadn't noticed before. They sparkled, then softened as he turned away. The sleeper was reciting a passage about God from the Bible, praying for blessings on all, regardless of nationality or race. Despite our initial laughter, we were moved by his sincerity.

Hood, a missionary returning from Africa, received a letter inviting him to a reunion with his Oxford friends. The letter filled him with longing for England. On his journey home, he encountered rain and sought shelter by a fire where a Mashona boy mentioned his sleeping master on a wagon. Despite the allure of sleeping under the wagon for the night, Hood and his companions decided to press on towards the railhead inn.

The travelers and Hood decided to face the approaching storm. They prayed by the warm fire before settling in for the night. Hood made his bed with a sailcloth strip and a knapsack for a pillow. As the thunder grew louder and green lightning flashed, the storm hit. Rain poured in, soaking Hood's blanket. He tried to stay dry but eventually gave in to sleep. Waking briefly to a flash of lightning, he found comfort in his pipe. The carriers rested nearby, and despite losing his pipe momentarily, Hood drifted back to sleep. By dawn, the storm had passed, and the carriers were ready to move on. Hood left the sleeping figure under the sailcloth, heading down the road, leaving the mystery unsolved.|"['1.

After drying themselves by a warm fire in a friendly hut in a village, Hood and his companion prepared for the day. It was Lady Day, and the blue-and-white blanket Hood hung up reminded him of the season. They ate breakfast and took quinine to ward off nighttime dangers. Despite feeling a bit stiff from the bath, Hood felt defiant and cheerful as they walked through the valley under the sun. Upon reaching Capetown, Hood received a letter informing him of his explorer companion's delay. Although initially disappointed, Hood embraced the idea of a solo journey. Reflecting on his school days, he booked a three-week voyage back to England. The journey was pleasant, but Hood was relieved to be back in his homeland. Summer in Berkshire brought reunions with old friends, except for one lost in Africa. The friends stayed with a bachelor host, enjoying the kindness of both married and single friends. The rector's garden was a mix of civilization and wilderness, where Hood and his companion learned about the romantic interests of the rector's sister, Perpetua, and the admiration of the keen curate.|"['1.

The farewell of the gathering arrived, but the explorer and Hood chose to stay behind while the married guests departed for their homes. They extended their stay for another week, becoming close friends with Perpetua and the curate, but decided it was best to keep their social circles separate. Perpetua joined them on a sailing trip along the Evenlode River, where they enjoyed the gentle breeze during the hay harvest. On another day, they ventured on foot to the Hinkseys, discussing poetic topics along the way. The explorer mentioned to Hood that Perpetua would be suited for Africa. The next day, the explorer fell ill with a fever, and the village doctor prescribed quinine. Hood accompanied Perpetua to Bab-lock-hythe, noticing her adventurous spirit. As they parted ways near the Martyrs' Memorial, the explorer advised Hood to stay true to their own paths and not to age prematurely like others. Reflecting on his age and experiences, Hood shared his thoughts with an old acquaintance in the college garden.|"[""1.

"His companion gazed at him thoughtfully. ""It's imaginary, youth,"" he remarked. ""Imagine trying to settle down by marrying. Imagine leaving behind your eternal youthful companion, the Great Adventure, or the High Romance, or the New Jerusalem, or whatever you call her. Picture yourself settling down with a real bride, perhaps a young woman of twenty! Imagine adhering to a routine of four meals a day in a rural vicarage. That's when you would truly realize your age."" That evening, Hood lay in his friend's spare room, peering out at the Gardens. He was perusing a college directory in bed, noting down the fates of some of his peers. Interrupting his perusal, he rose and stashed the book away. Bending to the window-sill, he noticed a book with a stained red cover. Recalling a novel from his college days two decades ago, written by a former occupant of his rooms, he brought it back to bed. Flipping through the pages, he finally found the poem he sought.

On Christmas Day last year, Hood received an important letter from Berkshire as he sat outside a school in Africa. The letter shared news of Perpetua's engagement to the curate, and they planned to marry in April or June. As Hood glanced at the clay figures gifted by Mashona children, he reflected on the poet's words about finding beauty in nature rather than domestic life. Despite his initial reservations, he decided to keep the clay family as a reminder. With a grateful heart, he bid farewell to the children and set off for home, leaving behind the school and the memories of Christmas.|"['1.

In ancient Europe, there was a belief that witches, when wounded in animal form, would bear the same wound when they returned to human form. I once witnessed a lion under the moonlight, its head surrounded by a halo. A Mashona guide with me noticed a scar on its brow, recognizing the lion by this mark. The lion stood expectantly on a rock, dividing two roads, as if waiting. I hurried back to the kraal to fetch Trooper No. 2 for a chance to shoot the lion. Unfortunately, by the time we returned, the lion had disappeared into the bush. This experience unfolded during my search for Carrot, a pioneer now fading away as civilization advanced, much like the eagle in Byron's poem.|"[""1.

In the land, a tall man named Carrot defied civilization's ways, retreating to the hill-country. Despite his efforts to escape, civilization found him, causing turmoil. I encountered him in a kraal, engaged in a fight with courtiers. Carrot, with a ragged beard and stained khaki, spoke fluently in the local tongue. A brawl erupted, involving his family, causing chaos. Despite protests, Carrot's dominance prevailed. Later, I learned of his unlawful hunting and cattle trading schemes. He aspired to open a roadside pub, defying the authorities. Carrot shared humorous anecdotes, highlighting the police's misadventures. His tales painted a picture of a man at odds with societal norms yet finding humor in the chaos.|"[""1.

After Trooper No. 1 safely moved out of the scene, he fainted from exhaustion. I quickly laid a blanket and made a pillow for him. As he slowly regained consciousness, the moon rose higher in the sky, replacing the fading sunset glow with its own brilliance. Suddenly, the sharp sound of two gunshots pierced the air. Trooper No. 2's mule dashed past us in a panic, followed by a native trooper attempting to catch it. Shortly after, Trooper No. 2 arrived, looking disheveled and defeated. No. 1 scornfully accused him of fleeing. Ignoring him, No. 1 instructed the Black Watch corporal to take three men and head to the drift, warning them to run for their lives and deviate from the path if a lion was indeed present. The Black Watch team swiftly departed. Trooper No. 2 tried to explain himself to his senior, but received no sympathy. I then decided to investigate further, asking No. 2's boy to lead me to where they had encountered the lion, questioning if it was wounded. Disdainfully, he demonstrated how Trooper No. 2 had fired his gun in a panic.|"['1.

One night, we spotted a lion under the moon's glow. I wanted to give No. 2 a chance to redeem himself. Despite my efforts to bring him along, the lion didn't wait. Surprisingly, I felt relieved when No. 2 escaped. Upon our return, a pursuer told us Carrot had crossed the border safely. The natives celebrated his escape, mocking the police. No. 1 called it a failed mission, eyeing No. 2 with disappointment. No. 2 seemed embarrassed and hurt. Not every Britisher is a hero, and No. 2's actions that night were far from heroic. Just like a misstep in a big campaign, our frontier victories can be flawed. No. 2 wasn't the only one to falter.

On a splendid autumn night in late May, under a sky filled with falling stars, I found myself in a gloomy camp among ruins. Two troopers, one convalescent and irritable, the other shaken and sulky, sat in silence. As I observed the Black Watch soldiers nearby, one shared ghostly tales of lions. I felt sorry for the troopers, their faces reflecting a mix of emotions. Later, I followed lion tracks in the light of dawn, hoping they would lead me to safety. Instead, they guided me to a hut where a fire burned, but no lion lurked. As the cock crowed, I prayed for guidance, feeling like a seeker in need of answers. The lion's mysterious presence left me in awe, with no trace of its departure.|"['1.

The helper who was injured by Carrot rested near the fire, wrapped in a colorful blanket. Despite his exhaustion, he eventually woke up, revealing a wise and watchful gaze. I tried to share the Light's message with him fervently, but he appeared confused. When I mentioned Carrot's escape, his expression changed, showing relief and affection.

Later, I sat outside with Greenwood on the sunny stoep as he pointed out the surroundings. In the distance, there was a grove of trees on a nearby ridge and a few thatched buildings nestled among them, one with a white cross on top. Greenwood suggested we visit the Hospice of Saint Lucy to share its story before nightfall, believing it could aid in healing. As the sun set, we set off with his native helpers, each carrying packs. The Hospice, unlike a modern hospital, was a round church with a charming and costly interior. It housed aids for recovery, including a life-sized image of Saint Lucy with a lantern in hand, set against an African forest backdrop. The atmosphere was serene, with a red cock crowing in the foreground and stars shining brightly. Despite my curiosity, Greenwood saved the tale of the place for the Shrine itself, making it clear it was unlike any other story.|['1.

We visited the Church with just one candle. The purple lamp glowed, protecting flies with its mesh cup. Kneeling beneath it, he led the Shrine Prayers. After our own prayers, he began sharing his journey: returning from England via the East Coast, passing Zanzibar, where he spent nights in a palm grove. Boarding the boat for a voyage to Beira, he met a girl during a Concert. She had a powerful presence, inspiring him with her words under the moonlit sky. Despite his leisurely trip, she showed him the fervor and determination in her heart. Their conversation was illuminating, discussing Saint Vincent of Paris and the devotion of men in distant lands. As she bid good night, her kindness lingered, leaving a profound impact.|"['1.

Greenwood, after finishing his tasks, demonstrated the Shrine's operations to me. A young mother, adorned and dignified, approached with her baby. The child, nearly unclothed but adorned with beads, was carried on the mother's back in a colorful sheepskin. Greenwood covered his head with a faded blue and silver handkerchief from the Altar, then offered prayers to the Father, Christ, and Saints Lucy and others. Other visitors followed, and Greenwood asked a few to deliver letters to a town doctor, anointing them with oil from the Shrine lamp. Later, three young men arrived with a troubled boy who had been silent and wandering since returning from work. Greenwood welcomed the boy to stay, hoping for a miracle. The men left, one playing a marimba, evoking a sense of joy and reminiscent of old pilgrimages. Greenwood expressed his search for a mysterious healer, acknowledging the power of simple remedies and comparing certain individuals to trees with healing qualities.|"[""1.

We climbed steps to the upper deck. Few lights were on. He stopped and looked around to check if anyone was listening. But that night, he couldn't tell me.

"Dear Sir,

I have been struggling with my fear and prejudice towards people of color, which I refer to as my ""negrophoby."" It feels impossible to rid myself of this deep-rooted feeling. However, after a spiritual experience, I am compelled to confront my fears by taking a symbolic plunge into the sea. I fear that like Macbeth's inability to wash away his guilt, I may not be able to cleanse myself of my prejudice. The idea of my presence darkening the sea troubles me deeply.

Reflecting on the consequences of my actions, I wonder if seeking help earlier could have prevented this turmoil. The Superintendent of Missions urges me to embrace change and serve with courage. While recruitment is needed, he advises me to make the decision in my own time.

Sincerely, [Your Name]"|"['1.

He talked about important days for God's priests, hoping the war would end soon. Later, when they sat on the porch in the lamplight, the conversation would slow down. The layman seemed lost in thought between his courteous gestures. The Superintendent studied him closely, finding him mysterious. He felt he misjudged him in conversations. Why was he different? Probably due to his long solitary life on the veld. The Superintendent distrusted the wild veld and its people, but his kindness and duty fought against it. He stayed at my place and followed me, walking thirty miles to catch up. He enjoyed the solitude for deep thinking. I found him on a ledge overlooking the Sawi River and Wedza hills at sunset. He shared the Superintendent's perspective, finding some justification for his actions. He pressed me to speak my mind about war and its philosophies, knowing I had changed after experiencing it.|"['1.

With three or four white men aboard the train's engine, a few Black Watch soldiers, and some native passengers on the wagons, the locomotive chugged through the forest. As night fell and the moon rose, we neared the final stop for the evening and set up camp. A local Basuto offered me some water, though clean water was scarce. My companions went off to find water and returned with a strange liquid-solid mix. It was safe to drink but not very appealing. That night, I had a dream influenced by Marvell's words and the quinine I had taken before sleeping. The dream featured Malaria personified as a sickly figure fleeing into the wilderness.

Our guide was not a skinny child; he was strong and had a beard, a skilled woodsman. The trees yielded to his powerful swing. But his work took time. We felt embarrassed by the long distances we covered each day. Sunday was a welcome break, and we camped in the rocky area, thankful for the rest. The next day showed the results of our break. We traveled bravely for hours, easily crossing a swamp and even attempting a difficult river crossing before resting. But success eluded us until we admitted defeat and rested again. The night brought challenges as we got stuck at a stream, facing rocks and deep mud. The lady from the wagon lightened the load and helped maneuver the wagon. Eventually, we overcame the obstacles. The evening was spent by the fire, discussing our journey, with the lady roasting nuts and us smoking tobacco. Anson praised Mashonaland, calling it a blessed land.

When I described the scenes to Dick, he battled my praises impartially, feeling deeply wounded by his impending banishment. Despite his unfortunate fate, he expressed a desire to return someday. He revealed his chosen burial site where two rivers met, far from our current camp. As we conversed, Delia Moore intervened after roasting monkey-nuts. She believed our paths were predetermined - Dick to depart and me to remain. She felt compelled to move due to church pressure, unsure of gathering any moss. I promised to tend to her west-country work. Reflecting on Africa's essence, I pondered its birth star, symbolized by the Southern Cross. Delia engaged Dick in a spirited debate, while I marveled at the starlit sky above, contemplating Africa's enigmatic ways in guiding our destinies.|"['1.

I asked for a day's grace, then defended Africa's femininity. I explained that like a woman at the height of her power with a man, Africa sends Dick away to remember her. It may seem bitter now, but will turn sweet later. A donkey chewing on a pillow-slip caused a commotion. After the mishap, we sat by the fire. Tired, I promised to go to bed after talking. Africa keeps me hanging around, showing me isolated places to work. She knows my weaknesses, making me stay longer. I pledged to stay another day, feeling bound to her. In the morning, I reaffirmed my commitment at a lichen-stained rock altar. We shared breakfast and I gave Dick a motto about Africa.|"[""1.

In the morning, we searched fruitlessly for a dhow, a type of boat, in creeks and inlets. The light we saw may have come from a German steam-tug. The gunnery-lieutenant suspected something shady in the German harbor. Perhaps they were just transporting food. Despite our patrol's efforts, the dhow's light vanished, leaving us puzzled. A bluejacket shared a tale from a few nights ago, linking a particular tune to luck. He believed we missed an opportunity by not following the light. Maybe we could have achieved more, like capturing Muanza, but our cautious captain held us back. The bluejacket thought the light was a sign, a chance we missed.|"['1.
