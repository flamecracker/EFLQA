Around two o'clock in the afternoon, Frank was resting on a bench in City-Hall Park when a ten-year-old girl approached him. She was from the same tenement-house where Mills, Frank's former boss, lived. Mills became angry as he learned from the girl what Frank had said. He regretted losing Frank, realizing he was a truthful and reliable guide. Mills considered falsely accusing Frank of theft but feared being linked to counterfeit money. Instead, he hired another boy who stole from him and later a girl, paying her mother twenty cents each time she worked. Frank, energetic and alert, excelled in his new job, outearning his peer Dick. The two boys attended a performance at the theater, where Dick's enthusiasm for violent scenes contrasted with Frank's sensible nature. Frank, having lived within his means, saved a quarter from his initial dollar.

"Frank was surprised when Victor, not recognizing him, said coldly, ""I don't think I remember you."" Feeling self-conscious about his shabby clothes, Frank worried Mr. Bowen had forgotten the invitation. However, Susan, a kind soul, suggested to her master that Frank needed better attire. The old gentleman, delighted for the task, chose a complete outfit for Frank. The new gray suit, with neat studs and sleeve-buttons, transformed Frank's appearance.

Six weeks later, Frank found himself in the uniform of a District Telegraph Messenger through his patron's influence. The blue suit and badge on the cap are recognizable to city residents. The company provides the uniform but deducts weekly payments from the messengers' wages. Luckily, Mr. Bowen's ten-dollar gift almost covered Frank's suit expenses. In the city, many homes and offices connect to the District Telegraph through machines. Messengers can be summoned anytime by raising a knob in the box, ringing a bell at the office. At the office, boys wait their turn for assignments. Frank was once sent on a late-night errand to a worried mother seeking her son led astray by bad companions. She entrusted him with money, hoping to show trust, but feared his involvement in drinking and gambling.|"['1.

Victor looked toward Mrs. Vivian and was equally surprised and disgusted to see Frank, the country-boy he once looked down upon, now impeccably dressed with gloves, a rose in his buttonhole, and appearing gentlemanly.

When Frank had saved ten dollars, he went to the Dime Savings-Bank on Canal Street to deposit it. He received a bank-book, feeling proud.

Mr. Haynes was being closely observed, both at work and outside the store, to check for any unexplained spending or suspicious friends.

It might turn out that he was completely trustworthy, a respected member of the church and society with just a bit of a gruff demeanor. If this was the case, the suspicions would be corrected, and trust would be restored. Meanwhile, Frank received a letter from his uncle, Deacon Pelatiah Kavanagh, mentioning an old trunk of his father's with clothes that might fit Frank. The letter advised Frank to be thrifty, avoid city temptations, and lead a modest life to achieve success.

Frank easily identified his residence, a modest brick house on Waverley Place. To uncover the cost of his living arrangements, Frank pretended to seek board at the house.
