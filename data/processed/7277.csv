This is the third of the Fairy Books, following the Blue and Red Fairy Books. These stories come from various countries like France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Scotland, England, and China. People of all nations enjoy fairy tales because they were once childlike in their minds. Before newspapers and novels, they entertained each other with stories of witches, talking beasts, and magic rings. These tales, older than reading and writing, were passed down through generations. While some stories aim to teach goodness, most are for entertainment. Even though some say fairy tales are not suitable for children, readers understand the balance between truth and make-believe. These stories, filled with monsters and magic, no longer frighten us, but continue to captivate both children and adults.|"[""1.

Once upon a time, there was a King with a daughter named Fiordelisa, who was fifteen years old. She was the most charming and prettiest Princess, always cheerful and happy. The new Queen had a daughter named Turritella, who was brought up by the Fairy Mazilla but was neither beautiful nor kind. When the King decided it was time for Fiordelisa and Turritella to marry, the Queen tried to turn the King against Fiordelisa in favor of Turritella. A Prince named King Charming was to visit, and the Queen prepared Turritella with splendid attire while sabotaging Fiordelisa's wardrobe. Despite this, King Charming preferred Fiordelisa's genuine nature over Turritella's appearance. The jealous Queen then had Fiordelisa hidden away during King Charming's visit.

The Queen sent King Charming beautiful gifts, including a heart-shaped jewel made for the upcoming wedding. The King, however, declined the gifts as they were from Turritella, not Fiordelisa. Desperate to see Fiordelisa, the King's squire arranged a secret meeting. Turritella, pretending to be Fiordelisa, accepted the King's proposal.

They arrived at the Fairy Mazilla's castle, where Turritella revealed her true identity and the plan to deceive King Charming.

The Fairy Mazilla was furious with the King's obstinacy and gave him a choice: marry her goddaughter or be a Blue Bird for seven years as penance. The King insulted the Fairy and was promptly transformed into a Blue Bird with bright blue feathers and a crown of white feathers. Meanwhile, the Queen and Turritella deceived Princess Fiordelisa into thinking that King Charming had married Turritella. Heartbroken, Fiordelisa fainted in despair. The cruel Queen decided to keep Fiordelisa locked in the tower until she came to her senses. Unbeknownst to them, King Charming, now the Blue Bird, overheard Fiordelisa's lamentations and realized the truth.

The Blue Bird was surprised and eagerly awaited the dawn to find out who had spoken to him. The next night, under the moonlight, he saw it was Fiordelisa. She shared how Turritella, disguised as a bride, had visited her wearing the royal mantle and crown he gave her. The Blue Bird, enraged, explained how he was tricked by the Fairy Mazilla into carrying off Turritella. Fiordelisa was relieved to know his loyalty. The Blue Bird promised to return and gifted her a diamond ring. Despite the risks, he brought her treasures each night. Fiordelisa treasured the gifts and hid them by day. The Blue Bird sang to her from the tall fir-tree, and two years passed with the Princess still a prisoner.

Fiordelisa and Turritella went up into the tower near midnight. Fiordelisa, adorned with jewels, sat at the window with the Blue Bird. The Queen overheard them singing a song about their troubles.

The Queen shared her quest for the Blue Bird with a kind old woman who transformed into a beautiful lady. She gave the Queen four eggs for aid in times of trouble. Using one egg's gold hooks, the Queen climbed a steep ivory hill. At the top, she found a magic mirror reflecting people's desires. A chariot from another egg carried her to King Charming's kingdom. Disguised, she learned the King would marry Princess Turritella. Heartbroken, she offered emerald bracelets to the King, who recognized them. Overwhelmed with memories, the King was speechless. Turritella, eager for his attention, asked him the bracelets' worth. Caught in his emotions, the King struggled to respond, lost in thoughts of the Queen.|"['1.

The King chose not to investigate the origin of the bracelets, not because he lacked curiosity, but because he avoided speaking to Turritella, whom he disliked. Fiordelisa, seeking to confront the King for his unfaithfulness, remembered the Chamber of Echoes, a room where whispers were heard in the King's chamber. To gain the King's attention, she broke magical eggs revealing a carriage drawn by mice and a pie with singing birds. The King, overhearing Fiordelisa's grief through the Chamber of Echoes, realized her true identity. With the help of an Enchanter and a Fairy, the obstacles were overcome, and the King and Fiordelisa were able to marry, much to Turritella's dismay as she was transformed into an owl.

For a few days, the storks relaxed and lived off fruits, struggling to eat with their long bills. They avoided frogs and lizards. Flying was their solace, and they often soared over Bagdad to observe the city's happenings. After days of unrest, a grand procession caught their attention. Amidst the drums and trumpets, a man in opulent attire rode a horse, hailed as Mirza, the Lord of Bagdad. Caliph Chasid, one of the storks, realized Mirza was the son of his enemy, the magician Kaschnur. Determined, Chasid sought the Prophet's grave to break the spell. As evening neared, they sought refuge in a ruined castle. Inside, they heard weeping and found a sorrowful screech owl. The owl, speaking in human Arabic, shared its woes, seeking their aid.

Once upon a time, the Caliph listened attentively as the owl shared her tale of woe. The owl revealed that she was Princess Lusa, cursed by the evil magician Kaschnur after her father, the King of the Indies, rejected his proposal for her hand in marriage.

Rosimond advised the father that he should have corrected the King's son without punishment. Rosimond then took the elder son with him and instructed guards to escort the father to a specific location. Meanwhile, Rosimond, pretending to be the lost Prince, returned to the kingdom, bringing joy and celebration. The false Prince confessed to his real brother, Bramintho, and sought forgiveness. Rosimond forgave Bramintho and spared his life, showing mercy. Rosimond later revealed his true identity to his mother and helped in a war against a wicked King, ensuring peace. The Fairy warned Rosimond not to marry anyone who believed him to be a Prince and urged him to find the real Prince to restore justice.|"[""1.

Rosimond embraced the wise advice he received. He pretended to embark on a clandestine mission to a nearby land and set sail on a ship that led him directly to the island where the Fairy had foretold the true Prince's location. The unfortunate Prince had been held captive by a savage tribe to watch over their sheep. Rosimond, using his power of invisibility, located the Prince in the pastures and rescued him from his cruel captors, returning him to the ship. The winds guided by the Fairy propelled the ship back to the King's court where the two young men appeared before the King. Rosimond revealed the truth, presenting the Prince to his father. The King, astonished, struggled to comprehend the situation until Rosimond, using the ring, assumed the Prince's appearance. Rosimond declined rewards and only requested a position at court for his brother. He then returned the ring to the Fairy, preferring a simple life away from courtly temptations. Meanwhile, Bramintho, driven by greed, misused the ring for personal gain, leading to his downfall.|"['1.

Once upon a time, there was a young man named Bramintho who boasted of possessing a ring that made him invisible. However, his crimes caught up with him when he was seized by the King and his ring was taken away. Despite his brother Rosimond's pleas for mercy, Bramintho was put to death. To console Rosimond, the King returned the enchanted ring. Rosimond, realizing the ring's dangers, returned it to the Fairy in the woods, asking her never to give it to anyone dear to him. In another tale, a young man found a snuff-box that granted his wishes.

When night fell, the soldier struggled to stay awake, jumping up frequently. At dawn, unable to lie still any longer, he climbed out into a lime-tree. Gazing at his bouquet, he drifted to sleep. Despite the noise around him, nothing could rouse him. Feeling bewitched, he tied a scented scarf around his arm to stay awake. Buying a horse, he stood determined outside the inn.
