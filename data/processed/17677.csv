It was a quiet afternoon at the two-story white house with green shutters, locked and sealed by the army.

Trumpets blared, signaling the charge into the pit, where white and black troops rushed to sever the Southern line. Colonel Winchester hesitated, holding his regiment in reserve. As the Union troops charged, Dick realized they faced seasoned veterans led by Mahone. The Confederates unleashed a barrage of fire, trapping the Union soldiers in the deadly crater.

"""It's magnificent to ride a horse again, with the world spread out before you,"" Pennington exclaimed. ""I practically grew up on horseback, and I never had to walk until this war. The vast plains and the untamed winds that sweep across the earth, they're what I long for.""

They were on the highest hill, the cavalry behind them taking a final look. Dick noticed flashes of rifle fire and smoke rising from the crater, a grim reminder of the war.

Despite the desolation, they pressed forward, encountering hidden threats from sharpshooters. The skirmishes intensified, prompting the colonels to deploy skirmishers to fend off the elusive enemy.

He might be concealed amidst the rose bushes in the garden, observing for a subtle signal from her hand. The open window possibly obscured the faint sign, intended only for him.

"Dick and his friends remained silent for a long time, their thoughts mirroring each other's. To young ones, a year feels like an eternity, and two years seem almost like a lifetime. After enduring three years of war, conflict had become their norm. They had never truly pondered what would follow the great divide between North and South. Now, they grasped that peace, not battle, was the natural order that must return. As the moonlight waned and the stars dimmed, the darkness preceding dawn crept in. The ethereal glow dissipated, and the troop appeared as a spectral caravan traveling through the twilight. Shepard guided them along a road that meandered through picturesque hills and babbling streams. Despite vigilant scouts, many men dozed in their saddles.

Throughout the day, they journeyed through a desolate and unfriendly area. It was a place deeply rooted in Southern loyalties, yet it appeared deserted, with even women and children having fled. The absence of horses and cattle added to the eerie emptiness of what was once a bustling community. Encountering only distant watchmen signaling from hills, the group eventually halted at a meadow beside a clear stream to rest. The men and horses, weary from lack of sleep and the rigors of war, gratefully dismounted for a much-needed break. After quenching their thirst and enjoying a brief respite, they eagerly discussed the upcoming battle with Sheridan in the nearby valley. Despite the anticipation of conflict, Dick found solace in the lush greenery of the mountains ahead, a stark contrast to the barren landscape they traversed.

In the afternoon, while passing through a forest, shots were fired at them. Luckily, only one man was slightly injured. Dick led a brief chase but found no one. The shooters likely escaped. Colonel Hertford seemed relieved. The group continued marching, feeling the heat and dust. As they neared the green mountains, Dick and his companions admired the shade. Acknowledging the unique character of Vermont, Dick appreciated the sunset over the states. Night fell dark and damp as they rode through the gap cautiously.

He gazed up at the dark hills, only seeing the thick rain and dense foliage. His mind conjured up the wilderness in all its wild and majestic solitude. Imagining lurking Indians, bears, and panthers added to the thrill. Despite the obstacles, he felt safe and content. Riding alongside him, Sergeant Whitley shared similar experiences from the plains and the fort during winter storms.

The wind howled and rain sheets flew, making eerie sounds in the dark forest. Dick, unfazed, noticed a figure with a rifle, likely Slade, a notorious guerrilla leader. Ready to shoot, Dick's sergeant aimed but missed as Slade vanished. Shots were exchanged, but no harm was done. Dick decided to wait for backup, knowing their foes couldn't.

The rain stopped, and the wind's moaning turned into a gentle murmur. The clouds cleared, revealing a vast sky with a bright moon and countless stars.

Onward they journeyed through day and night, nearing Sheridan's camp. Blue-clad scouts greeted them, their sabers saluting the approaching column. Word spread of Sheridan's growing army, eagerly awaiting Colonel Hertford's reinforcement from General Grant. The three esteemed colonels' reputation preceded them. As they reached the valley's northern end, a horseman with a small group raced towards them. The leader, a short yet resolute man, approached. Colonel Hertford signaled his troopers to halt, awaiting the new commander's arrival. Sheridan, a compact figure exuding vigor, reciprocated the salute with fervor.

Dick observed the skilled military organization of Sheridan's formidable army, comprising nearly thirty thousand seasoned troops led by able generals like Wright, Emory, Crook, and others. Sheridan's thorough knowledge of the terrain, aided by his engineer lieutenant Meigs, allowed him to understand the valley's geography as well as his Confederate opponent, Early. Despite anticipating immediate action, Dick and his comrades enjoyed their camp, making new friends as they awaited orders from Washington. Transitioning from summer to autumn, the lads relished the cooler air and vast space, occasionally joining cavalry patrols near Confederate lines. Encountering familiar faces among Southern officers, Dick exchanged waves, relishing the brief respite from conflict.

Warner remained silent as Dick and Pennington continued to tease him about his lack of luck in fishing. They insinuated that there were no fish in Vermont and doubted if the state even had rivers. Despite the taunts, Warner stayed focused on his cork, hoping for a bite. Eventually, after a long wait, there was a sudden jerk on his line. With a mighty pull, Warner landed a magnificent two-foot-long fish, the largest catch of the day. As he detached the hook and admired his prize, Dick and Pennington rushed over to see. Warner calmly addressed the fish, expressing his patience and triumph. The trio's luck changed, and they all began to catch fish successfully.

Dick and Warner found themselves fishing by the stream when they noticed peculiar chips floating by. Upon closer inspection, Dick discovered a message carved on one of the chips, warning them away. Speculating that it could be a message from his cousin Harry, they debated the origin and intent of the warning.

Pennington swiftly climbed the tall elm tree and from its highest branch, he spotted open fields and more woods. He assured his friends that no humans were in sight and that he would stay a while longer to keep watch. Meanwhile, Dick's attention shifted to the river, noticing no more floating debris but catching a glimpse of a large hat across the water. Realizing it was Slade and his men nearby, Dick urgently signaled Pennington. Startled, Pennington hurried down the tree with his catch and a pistol. As they heard gunshots, Dick commanded a quick retreat. Dodging the bullets, they sprinted, then dropped behind a hill, out of harm's way. Warner expressed displeasure at the undignified escape, vowing revenge on Slade.

Young officers were impatient, and the North was restless. Criticisms of Sheridan arose, but Dick trusted him. Plans were brewing beneath the surface, and the armies would soon move. Sheridan's energy and leadership impressed Dick, likening him to the North's Stonewall Jackson. The army felt invigorated by his presence, even though they hadn't mobilized yet.

One day, the Northern army showed signs of movement, preparing wagons and cavalry. Despite initial excitement, the orders were canceled, leaving the troops disappointed. Dick, a young soldier, trusted there was a reason behind the change. Suddenly, they were called to saddle up quickly to ride with Sheridan, a significant mission. As they eagerly awaited, a message arrived, leading them to mount up swiftly. Riding with Sheridan and his staff, the troops felt the urgency of the moment. When they reached Charlestown, they met General Grant, the Commander-in-Chief. Grant and Sheridan discussed a crucial plan, with Grant ultimately deferring to Sheridan's strategy.

The cavalry charged ahead, their sabers gleaming in the sunlight as they galloped towards the enemy. Bullets from Southern sharpshooters whizzed past, felling some horses and riders, but the cavalry pressed on undeterred. Dick, wielding his saber with gusto, joined in the battle cry. As they reached the Opequan River, the Southern skirmishers intensified their fire, but the cavalry surged forward, trampling through the water without hesitation. Emerging from the river, drenched but undaunted, they continued their charge, driving the enemy back. Despite facing a small earthwork defended by cannons, the cavalry seized it, forcing the Southern infantry to retreat. As the battle raged on, Dick and his comrades awaited further orders, witnessing the conflict unfold across the valley.

The morning was still young, with the east bright and the west slowly glowing. The rifles and cannons roared in the distance as the defending Southern force unleashed their fiery barrage. Pennington pointed out rebel figures to his friend Dick, recognizing Colonel Talbot and Lieutenant Colonel St. Hilaire leading the charge. As the Invincibles prepared to charge, Dick felt a mix of emotions, knowing his cousin and friends were among them. The Southern infantry and artillery intensified their attack, but the Invincibles stood firm. Dick watched as they readied for the charge, hearts pounding with anticipation.

He watched as the gray horsemen charged through a cloud of fire and smoke, glimpsing the flash of sabers. The intense combat felt like an eternity to Dick, though it lasted only moments. The blue infantry faltered, pushed back by the Invincibles' charge. Dick wanted to cheer but held back, feeling a pang of guilt for a fleeting doubt in his cause. Straining to see through his glasses, he couldn't discern if any of his comrades had fallen. The cavalry returned victorious, but casualties were evident with riderless horses galloping. Sheridan, leading the charge, electrified the troops with his presence. Despite valiant Southern resistance, the battle raged on. The Southern riflemen hid among trees, firing relentlessly. As the day wore on, the battle remained deadlocked, with neither side gaining ground. Sheridan's troops awaited reinforcements, engaging in a prolonged battle of cannons and rifles.

"Warner was thrilled and shouted, ""We win! We win!"" Dick and Pennington joined in, echoing the victory cry. The Union army, led by Sheridan, was triumphant, pushing the enemy back towards Winchester. Despite the Southern troops giving ground, Early and his veterans showed immense courage. The Invincibles bravely covered the retreat, facing the full force of the Union attack. The colonels, Leonidas and Hector, acknowledged the masterly retreat. As darkness fell, the exhausted soldiers held their ground, repelling Northern cavalry. Although the North claimed victory, the South's resilience was evident.

"""It's a good guess, Dick,"" Warner remarked. ""But isn't it beautiful here at this time and place? The birds must be singing their hearts out. I doubt they've ever sounded better."" Dick and his friends were witnessing a scene in the valley under Sheridan similar to what Harry and his comrades had seen under Stonewall Jackson earlier in the war. The men all felt reassured that they were under a strong and clear leadership. They were confident that there would be no more wasteful losses. Sheridan had a strong army and equipment, and he would utilize them fully. As the trumpets sounded before dawn, the men were ready to ride southward. They left Winchester behind and approached the Massanuttons, a range dividing the valley. When they reached Fisher's Hill, Dick observed the Confederate defenses through his glasses. Despite the tension of war, the picturesque valley with its woods and fields appealed to Dick's romantic side. Sheridan arrived, surveyed the Southern defenses, and held a council with his generals. Warner predicted that they wouldn't fight that afternoon but would ride through the night. The day ended with troops being positioned across the valley, ready for the next move."|"['1.

"""Dick,"" he said, ""Mr. Shepard believes valuable information can be gathered on the mountain. He suspects there might be some fighting, so it's best for a small group to accompany him. I've chosen you to lead because of your familiarity with the woods."" The group consisted of about a dozen members, with Shepard as their guide. They dismounted as the terrain was too steep for horses. Armed heavily, they were certain of encountering Southern riflemen on Massanutton Mountain. Dick and Shepard led the way, disappearing quickly from view as they ascended sharply. The party paused 200 yards up, overlooking the valley with its campfires glowing in the distance. The peaceful scene contrasted with the imminent battle they anticipated. Shepard expressed confidence in their victory and the impending end of the Confederacy.

Dick overheard the sergeant's alertness to the approaching Confederate troopers down the ravine. The troopers, unaware of Shepard's troop, scouted past without detecting their trail. Shepard advised silence, suspecting the troopers to return soon. They decided to leave the ravine quietly. Sergeant Whitley discovered threads from a woman's dress caught on a thorn bush nearby. The threads led up the mountain, showing evidence of city shoes, not mountain women's footwear. Shepard, usually composed, showed signs of excitement, hinting at knowing the woman's identity. A few heel prints confirmed a woman's presence. The group remained still as the spy hinted at knowing the woman's identity and proposed an experiment.|"[""1.

A man took out a small whistle and blew softly on it. The sound was gentle and melodic, unlike the shrill whistle of another person. His excitement grew evident, and Dick sensed something extraordinary was about to happen. As they awaited, a light footstep approached confidently. A woman emerged from the bushes, standing boldly before them. Despite her small and elderly appearance, she exuded courage and resolution. With bright, intelligent eyes and a firm chin, she bore a striking resemblance to someone familiar. Shepard introduced her as his sister, who also faced dangers bravely.

In silence, the group removed their caps, knowing the enemy lurked nearby. The woman, confident and proud, held a riding whip. Shepard, acknowledging her presence, asked about the information she brought. She revealed a plan to flank the Confederates, hidden in the timber along Cedar Creek. Providing a map, she vanished swiftly. The group, led by Lieutenant Mason, prepared for the imminent danger. The sergeant, experienced in forest warfare, advised caution as they awaited the enemy's approach. Sergeant Whitley warned of the creeping foe, urging the group to stay low.

Pennington expressed his agreement, acknowledging the fear of unseen dangers. He compared his feelings to being stalked by lions in the African wilderness at night. He whispered about spotting Slade and an evil-looking companion among the bushes. Pennington proposed a plan to take cover in a nearby gully, surprise the enemies, and open fire. They cautiously moved into the gully as instructed by the sergeant, maintaining silence to avoid detection. As they crept forward, Dick imagined himself in a historical wilderness setting, feeling a mix of excitement and readiness.

Sheridan, a young and confident leader, inspired his troops with his fiery words as they prepared for battle. The September morning was bright, and the Confederate outposts were visible in the distance. Despite the early rifle shots, Sheridan remained calm, knowing it was just the beginning. As his men rested, Sheridan strategized, moving them like chess pieces. He was determined to make a mark in the valley, following in the footsteps of legendary generals like Stonewall Jackson. Throughout the day, the sound of gunfire filled the air, but Sheridan remained focused on his plan. By nightfall, his forces were positioned strategically, ready for the next phase of the battle. With Shepard's guidance and a well-executed strategy, Sheridan was poised for success as they advanced under the cover of darkness.|"[""1.

"""They're going well, Mr. Mason,"" said Shepard, ""because everything is arranged. There is provision against every unlucky chance. It's leadership. The difference between a good general and a bad general is about fifty thousand men."" The entire division moved forward in the dusk at a fair pace, but so many troops with cavalry and guns could not keep from making some noise. Dick with Shepard and the sergeant rode off in the woods towards the open valley to see if the enemy were observing them. Dick's chief apprehensions were in regard to Slade and Skelly, but they found no trace of the guerrillas, nor of any other foes. The night was fairly bright, and from the edge of the wood, they saw far over hills and fields, dotted with two opposing lines of campfires. A dark outline was Fisher's Hill, and lights burned there too. From a point in front of it, a gun boomed now and then, and there was still an intermittent fire of skirmishers and sharpshooters. ""That hill will be ours inside of twenty-four hours,"" said Shepard. ""We'll fall upon Early from three sides and he'll have to retreat to save himself.

The long and difficult retreat lasted for an extended period, with the entire Union army being pushed back a significant five miles before they could establish a solid defense. Eventually, in the early morning, the regiments regrouped, held their position, and Dick, for the first time, felt a sense of relief. Despite the challenges faced during the retreat, Dick noticed that the Confederate soldiers couldn't resist the temptation to seize and consume the Union army's supplies, causing disorder among their ranks. However, with the arrival of General Sheridan, the Union soldiers were revitalized and inspired. His presence alone ignited a renewed sense of determination and courage among the troops, transforming a defeated and demoralized army into a united and enthusiastic force ready to face the enemy once more.|"['1.

They say he's a splendid swearer, one of the greatest that ever lived, but he won't be able to get out a single cuss, with you standing before him, and spouting the whole unabridged dictionary to him.""

""At least when I talk I say something,"" replied Warner sternly. ""It seems strange to me, Frank Pennington, that your life on the plains, where conditions, for the present at least, are hard, has permitted you to have so much frivolity in your nature.""

""No, I don't, and I'm not going to bother about it. I'll leave that directly to Colonel Winchester, and indirectly to General Sheridan. When you rest, put your mind at rest. Concentration on whatever you are doing is the secret of continued success.""

The military leader felt elated and blew a soft hunting call on his silver whistle, prompting his troops to pick up the pace, leaving a white trail of snow in their wake. Despite the soldiers' cheer and high spirits, the valley they rode through appeared desolate and abandoned in the winter, with no signs of life or warmth.

Dick felt a growing sense of oppression as a mysterious danger loomed in the valley. Uncertainty gripped him as he tried to anticipate the impending attack. The soldiers remained silent, their steps muffled by the snow. Suddenly, the calm was shattered by the stampede of terrified horses, driven by fear towards the valley entrance. With quick thinking and courage, the guards wielded burning brands to redirect the panicked herd. Amidst the chaos, Colonel Winchester and his men swiftly organized a defense, positioning themselves strategically. Despite the escalating gunfire and losses, their determination remained unshaken. As darkness enveloped the valley, the colonel's calm leadership and the soldiers' bravery were their strongest defense against the unseen threat lurking in the shadows.|"['1.

The mountaineer shared that only two people, Leonard and Bosley, might have betrayed them. Bosley, recognizable by his gray comfort and raccoon cap, had hidden behind a pine tree and fired at them. The mountaineer, armed with a cap and ball rifle, aimed to settle the score himself. He carefully loaded his rifle, took aim at Bosley, and shot him down the snowy slope. He explained that he gave Bosley time to pray before taking the shot.

Dick left quickly with a message for the captain in charge of guarding the valley entrance. He hurried under the tree cover and crawled the rest of the way to reach the captain safely. Warner was already there, and they were under heavy fire from the slopes. Warner noted that the guerrillas hadn't attempted to breach the gateway since their failed horse attack. The sharpshooters were effective, evident by the fallen guerrillas on the slopes. Despite the defense, Colonel Winchester felt uneasy about being besieged by guerrillas they had come to capture. He grappled with the reversal of roles, now defending instead of attacking. The colonel, disappointed by the losses on both sides, observed the guerrillas' strategic use of cover. He pondered a new plan to fulfill their mission as the battle raged on.|"['1.

Colonel Winchester, along with his trusted mountaineer Mr. Reed, devised a bold plan to flank the enemy forces. They proposed sending a detachment through a pass to attack from above, a risky but strategic move. Reed suggested a select group of men, including the skilled guide Shepard and the reliable sergeant, to lead the mission. Despite initial hesitations, the Colonel chose young officer Dick to lead the one hundred and fifty men. The group, aided by the cover of darkness and falling snow, stealthily made their way through the gorge towards the enemy. Dick, feeling the weight of responsibility, led his men silently, taking advantage of the increasing darkness for cover. As they advanced, the snowfall intensified, providing them with additional concealment.|['1.

After the first bend, the stream swiftly descended, allowing two people to walk side by side. The valley vanished from view, drowned out by the booming rifle shots. Colonel Winchester followed Lee and Jackson's plan, launching a heavy attack once his flanking troops disappeared into the gorge. Reed whispered optimistically about turning the tables on their ambushing foes. Dick felt fortunate as snow fell, masking their movements. They halted a mile away, shielded by the cedars. Despite the firing below, they advanced stealthily. Reed hoped to confront the traitor Leonard. Unseen, they reached the crest, hearing the ongoing battle. Dick led his men forward, firing at the guerrillas. The mountain echoed their victorious cries. With determination, they charged, overwhelming the enemy.|"[""1.

A loud cheer echoed through the valley as Colonel Winchester heard the gunfire on the side. He realized his plan had succeeded, thanks to the skillful execution by one of his lieutenants. As his own troops advanced up the slopes, they fired at the guerrillas who were starting to retreat. Dick's troop inflicted heavy losses on the guerrillas, who struggled in the deep snow. Suddenly, Reed spotted Leonard, an enemy, and took a shot. Despite Slade's attempts to regroup his men, Dick focused on his pursuit. The guerrillas trapped on the valley's edge were overwhelmed by a snow avalanche, leading to their capture. Dick and his men continued to chase the remaining band, showing no mercy to the robbers and murderers. Though Slade escaped, the victory was undeniable as the brigand force was scattered and defeated.|"[""1.

Sergeant Whitley and Shepard swiftly and expertly bandaged Dick's head after Slade's bullet grazed him. The wound was minor, and the bandage halted the bleeding. Despite the sting, Dick didn't feel it due to his triumph. He led his men back to the valley, feeling light and energetic after the successful operation. Colonel Winchester greeted him warmly, acknowledging his achievement. Warner and Pennington praised him, foreseeing his promotion. The soldiers, in high spirits, added wood to the fires, lighting up the valley. The captives, in worn uniforms, watched with guilty eyes. Colonel Winchester bound the most dangerous, preparing to take them to General Sheridan. The captives, fearing their fate, huddled by the fire. Reed, a mountaineer, assisted in fortifying the troops' shelters. Despite his wound, Dick couldn't sleep, his mind still buzzing with the day's events.|"[""1.

Dick observed the roaring fire and the constant movement of people in front of the bright flames. He noticed the captives huddled together, with the bayonets of the guards gleaming in the red light. Warner and Pendleton entered one of the lean-tos, while Colonel Winchester, accompanied by Shepard and the sergeant, headed down the valley.After some time, the prisoners sought refuge in the lean-tos as everyone sought shelter. The crackling fires turned into a hissing sound as more smoke billowed. The reason was clearâ€”the snow had stopped falling, replaced by heavy rain. Reed's warning had been timely.The rain intensified, drumming on the windows and roof. All the fires were extinguished, and mist veiled the surroundings. The comforting feeling of being indoors during a storm enveloped Dick. He drifted off to sleep, awakened only at noon to a transformed world outside. The rain had frozen the snow, creating a dazzling but unforgiving icy landscape. The group was stranded due to the icy conditions, but spirits remained high, with plans to wait for a thaw.|['1.

The icy water splashed on his face, making his heart dance with joy. Suddenly, he felt like a carefree boy again, pondering on how to spend time while trapped in the frost. After breakfast, he met with Colonel Winchester and other officers to discuss their predicament. The consensus was clear - they had to wait for the ice to thaw. Meanwhile, Shepard and a few others set out to inform Sheridan about their situation. As the messengers left, the soldiers found ways to occupy themselves in the cove. They constructed shelters, sang songs, and repaired their gear. The valley's acoustics were perfect for singing, with echoes enhancing their melodies. Warner, confident in his singing skills, engaged in a playful banter about music and mathematics. Amidst the activities, they spotted Slade on the mountain, prompting a vigilant response from the troops.|"['1.

As they gazed, a flash of red emerged in the distance, smoke dispersed, and a bullet struck the ice close by. They swiftly scattered and observed the silver bushes from cover. Another shot wounded a man gathering wood. The hidden sharpshooter persisted. Colonel Winchester then directed a team to eliminate the bushes methodically, impressing Warner. The sharpshooter evaded them, causing injuries and creating a tense standoff. A plan was devised to outmaneuver the sharpshooter, involving blankets for traction on the ice.

Warner and his men heard the distant shots from Slade's rifle and the replies. Warner was confident that the colonel would keep Slade occupied, allowing them to make a flank movement. They advanced cautiously, using their bayonets as climbing tools on the icy slopes. As they reached a cluster of cedars, they took cover and observed Slade's movements. Reed noted Slade's intense desire to kill and his obsession with wiping them out. Warner decided they needed to take action and move closer to Slade. They carefully climbed the steep slope, using their bayonets for support. Finally, they reached a position where they could take aim at Slade.

Three young men felt a sense of destiny as John Watson headed north, bidding him a warm farewell. Amid a harsh winter, anticipation grew as preparations for a cavalry mission buzzed. The Union troops, led by the renowned Sheridan, were ready to confront Early's forces at Staunton. Despite the bitter cold, the troopers were eager for victory. As they set out with supplies and light equipment, the weather turned, causing muddy conditions. Yet, undeterred, the troops marched on, their spirits undampened.

The army planned to move the next day. Rosser, a Confederate general, aimed to burn bridges to slow Sheridan's advance. The Winchesters led the charge, racing to beat Rosser. As the two forces neared the Shenandoah, a Confederate cavalry tried to destroy the bridge. The Union army arrived, outnumbering the Confederates. A fierce battle ensued, with Union regiments swimming the river to flank the enemy. The Confederates were forced to retreat, leaving behind prisoners and wagons. The Union army marched on to Staunton, hoping to find Early. Winter turned to spring, bringing floods and muddy roads. Despite the challenges, Sheridan pressed on, hunting Early. They reached Staunton to find it deserted, with Early preparing to stand at Waynesborough. Sheridan's swift and precise attack overwhelmed Early, capturing most of his men and cannons. The Union forces continued to Charlottesville, where the town surrendered.

He returned to the general's side and witnessed the intense bombardment. Many guns in a wide half circle bombarded the slim Confederate lines with shells. The continuous blaze covered a long front, with huge clouds of smoke above. Harry thought the Union army would attack, but it didn't. Grant held back, avoiding unnecessary sacrifices after remembering Cold Harbor. As night fell, the cannons flashed and thundered, and Lee, with fewer than twenty thousand men, left Petersburg. It pained Harry to leave the city where they had resisted Grant for so long, but it was necessary. They couldn't endure the relentless fire. The march started in the darkness, hidden from the enemy by skirmishers. Crossing the Appomattox, they advanced on the Hickory road. General Lee, composed and steady, watched his troops pass by, inspiring them with his presence. The soldiers remained undaunted, cheered by Lee's leadership, despite the chaos behind them. The morning after Lee's retreat, the Winchester regiment entered Petersburg, surveying the aftermath. Richmond had also fallen, the capital of the Confederacy.

In the following days, Dick and his comrades rode into the desolate capital, Richmond, heavily garrisoned by the North. They refrained from showing any exultation as they gazed upon the blind doors and windows. Knowing Lee was marching along the Appomattox, they were determined not to let him escape. Sheridan's cavalry, with the Winchester regiment leading, pressed hard on the retreating army, taking prisoners and guns. Despite the valiant defense, the Southern army was starving and desperate. Dick felt pity for these ragged men, hoping for a swift end to Lee's suffering. As Lee's army dwindled, it fought fiercely against the relentless pursuit.

Dick noticed a young man on horseback not far behind Lee, his cousin Harry Kenton. Dick was overjoyed to see Harry still riding with Lee, almost justifying Dick's belief that Harry would survive the war. As the day turned to night, a scattered fire ended the skirmish, and the Southern leader retreated with Sheridan's cavalry relentlessly pursuing them. Despite a fierce counterattack by Lee, Sheridan and his men persisted, cutting off supplies and capturing Confederate guns. The end of the war seemed imminent, with Custer's bold raid sealing Lee's fate. On April 7th, near General Grant's headquarters, the exhausted troops witnessed the surrender negotiations.

"The Winchester men were on foot, their horses tied up nearby, and Dick, along with the colonel, Warner, and Pennington, were at the forefront, eagerly observing the ragged little army in front of them. A small group of soldiers emerged, led by two elderly men in worn but tidy uniforms, standing tall with no sign of defeat on their faces. Dick spotted St. Clair and Langdon among them, waving enthusiastically at them. St. Clair and Langdon walked over to meet them, exchanging greetings under an old oak tree. The initial awkwardness faded as they chatted, with St. Clair putting them at ease. The meeting ended with a trumpet call, and they parted ways, each returning to their own lines.

Later, as Dick stood on a hill, he saw Harry Kenton and Dalton waiting expectantly. The arrival of General Lee on his horse, Traveler, marked a significant moment. Despite the weariness from the retreat, Lee's proud demeanor was evident in his new uniform and sword.

General Grant, in a moment of victory, displayed great humanity by offering generous terms to the officers of the Army of Northern Virginia. They were to give their word not to fight against the United States until properly exchanged, with company and regimental commanders signing a similar agreement for their men. The defeated were allowed to keep their side arms, horses, and baggage, and return home. This act of compassion and magnanimity by Grant marked a significant moment in his legacy. The surrender at Appomattox Courthouse was a stark contrast to the harsh treatment often seen in European conflicts. Lee, acknowledging the kindness shown by Grant, accepted the terms. The two generals parted ways with mutual respect. The Civil War, with its immense toll, came to a close as both Union and Confederate soldiers shared food and camaraderie.|"['1.

"""We have raided a Yankee wagon train again,"" he said, ""and the looting is splendid. Arthur, I thought yesterday that I should never eat again. Food and I were such strangers that I believed we should never know each other, any more, or if knowing, we could never assimilate. And yet we seem to get on good terms at once.""

""Then this is the place to come,"" said Dick, putting before him food, which he strove to eat slowly, although the effort at restraint was manifestly great. Lieutenant Colonel St. Hilaire introduced him to the Union men, and then asked him what was the long black bag that he carried under his arm.

The group left the next day after a pleasant meeting, heading through the wilderness. Despite searching, Harry heard no news of his father and assumed he had gone to Kentucky. Sinister reports from Slade and Skelly changed their plans. They decided to stick together and head to Kentucky before returning south. As they rode through the mountains between Virginia and Kentucky, their group grew to thirty well-armed men. Looking down from a high point, Harry and Dick felt a mix of excitement and worry about returning home to Pendleton. While hunting, Harry encountered Skelly and another man who shot his horse and wounded him.

"The soldier had a serious wound in his left shoulder. The bullet had passed through, but it was still bleeding. He used strips of his clothing to bandage it and tried to walk back to camp. Feeling dizzy, he sat down and shouted for help. Weak and uncertain of his location, he feared dying alone. Suddenly, he heard a familiar voice singing in the distance. It was Sam Jarvis, a friend from the past. This gave the soldier renewed strength as he recognized the voice. Despite his weakness, he pushed forward towards the sound, but collapsed from exhaustion. With great effort, he rose again, leaning on a tree, and saw a valley and fields ahead. The voice singing ""Juanita"" guided him, providing hope and courage to continue."|"[""1.

It was an old song filled with sadness and longing, but Harry vividly recalled that warm, melodious voice. If he could find Sam Jarvis, he would get the help he needed from the happy valley where Jarvis resided. Gathering fresh courage, Harry left the edge of the forest and crossed a field where Jarvis was plowing. The singer, Jarvis, was content, guiding a sturdy bay horse as he worked the land. War had not touched his valley, and he sang joyously as life unfolded around him. As Harry approached the house, weakened by his journey, he found himself at the open doorway. Inside, an elderly woman recognized him as Henry Ware, the governor, and welcomed him warmly. As Harry regained consciousness, he found himself in a comfortable bed, cared for by Mrs. Simmons and Colonel Talbot, who recounted the events that led to Harry's rescue by their group of soldiers.|"['1.
