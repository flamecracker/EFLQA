The political party system is crucial for Democracy. It serves as the voice of the people and the mechanism of power. Parties have historically preceded democratic systems, as seen in England's division into Tory and Whig factions. In American history, the Patriots and Loyalists emerged from the Tory and Whig divide. The Patriots organized through committees and clubs, leading to the Revolution. After the Revolution, the failure of the Articles of Confederation highlighted the need for a stronger central government. This led to the formation of a federal nation, championed by Washington's call for a national government. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 saw the Federalists and Anti-Federalists debating the new Constitution. Washington's presidency aimed to unify the nation despite differing political ideologies. Jefferson's opposition to Federalism further showcased the evolving party dynamics in early American politics.|"[""1.

The Anti-Federalist name lost its relevance after the Government's establishment. Jefferson and his group didn't oppose a federal government but its centralization of power. They believed in popular control, evident in their name, Democratic-Republican. They aimed to limit federal power to State glorification, unlike the Federalists who sought to expand it. Jefferson aimed to maintain the Government's current form, emphasizing government by the people over representatives. Jefferson's exceptional organization skills united Anti-Federalists, small politicians, and artisans. The Jeffersonians, representing debtors and farmers, challenged Federalists on public spending, government ventures, and the Navy. Jefferson's election as President in 1800 marked a shift in American politics. The Jeffersonians embraced a liberal interpretation of the Constitution, while Federalists turned strict constructionists. This transition led to Jefferson's acquisition of the Louisiana territory. Jeffersonian democracy, supported by manufacturers and agriculturists, thrived post-England war. The Virginia Dynasty era under Madison and Monroe saw prosperity until the stormy 1824 election, transitioning from Jeffersonian to Jacksonian democracy.|"['1.

During the early 19th century, voting restrictions were lifted in many states, and new western states embraced universal suffrage. President Jackson, supported by a diverse group of followers, entered office amid a wave of democratic fervor. Jackson's presidency marked a shift in American politics, with his supporters advocating for a system where political allies were rewarded with government positions. Opposition to Jackson's policies led to the formation of the Whig party, led by Henry Clay, who opposed Jackson's expansion of executive power. Three key issues emerged: the fate of the United States Bank, the debate over protective tariffs, and disagreements on internal improvements. These issues, alongside personal rivalries, defined the political landscape of the time, ultimately shaping the course of American history.|"[""1.

"The birth of the Republican party in the mid-19th century marked a significant shift in American politics. Comprising former Whigs, anti-slavery Democrats, and members of smaller groups like the Know-Nothings and the Liberty party, the Republicans quickly gained traction, particularly in the North. This new party's emergence spurred the Democrats to take a firmer stance on the issue of slavery, leading to a split within their ranks in the 1860 election. The Southern Democrats backed Breckinridge, while the Northern faction supported Stephen A. Douglas. Amidst this turmoil, a third party, the Constitutional Union, nominated John Bell. Ultimately, Abraham Lincoln's leadership rallied anti-slavery forces under the Republican banner, securing victory. The aftermath of the Civil War saw the rise of the ""Solid South,"" perpetuating regional divides and altering the political landscape for years to come."|"['1.

"During the mid-1800s, the American or Know-Nothing party promoted the slogan ""America for Americans"" and made an impact in certain regions like New York and the Middle States between 1853 and 1856. The Free Soil party, advocating for slavery restrictions, nominated Martin Van Buren for president in 1848 and gained enough votes to challenge the Democratic candidate. The party's core belief was later embraced by the Republican party. Post-Civil War, third-party movements emerged twice due to currency issues, notably the Greenbacks from 1876-1884 and the Populists in the 1890s, both originating from the West. These movements, advocating for monetary reforms, eventually merged with established parties as the currency matter evolved into a crucial political concern. Another significant party, the Prohibitionists, has been naming national candidates since 1872. Despite their influence in local politics, the socialistic or labor party has not been a major player in national elections. The essence of a party lies not only in its principles but also in its organization, attracting individuals based on beliefs or opportunities for personal gain within the setup.

In the early days of American politics, the process of nominating presidential candidates was quite different from what we see today. Initially, candidates were chosen by members of Congress in a caucus system. However, this method faced criticism for being too exclusive and undemocratic. The turning point came in 1831 when the Anti-Masonic party held the first national nominating convention in Baltimore. This set a new precedent, and soon after, the Whigs and Democrats followed suit. These conventions became the standard way of selecting presidential candidates, with delegates from different states gathering to vote on nominees. The conventions also established rules that are still followed today, such as the requirement for a two-thirds majority for nomination in the Democratic party. This shift to national conventions marked a significant change in the political landscape of the United States.|['1.

In early American politics, the concept of conventions for nominating candidates was not new. As far back as 1789, a casual convention was held in Philadelphia to nominate Federalist candidates for the legislature. This practice spread to various Pennsylvania counties and other states, evolving from informal gatherings to structured conventions with appointed delegates. The shift from legislative caucuses to state nominating conventions began when the former lost credibility. Tammany Hall initiated one of the first state convention movements in 1812 in New York, fearing the nomination of DeWitt Clinton by the caucus. The evolution continued with the Democratic party's People's party holding the first state nominating convention in Utica in 1824. These conventions soon became the norm across the country, establishing a hierarchy of committees to conduct campaigns. The development of a national unity through a centralized committee system began to take shape, paving the way for the modern political machine.|"['1.

"In 1812, Clinton ran for President but lost to Madison. He later became Governor of New York, known for his conflicts with various factions. Clinton emphasized the importance of being decisive in politics. Martin Van Buren, a former follower of Clinton, mastered political strategies and formed the ""Albany Regency"" group. This group controlled state politics through patronage and strategic organization. Van Buren's machine was influential in state politics. The Virginia Dynasty, led by Jefferson, was not as organized but relied on influential individuals. The congressional caucus system faced challenges, leading to changes in how candidates were nominated.

The new Democracy did not eliminate the aristocratic power of the slaveholder. From Jackson's time to Buchanan's, this group gained influence within the party, showcasing how a small but determined faction can wield significant control in politics. The slavery issue exemplifies this, where a select few with economic interests held sway despite being a minority. This situation persisted due to savvy party leaders and the populace's reluctance to confront the real problem. Before the Civil War, party organization was integral to American politics. The war altered the country's landscape, providing more opportunities for politicians and reshaping political dynamics. The conflict transformed the nation, leading to significant changes in political activity and management. The aftermath saw a surge in political maneuvering, marked by radical reconstruction and the rise of new economic opportunities.|"['1.

The rise of prosperity in politics brought about significant changes in business organization during the post-war era. Previously, business was mainly run by individuals or small partnerships with limited capital. However, the rapid expansion of trade and the need for extensive capital led to the emergence of a new form of ownership - the corporation. While corporations existed before 1860, they were relatively small and based on special legislative charters. The advent of large corporations had a profound impact on politics, economics, and society. Private corporations engaged in political dealings for favorable charters and financial policies, while quasi-public corporations like railways relied heavily on government support. This intertwining of business and politics gave rise to party machines and political bosses, driven by gain and greed. General Grant, elected as President, surrounded himself with wealthy businessmen in his Cabinet, reflecting the era's focus on business success over principles.|['1.

During the 1870s, President Grant's administration faced scandals like the Whiskey Ring and the War Department corruption. Grant's private secretary, Babcock, faced accusations of involvement in defrauding the government, but the President defended him. The exposure of the Whiskey Ring led to further scandals, including Secretary of War Belknap's impeachment for corruption. Despite his resignation, Belknap's guilt was evident. The era was marked by rampant corruption in state and city governments, with judges and officials facing impeachment for malpractice. Grant's loyalty to his associates, despite their wrongdoings, reflected the era's ethical decline.

During the period between 1860 and 1890, there was a significant rise in the number of cities with a population of 8000 or more inhabitants. This urban growth was a result of the booming commerce and industry following the war. By 1890, the percentage of people living in cities had increased to over 30%, and by 1910, it reached 46.3%. The rapid urbanization led to the establishment of large cities with populations exceeding half a million and a surge in smaller cities. This growth created opportunities for political manipulation in urban areas, where local power sources were crucial for the functioning of the national political machine. The American city's governmental structure was influenced by the English system, with mayors and councils overseeing local affairs. However, the power dynamics shifted as legislatures gained the authority to grant and modify city charters, impacting the autonomy of city governments.|"['1.

In early American towns like New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, and Charleston in 1790, governing was straightforward due to small populations and simple needs. As these towns grew into cities, demands for services like lighting, street cleaning, fire protection, and public education arose. The mayor and council initially managed these tasks efficiently. However, with rapid urbanization, cities outgrew their old systems, leading to conflicts between citizens seeking accountability and politicians avoiding it. The focus shifted between empowering city councils, mayors, or governing boards. Each model had its challenges, with some allowing political manipulation and favoritism. The struggle for effective municipal governance persisted until the Galveston plan of commission government in 1901 aimed to address these issues by centralizing power and accountability.|['1.

In the past, laws sometimes required appointive boards to have members from different political parties or with varying political opinions on state and national matters. The aim was to remove political bias from these boards. However, this did not hinder the influence of political bosses. Despite differences in national opinions, board members often aligned with local appointing authorities. For example, in 1898, the Democratic mayor of New York removed two Republican police commissioners and replaced them with Republicans of his choosing. This bipartizan approach fit into the dual-party system of many cities, where county and city offices were divided between parties to share the benefits. Alongside these governance methods, cities saw increased spending on infrastructure, schools, and public services, providing opportunities for political gain. Public service corporations also played a significant role, offering favors to politicians in exchange for influence over regulations and decisions. The system of committees and conventions tied to national parties allowed politicians to advance their agendas under the guise of party politics, while the electorate, comprising both rural migrants and foreign immigrants unfamiliar with American democracy, often remained passive, allowing politicians to wield power unchecked.|['1.

"The hasty methods of granting citizenship became apparent under the new law of 1906. Many voters believed they were citizens, only to discover their papers were just declarations of intent. Some had lost these papers and couldn't identify the courts that issued them. Others realized the courts that naturalized them lacked jurisdiction. The city blocks provided convenient lodging for ""floaters"" during elections, boosting downtown ward populations. The boss exploited the city's social dynamics, corrupting individuals in the crowd. Before the Revolutionary War, societies like the ""Sons of Liberty"" and ""Sons of St. Tammany"" supported Independence. In New York, the ""Tammany Society"" attracted small shopkeepers and mechanics, fostering anti-British sentiments.

"In history, Tammany Hall, led by Matthew L. Davis under Aaron Burr's guidance, employed various corrupt tactics to secure power. Burr manipulated the city's voting system, creating fake freeholders for polling. Instances of corruption included officials acquiring city land without payment and embezzling funds. Tammany members defrauded banks and insurance companies of over $2,000,000. Samuel Swartwout, a Tammany leader, embezzled over $1,222,700. The council known as ""The Forty Thieves"" saw William M. Tweed's rise, with revelations of money spent on railroad grants. These scandals led to city charter amendments and the election of a reform council.

During the Civil War, while citizens were focused on national issues, reform efforts in the city fluctuated. In 1863, a reform candidate became mayor, but Tammany regained power in 1865 with John T. Hoffman. Hoffman, though capable and charismatic, was easily influenced. Tammany aimed to make him Governor and even eyed him for the presidency. William M. Tweed, a chairmaker turned political boss, was a key figure. He controlled Tammany through strong-arm tactics, manipulating nominations and city finances. The infamous Ring, comprising Tweed, Connolly, and Sweeny, held sway over New York City. Despite suspicions, the Ring's influence extended to the Governor, legislature, and even national politics. Their control over finances and partnerships with influential figures kept dissent at bay.|['1.

In the 1800s, a corrupt group known as the Ring controlled New York City. They demanded kickbacks from anyone doing business with the city, inflating bills by up to 85%. For example, a man was forced to increase his $5000 claim to $55,000, with the Ring pocketing the extra $50,000. Projects like the Court House ballooned in cost, with absurd expenses like $179,729.60 for just forty chairs and three tables. Bribery was rampant, with millions spent to buy votes and secure favors. The Ring even tried to pass a bill allowing a railway company they owned to take over city streets tax-free. Newspapers were paid handsomely to stay silent. The scale of corruption was so outrageous that a newspaper jokingly suggested erecting a statue to honor the Ring's leader.|"['1.

"A different kind of tribute to his talent for taking the people's money was waiting for this generous pirate. Showy displays were the public signs of these city thefts. Tweed moved into a grand mansion on Fifth Avenue and hosted an extravagant wedding for his daughter, where she received gifts worth $100,000, including a wedding dress that cost $5000. He erected a lavish country estate in Greenwich with stables made of fine mahogany. Sweeny associated with Jim Fiske of the Erie, known as the Tweed of Wall Street, who flaunted loud checkered outfits and lived with his group of women in his Opera House on Eighth Avenue. Some observant citizens noticed these activities and suspected the city was being robbed, but they lacked evidence. However, two groups took action without proof—Thomas Nast, a talented cartoonist for Harper's Weekly, and the New York Times. Nast's sharp cartoons resonated with people of all classes, even Tweed's followers. The powerful editorials by Louis L. Jennings in the Times reached a discerning audience. In a notable editorial on February 24, 1871, before the scandal broke, Jennings expressed concerns about the corruption in the city. Ultimately, evidence emerged, largely from within.

Tweed, a once-powerful figure, faced legal troubles for embezzlement. Despite being convicted and sentenced to prison, he managed to escape on a technicality. However, he was eventually captured and sent back to New York, where he died in jail. The stolen amount was estimated to be between $45-50 million. Tammany, the corrupt political organization Tweed was associated with, faced public outrage. Yet, in 1874, Tammany regained power under John Kelly, who brought about some reforms. Kelly's leadership attracted prominent figures, signaling a shift towards integrity within the organization. After Kelly's death, Richard Croker, known for his political cunning and moral shortcomings, took over as boss.

In 1892, Tammany's victory in New York led to blatant corruption, awakening citizens once more. The Fassett Committee's prior investigation had exposed Tammany's deep influence in city administration. Following this, a new committee was formed, led by Clarence Lexow and John W. Goff, focusing on the Police Department. Shocking revelations emerged, showcasing police involvement in election fraud and the monetization of vice and crime under police protection. The committee estimated an annual plunder of over $7,000,000 from various illicit sources. Despite these findings, Tammany's power persisted, with Boss Croker's influence evident in city affairs. However, in 1894, a reform government led by Mayor William L. Strong brought about positive changes, including efficient city management and a clean-up initiative. Yet, corruption resurfaced with the rise of Tammany's control over Greater New York. The Mazet Committee's investigation in 1899 exposed further corruption, including the Ice Trust scandal involving city officials. Mayor Robert A. Van Wyck escaped removal due to insufficient evidence. Boss Croker's testimony revealed the extent of Tammany's hold on city politics and business, emphasizing self-interest above all else.|"[""1.

Shortly after Croker retired to his Irish estate, Charles Murphy took over as the current leader. However, the increasing awareness of voters makes Murphy's role more challenging than his predecessors'. The machine's nature likely remained unchanged throughout its history. Tweed and Croker were products of the system, symbolizing organized corruption. In 1913, Independent Democrats, Republicans, and Progressives united to elect John Purroy Mitchel as mayor. Mitchel's administration set a new standard for clean governance. Despite this, Tammany Hall outmaneuvered Mitchel in his 1917 reelection bid. Tammany's resilience stems from its efficient organization, rooted in Burr's 1800 victory. The Democratic-Republican General Committee, with over 9000 members, is the core of Tammany Hall's structure. The executive committee, comprising district leaders, selects candidates and manages campaigns. The district leader plays a crucial role, representing their district and serving on the executive committee. The boss must navigate internal politics to maintain power. After women gained the right to vote in 1917, they became eligible for committee roles within Tammany Hall.|"['1.

Each of the twenty-three assembly districts is divided into smaller election districts with around 400 voters. Each district has a precinct captain who knows every voter and their affairs. There are headquarters and a club house in every assembly district where voters can socialize and relax. This organization is always active, which is crucial to its strength. Tammany is attentive to the poor and humble, providing assistance and guidance. New immigrants are welcomed, given work, food, or shelter, and encouraged to become citizens who support Tammany. Tammany's machinery allows for efficient canvassing. The organization historically used fraud at the polls to influence elections. While new laws have curbed these practices, Tammany continues to adapt to changing times while maintaining its internal discipline.|"['1.

In Philadelphia, the citizens discovered that their city had fallen under the control of a small group known as the Gas Ring. This powerful oligarchy manipulated city departments, including the police force, to control elections and extort money from the city's workers and businesses. The Gas Ring's corruption led to poor public services, unsafe conditions, and financial mismanagement. In 1883, the citizens petitioned for a new charter to reform the government, leading to the Bullitt Law of 1887, which centralized power in the mayor's office. However, the Gas Ring resorted to fraudulent tactics like registering deceased individuals and animals to maintain their grip on the city.

During Mayor Ashbridge's term, corruption peaked, with the mayor himself involved in the Ring. The Philadelphia Ring's influence fluctuated, but St. Louis gained home rule in 1875.

During a period of corruption in the city, many individuals were indicted for engaging in illegal activities. The evidence revealed that influential businessmen were buying and selling contracts and franchises from legislators. Edward R. Butler, a prominent figure, controlled the political landscape through manipulation and bribery. Similarly, in Cincinnati, George B. Cox ruled the city for three decades, engaging in corrupt practices with other political figures. The city experienced riots due to unjust court rulings, leading to a halt in corrupt activities. However, the exchange of political influence for personal gain continued. Cox's ability to secure a Republican majority in elections through manipulation solidified his power. These instances highlight the detrimental impact of corruption on public affairs and the importance of transparency and ethical governance.|"['1.

In the early 1900s, Cox, a quiet and modest man, controlled the city's political machine from a small room above a saloon. Despite his unassuming demeanor, he wielded power behind the scenes, never seeking the limelight or amassing great wealth. However, as calls for political reform grew louder, Cox resorted to importing dubious voters to maintain his influence. Eventually, his tactics were exposed, leading to widespread scrutiny. Even a prominent figure, William H. Taft, urged the Republicans to distance themselves from Cox. Although reformers managed to elect a new mayor, Cox maintained his grip on the county and city council until his death in 1916. San Francisco's political history has been tumultuous, marked by corruption and inefficiency. The city's governance faced challenges, leading to the formation of vigilance committees and calls for charter reforms to combat mismanagement and improve public services.|"[""1.

In 1900, citizens of San Francisco successfully implemented a new charter with significant changes. The mayor took on executive responsibilities supported by a robust civil service system. Plans were set for municipal ownership of public services, and the initiative and referendum were introduced for public projects. The legislative power was vested in a board of eighteen supervisors elected citywide. However, the optimism was short-lived as corruption soon seeped in. The city's administration was accused of engaging in corrupt practices, with reports of illegal contracts and favors exchanged with criminals and the underworld. The Grand Jury highlighted widespread corruption, but lacked concrete evidence for indictments. The situation worsened with universal graft, where officials engaged in various corrupt practices to profit illegally. The mayor was controlled by a manipulative lawyer, Abe Ruef, who orchestrated corrupt deals behind the scenes. After a persistent effort by private citizens, a Grand Jury investigation led to multiple indictments, including Ruef's conviction and the exposure of corrupt practices within the city's administration.|"['1.

In 1900, a new primary law allowed Ames, a former Democrat turned Republican, to run for office again with the support of his followers. Ames was known for seeking popularity over discipline, attracting the poor and criminals to his cause by championing their interests. As mayor of Minneapolis, he abused his power by appointing his weak brother as Chief of Police, leading to corruption in the police force. Criminals flocked to Minneapolis to take advantage of the lax law enforcement, engaging in various illegal activities. Eventually, a courageous Grand Jury exposed the corruption, leading to the indictment and conviction of Ames's brother and accomplices. Mayor Ames fled to Indiana to evade justice.|"[""1.

The City Council President, a skilled businessman with knowledge, diplomacy, and honesty, briefly took on the role of mayor for four months, enough time to restore the city's political stability. These instances highlight how cities operate politically. It's important to note that many American cities, not just the well-known ones, have faced control by a small group of politicians at some point. This control isn't always corrupt but often leads to ineffective governance. Fortunately, signs show that the conditions fostering these issues are fading. A reform period began around 1890, sparking interest in municipal governance studies. Colleges started offering courses on the topic, and the public became more engaged in local politics. By 1900, a new era emerged, focusing on enlightened administration and reshaping city governments. The aim was to centralize power and attract capable individuals to municipal roles. This shift has led to various positive changes, including a decline in the influence of national parties in local politics, the rise of home rule, and reforms in taxation and budgeting systems. Various organizations have also emerged to support officials and promote civic engagement. These transformations have elevated the status of municipal service, emphasizing the importance and dignity of working for the city.|['1.

When the American people established their first state constitutions, they were deeply wary of giving too much power to the executive branch due to their negative experiences with King George. As a result, they intentionally limited the authority of the executive within their own governments and elevated the legislative branch to a position of supreme legal power. In the original states, the legislature held significant influence, appointing judicial and administrative officers, overseeing local governments, and even appointing delegates to the Continental Congress. Over time, however, party politics began to dominate state legislatures, leading to the rise of legislative caucuses and the consolidation of party power. This shift resulted in the legislature becoming the primary arm of state government, with the ability to pass laws and appoint key officials. However, as party control increased, the quality of legislators diminished, leading to a decline in public trust. To address these issues, various measures like the initiative, referendum, and recall were introduced to limit the legislature's powers and increase accountability to the people. The decline of legislative authority began around 1835 when new state constitutions started to curtail its powers, reflecting a growing lack of confidence in legislators. The proliferation of complex state constitutions in modern times underscores the erosion of legislative power and the public's skepticism towards elected representatives. Efforts to curb corruption and undue influence in state legislatures have been made through mechanisms like the initiative and referendum, aiming to empower citizens and reduce the impact of special interests on legislative decision-making.|"['1.

"After the Civil War, New York City became the nation's business hub. To protect their interests, businesses stationed representatives in Albany to influence bills. Over time, the number of lobbyists decreased as corporate interests became more efficient. Instead of dealing with lawmakers individually, they negotiated with party bosses for favorable legislation. This system relied on a machine controlling the legislature. Both parties in New York were influenced by machines like ""Tom"" Platt for the Republicans and Tammany for the Democrats. The revelation of legislative bargaining in the insurance investigation of 1905 showed how companies like the New York Life Insurance were involved in campaign funding. Governor William Sulzer's impeachment in 1913 highlighted the power of invisible government and the close ties between the legislature and political machines."|"['1.

"The Tammany party, with a strong majority in both houses, did not support the changed Governor Sulzer. When an ineffective primary law was presented to him for approval, he vetoed it. The Governor reconvened the legislature for an extra session to pass a proper primary law. Threats from the machine turned into action when the Assembly impeached the Governor on various charges, some based on facts and others trivial. The impeachment was not just of the Governor but of the state's government. The story of Simon Cameron, known as ""the Great Winnebago,"" illustrates how he used political power for personal gain.

During the Civil War, Matthew S. Quay held various public offices, including being Governor Curtin's private secretary. He later became a key figure in Pennsylvania politics, using state funds for personal gain. Despite facing indictment, Quay avoided trial due to the statute of limitations. His influence extended to Pittsburgh, where he controlled political appointments. The system of political machines, like Quay's, was not unique to Pennsylvania but a widespread issue in American politics. The election process for the President and Vice-President was initially designed to avoid partisanship but evolved into a competitive, partisan affair. The Electoral College, once independent, now largely reflects party affiliations.

"The Constitution allows the States' legislatures to choose how electors are selected. Initially, legislatures picked them, later the people did, sometimes at large, but mostly by districts, now the common practice. Direct nominations led to movements to end the Electoral College for a direct presidential vote. The President holds immense power, being Commander-in-Chief, overseeing international relations, civil administration, and key departments. He appoints officials, influences legislation, and wields a strong veto. The Senate ratifies his appointments and treaties, while the House controls money bills. Originally, Senators were chosen by state legislatures, but the 17th amendment (1913) enabled direct senatorial elections.

"During the 19th century in the United States, the President's role within his political party was complex. While the President was nominally the party head, in reality, this was not always the case. The extent of the President's influence depended on various factors such as their personality, relationship with Congress and the public, and the current circumstances. For instance, during Ulysses S. Grant's presidency, a powerful federal machine controlled by key Congress members held significant sway over government appointments and legislation. This system, known as the ""Federal Crowd,"" comprised federal office-holders appointed through political favoritism. However, by 1876, a movement advocating for civil service reform gained momentum. President Rutherford B. Hayes, who took office in 1877, pledged to enact thorough reform, distancing himself from the patronage system that had characterized previous administrations.

In 1883, the Civil Service Act was passed, reducing the President's appointments by about 14,000. Since then, nearly every President, especially towards the end of their term, has increased the number of federal offices filled by examination. President Cleveland and President Roosevelt made significant additions during their terms. President Taft, before leaving office, placed many positions in the classified service. Despite this, the President's appointing power remains a key aspect of their connection with the political system. The House of Representatives, elected every two years, controls the budget, influencing executive decisions. Speaker Reed, in 1890, strengthened the Speakership by ensuring a quorum for business. The Rules Committee, led by the Speaker, set debate limits and determined the fate of bills. The Speaker's role became crucial in driving party discipline and centralized authority. Speaker Cannon's era marked the peak of the Speaker's power, with Republicans holding a large majority in the House.|"[""1.

"The revolt against party regularity arose due to the misuse of power by a small group within the organization. The insurgents, supported by Democrats, made changes to the House rules in 1910 to limit the Speaker's authority. The Senate, a powerful entity in the political hierarchy, shares lawmaking and appointment responsibilities with the House and the President. Over time, the Senate has faced scrutiny for its ties to big corporations, leading to public distrust. Revelations of close relationships between senators and big businesses, like the Standard Oil Company, sparked public outrage.

"In the early 1900s, a revolt against the dominant political party, known as ""Cannonism,"" unfolded in both the House and the Senate. Around 1909, during the vote on the Aldrich tariff bill, approximately ten Republican senators rebelled against the party line. This rebellion gained momentum, leading to the formation of the National Progressive party in 1912, with Theodore Roosevelt as the presidential candidate and Hiram Johnson as the vice-presidential candidate. While many Progressives returned to the Republican party by 1916, the division persisted, ultimately resulting in Woodrow Wilson's reelection as a Democrat. Over time, election practices evolved from simple handwritten or printed ballots to more organized party-printed ballots with different colors and textures. Eventually, states mandated uniform white ballots to ensure fairness and prevent voter manipulation, culminating in the adoption of the Australian ballot system in some states like Massachusetts, which allowed voters to make informed and independent choices in the privacy of a booth."|['1.

In 1889, Indiana adopted a new voting system similar to the Australian ballot. Parties were represented by columns on the ballot instead of individual offices. Each party had a column with its name and symbol for illiterate voters to recognize and vote easily. A circle under each symbol allowed voters to cast a straight vote. Over the following years, many other states adopted this system. The control of election procedures shifted to state officials, ensuring fair elections. The parties lost control over ballot preparation and election day activities. Strict laws regulated all election processes, from ballot distribution to counting and reporting results. The atmosphere at polling places transformed from chaotic to orderly, ensuring a calm voting experience. States like Massachusetts also passed anti-lobby laws to regulate the influence of special interests in legislative matters.|"['1.

The law required the Secretary of the Commonwealth to report those who didn't follow the act for prosecution. Sixty-seven such offenders were reported in the first year, but the Grand Jury didn't charge them. The number of disobedient people has since decreased. This trend was not unique to Massachusetts. Other states also passed strict anti-lobby laws, leading to a decline in unsavory practices in state Capitols. With the decline of professional lobbyists, volunteer lobbyists took their place. Bills are now discussed in public committee hearings, replacing secrecy with transparency in legislative processes. Some states have introduced the initiative and referendum for ordinary legislation, allowing a small percentage of voters to propose and decide on laws. This move towards simplified government aims to hold elected officials more accountable and streamline the legislative process.|"[""1.

In the past, the State didn't pay much attention to political parties, viewing them as groups of citizens with similar beliefs. However, with the Australian ballot, the State officially recognized parties by including their nominees on the ballot. This prevented manipulation by individuals from different parties cooperating to secure nominations. To regulate this, Massachusetts defined a party as a group that received a certain percentage of votes in the previous election. Other states, like New York, set a specific number of voters required to form a party. The State also determined who could join a party and participate in its activities to prevent manipulation. For example, an Oregon statute protects parties from interference by non-members during elections. Various methods exist for citizens to join a party, like declaring party allegiance during primaries. In New York, voters enroll with a party when registering for elections, indicating their support for the party's principles and nominees.|"[""1.

Wisconsin, known for its innovative approach, introduced a system to ensure voter secrecy during primaries. Voters receive a ballot with all party nominations, each separated by perforations. They tear out their chosen party ticket, mark it, and place it in the ballot box, discarding the others. The State Central Committee plays a crucial role in democratizing the party structure. Illinois allows voters in each congressional district to select committee members, preventing boss influence. Iowa follows a similar district-based selection process in a state convention. In Wisconsin, candidates for state offices elect a central committee, ensuring representation from each congressional district. Different states have varying methods to control party committees, impacting the party platform's formulation. Some states allow candidates to write their platforms, while others involve committees or hold state meetings to decide.|['1.

"The convention system was once widely used for nominating candidates for office but faced issues due to manipulation and inefficiency when selecting multiple candidates. In the United States, the method persisted for presidential nominations due to its adaptability to the nation's vast geography and the limited nominations of a President and Vice-President. However, in state and county conventions, where numerous candidates were nominated, the system often led to unethical practices and dissatisfaction among voters. In response to these challenges, the Republican voters of Crawford County, Pennsylvania, adopted a resolution in 1860 advocating for direct nominations by the people to ensure candidates truly represented the voters' wishes. This approach, known as the ""Crawford County plan,"" gained traction in various states, leading to the gradual adoption of primary elections to address the flaws in the nominating process."|"['1.

The State is facing a dilemma over campaign expenses, considering taking on some costs previously handled by political parties. The financial burden of elections, especially primary and general ones, is significant. Some Western States provide voters with a campaign pamphlet containing candidate photos, bios, and principles. This marks government interference in party autonomy. New York's election laws span 330 pages. American parties are looking to European models like labor and social democratic parties, known for year-round activity, member dues, and permanent officials. Governor Whitman suggested paying a party manager to ensure full dedication, a concept met with mixed reviews. Flexibility is crucial for a party system serving a growing democracy. Independent voters often sway election outcomes, disliking both state-imposed party rules and boss control. In cities, citizens' tickets and fusion movements represent independent efforts for political change.|"['1.

In 1894, the New York Committee of Seventy was formed after Dr. Parkhurst exposed police corruption. Thirty-three citizens called for a non-partisan meeting, appointing a committee of seventy to address the issues. The committee worked with other anti-Tammany groups, adopted a platform, and nominated a ticket that was supported by various organizations and won the election. In Chicago, the Municipal Voters' League scrutinizes candidates, aiming to influence party nominations through public pressure. Fusion movements, like Mayor Mitchel's election in 1913, unite against corrupt rule. Early U.S. administrations faced challenges in appointing officials, with Washington emphasizing fitness for duty. Jefferson, after his election, aimed to consolidate power by removing Federalist officials and making strategic appointments. His actions led to the consolidation of political parties and quelled opposition.|"['1.

During the era of the Jeffersonian Republicans, important changes were proposed in Congress. Nathaniel Macon suggested an amendment in 1811 stating that no member of Congress could hold a government job until after their term. Josiah Quincy proposed a rule to prevent the relatives of senators or representatives from getting appointments. Nepotism, favoring family in job appointments, was a big issue. In 1820, the Four Years' Act limited federal appointments to four years to prevent inefficiency and corruption. Jackson later continued these reforms, believing that public office should serve the people, not personal gain. The debate over these changes showed how politics influenced government appointments, leading to a system where winning parties could replace officials with their supporters. Jackson's efforts reduced the number of removed officials, focusing on loyalty to his Democratic ideals.|"[""1.

Jackson may not have started the spoils system, but he certainly gave it purpose. The system aimed to rid the nation of bureaucratic corruption. Van Buren, Jackson's successor, refined the system to new heights. He demanded that all appointees show loyalty to the party. The Whigs fought against this, but their own President, Harrison, found himself overwhelmed by office-seekers. The practice continued through various presidencies until Lincoln, who navigated the challenges of a divided party and a looming civil war. Lincoln recognized the need for reform in the patronage system. Post-Civil War, there was a push for change. Efforts for civil service efficiency began in the 1850s but faced opposition until the Civil Service Act of 1883 was finally passed after a long battle between Presidents and Congress.|['Question 1: Who refined the spoils system to new heights?\nA) Jackson\nB) Harrison\nC) Lincoln\nD) Van Buren\nE) Washington', 'Question 2: What did Van Buren demand from all appointees?\nA) Experience\nB) Loyalty to the party\nC) Wealth\nD) Education\nE) Military service', 'Question 3: Who found themselves overwhelmed by office-seekers despite the Whigs fighting against the spoils system?\nA) Jackson\nB) Lincoln\nC) Van Buren\nD) Washington\nE) Harrison', 'Question 4: Who recognized the need for reform in the patronage system?\nA) Jackson\nB) Harrison\nC) Lincoln\nD) Van Buren\nE) Washington', 'Question 5: When did efforts for civil service efficiency begin facing opposition until the Civil Service Act of 1883?\nA) 1700s\nB) 1800s\nC) 1900s\nD) 2000s\nE) 1600s', 'Question 6: Who navigated the challenges of a divided party and a looming civil war?\nA) Jackson\nB) Harrison\nC) Lincoln\nD) Van Buren\nE) Washington']|['D) Van Buren', 'B) Loyalty to the party', 'E) Harrison', 'C) Lincoln', 'B) 1800s', 'C) Lincoln']
