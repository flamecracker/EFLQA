Dear students, the best way to learn about insects is by observing them closely. Books are helpful, but watching insects in action teaches you even more. If you want to study them up close, gently capture them under a clear container. Remember to provide food and a drop of water daily. Ensure they have air by sliding a card under the container's rim. If the insects won't eat or you're unsure what to feed them, it's best to release them after a day or two. Insects have fascinating facets, usually six-sided, visible under a microscope. Dragonflies, with their insatiable appetite, prey on various insects, even large butterflies. Birds and insects may catch butterflies, leaving their wings behind. Dragonflies lay eggs in water, showing their wisdom as mothers. Larvae live underwater, feeding and growing for months before a remarkable transformation. Fish love to eat Mayflies, whose gills help them absorb oxygen from the water. Insects, on the other hand, have air tubes that help them breathe.|"['1.

May flies are fascinating creatures that undergo a remarkable transformation from larvae to delicate insects with wings. After spending time in the water as larvae, they emerge as perfect winged May flies. However, even then, they are not quite done with infancy. They still have a delicate skin wrapped around them that they need to shed. To do this, they fly to a bush near the water and wait until the skin splits and comes off, leaving them free to fly. Trout benefit from this emergence as the May flies provide them with a plentiful food source, making them fat and good-flavored. Additionally, birds like swallows enjoy a feast when the May flies come out, creating a lively ecosystem around streams. It's truly remarkable how these creatures transition from aquatic larvae to graceful airborne insects in such a short span of time.|['1.

The silver fish is a slippery creature with scales that make it hard to catch and hold. It darts around like a silver dart and loves to eat starch, causing damage to wallpapers and book-bindings. Even though it's called a fish moth, it's not a moth at all. It's also known as a bristle-tail due to the bristle-like parts at the end of its body. In warm places, like the Southern United States, they thrive, while in colder regions, they struggle to survive. Cockroaches, including the American cockroach, are fast and hard to catch, with some species living in the woods. Mantes, or praying mantises, are known for their unique posture with uplifted arms, waiting to catch unsuspecting insects. Grasshoppers can swarm and devastate crops, causing concern for farmers. The mantis uses its strong legs to trap insects in a merciless grip.|['1.

"The grasshopper's wings work like a roof, tightly overlapping to cover the inner wings. Some grasshoppers even have eardrums on their front legs to hear sounds. They can make music by rubbing parts of their wing covers together. Grasshoppers communicate through chirping, shrilling, and buzzing sounds. By listening carefully, you can distinguish between different insects just like identifying birds by their songs. Each ring in the insect's abdomen consists of four pieces. Learning about insects, like grasshoppers, can be as interesting as learning about other things like ""Mississippi"" or ""rhinoceros."" Grasshoppers go through stages of growth, starting as wingless katydids and developing into fully grown insects. Grasshoppers have mouth parts for biting but are harmless to humans. There are different types of Orthoptera insects, each with unique characteristics like running, grasping, walking, and jumping."|"['1.

May is curious about how insects manage to carry a layer of air under the water. If you observe closely with a magnifying glass, May, you'll notice that insects have fine hairs that trap air. Just like the jewel weed leaf that shimmers when submerged, these hairs retain air. Many leaves shine underwater due to these fine hairs that prevent air from escaping. Bugs also use hairs to hold air, similar to leaves. Grasshoppers and bees visibly breathe as their abdomens move in and out to facilitate air exchange. While some insects need minimal air, others like beetles release foul-smelling liquid when disturbed. Certain animals, like bears and insects, hibernate during winter. Insects like water boatmen have unique features, such as rudimentary wings and laying eggs in crevices.|['1.

Insects, like the tiny book lice found in old books, have fascinating ways of communicating. They can release pleasant odors to attract mates over long distances. Did you know that your nose can detect incredibly small amounts, like 1/2,760,000,000 of a grain of a smelly substance? Grasshoppers have small ocelli on their heads, possibly remnants from their worm ancestors. Over generations, unused organs may disappear. For example, cicadas use sharp, tube-like mouths to suck juice from leaves and twigs. These creatures are full of surprises, revealing the wonders of nature and evolution.|"['1.

May, this small shell is made of chitin, a durable substance that resists fire but succumbs to earth's moisture and acids over time. Cicada shells, grasshopper skins, and cricket moults, all chitinous, return to the earth eventually. I once encountered a deafening swarm of cicadas in North Carolina, sounding like a rushing torrent. The froth on plants may protect against some foes but not wasps that prey on the insects within. Destructive insects like the rose-leaf hopper and tree hoppers damage crops. Aphids secrete honeydew, attracting ants that protect them. Some insects, like scale bugs, produce shellac used in varnishes. Insect infestations often require spraying plants to control.|['1.

There are scale bugs that produce wax used in candles and commerce. China wax, secreted by a Chinese scale bug, is of fine quality for candle-making. Birds benefit farmers by eating insects harmful to crops. The Audubon Society promotes bird conservation. The dobson insect has a long larval stage under stones in water, with anchors at its body's tip. It undergoes a unique, motionless transformation. The male dobson has dangerous jaws, while the female is the real biter. The corydalus insect undergoes a pupa stage, transforming into the adult form. Insects with incomplete metamorphosis have nymphs, like the grasshopper. Corydalus lays many eggs near water, with larvae growing into big-horned adults.|"['1.
