My initial days at sea were tough, and I missed my home dearly. I fell sick, as Tom Lokins described, but gradually I recovered and started enjoying the fresh sea air and the rolling waves. I often sat on the bowsprit, gazing at the vast ocean and the clouds above, contemplating the new chapter in my life. Memories of my mother's advice echoed in my mind, urging me to trust in the Lord. The sailors, though rough, were good-hearted, and we shared many laughs and pranks. Crossing the equator marked by Neptune's playful visit, where we were all initiated with tar and grease. As we reached the fishing grounds, excitement filled the air, and a calm night stirred eerie tales among the crew. Amidst a ghost story, a mishap led to chaos, but the luminous sea calmed my nerves, shimmering like a belt of blue flames in the dark waters.|"[""1.

Tom had often noticed a light in the sea but never bothered to learn about it. Luckily, the captain arrived and explained that the light came from tiny, nearly invisible sea creatures. These creatures shine brightly when disturbed by waves or ships. The captain shared that sometimes a calm sea hides an approaching storm, emphasizing the importance of being prepared. The doctor once explained a barometer to Tom, a device that predicts weather changes by measuring air pressure. Suddenly, a storm hit the ship, causing chaos and forcing the crew to secure the sails. The violent storm made the ship tilt dangerously and the sea churned with fury.|"['1.

"The captain shouted, ""Take in the topsails!"" but the roaring storm drowned his voice. The sails were torn to ribbons, leaving only the storm-trysail. Attempting to face the storm failed, forcing the ship to scud under bare poles. Despite the fierce gale, the captain skillfully steered the ship, saving it from disaster. The crew remained calm and obedient, knowing their lives depended on the captain's expertise. The storm eventually subsided, and the crew repaired the damage under the comforting rays of the sun.

"Three boats quickly launched into the water, equipped with tubs, harpoons, and oars, as the men rowed away with enthusiasm. In the rush of excitement, a strong rower managed to join one of the boats. From the crow's-nest came the cry, ""There she blows!"" signaling the presence of whales nearby. The crew found themselves in the midst of a group of whales. The captain directed the rowers towards a massive whale, known as a ""hundred-barrel whale"" for its oil yield.

"The command was given to ""hold the line."" Our boat swiftly cut through the blue water, leaving a trail of white foam behind. I feared we would be pulled under, but the line was loosened when the strain became too much. Finally, the fish tired, and Tom reeled in the slack line. Suddenly, the fish surfaced near us.

Our first mate shared an incredible tale of a daring escape in the Greenland Sea Fishery. A whale was struck, and as they rowed hard to reach it again, the harpooner swiftly pierced the blubber. The whale, in agony, raised its tail high, about to strike. The harpooner's quick dive into the water saved his life as the whale's flukes sliced the boat in two. Thankfully, all were rescued. The crew then worked swiftly to hoist the whale aboard. The blubber, fins, and jaw were carefully extracted. The whale's unique mouth, filled with whalebone, filters its food of small sea creatures. The blubber was meticulously cut and stored, with the captain estimating a hefty profit from the fat whale.|"[""1.

During the voyage, my messmate, Tom Lokins, often talked about the sea-birds that accompany whalers. I was amazed when I saw an enormous albatross, the largest flying bird, glide towards us. Soon, other birds like gonies, stinkards, and petrels joined, feeding greedily on the whale's carcass. Sharks also appeared, not just scavenging but boldly biting into the whale. These sharks, with rows of sharp teeth, were fearless. Tom, determined to retaliate against a shark, called for help to catch it. Even after cutting its tail and removing its entrails, the shark continued to thrash about the deck. Witnessing this struggle, I realized the resilience of these creatures. Eventually, after the whale was stripped of its blubber, it was released into the sea, sinking to the delight of the sharks and the disappointment of the smaller birds.|"['1.

No one who has not heard that cry can understand the dreadful feelings that arise in the human heart from it. My heart seemed to leap into my mouth and almost choke me at first. Then a terrible fear shot through me, thinking it might be my comrade Fred Borders. These thoughts and feelings passed quickly. The shriek still rang in my ears when the captain roared. He threw a light hen-coop overboard, and the mate did the same with an oar instantly. Without thinking, I grabbed oakum and rubbish, lit it, and threw it into the sea. Hope arose seeing it burn, but as it went astern, despair set in. I remembered my mother's advice to pray in trouble and did so earnestly. I prayed for my friend's safety.

Whales and fish have many differences. Whales are warm-blooded, while fish are cold-blooded. Whales give birth to live young, while most fish lay eggs. Whales breathe air through lungs, not gills, and must surface to breathe. They discharge water mixed with air through their blowholes when they come up to breathe. A remarkable difference is that whales suckle their young. A whale calf is born about fourteen feet long and weighs about a ton. The cow-whale shows affection and anxiety towards its calf. Whales, unlike heartless fish, care for their offspring. Whales have been observed protecting their young, even when in danger. There are various types of whales, with the common right whale and the sperm whale being the most sought after. The sperm whale is known for its large teeth and blunt head, which can be one-third of its body length. It feeds on cuttle-fish and can be fierce when provoked, sometimes attacking boats. Fighting-whales, especially old bulls, can be a challenge for whalers due to their strength and aggression.|['1.

It is rare for a sperm whale to attack a ship, but there are documented cases of such encounters. One such incident involved the American whaleship _Essex_ in 1819. While hunting sperm whales in the South Pacific, the crew faced a colossal whale that struck the ship, causing it to sink. The men took to their boats, and the whale, seemingly injured, circled back and rammed the ship, leading to its demise. The crew, left stranded in open boats, endured extreme hardships. Some perished, while others reached a desolate island. A few chose to stay behind, hoping for rescue, while the rest embarked on a perilous journey towards Juan Fernandez. Only five out of the twenty men survived this harrowing ordeal, with some resorting to cannibalism to stay alive.|"[""1.

"Before continuing my story, I want to mention a significant detail about sperm whales. Inside the head of a sperm whale, there is a large hole known as the ""case"" that holds pure oil called spermaceti. This oil doesn't need to be melted and can be easily stored in casks. Spermaceti is valuable and used to make high-quality candles. A single whale can provide around fifteen barrels of spermaceti oil from its head. Larger whales can yield up to a hundred barrels of oil. Whales are not naturally aggressive; in fact, they tend to avoid fights. The ""right"" whale is timid and only fights to protect its young. When hunted, sperm whales usually flee. They have three main enemies: the swordfish, the thrasher, and the killer whale. The swordfish attacks by stabbing the whale with its horn, while the thrasher leaps onto the whale's back and strikes it with its tail. The killer whale is the most dangerous, as it is swift and strong, capable of overpowering even large whales."|"['1.

Fred Borders, a knowledgeable and observant shipmate, shared an intriguing story with his fellow sailors. He recounted an incident involving a young doctor on their voyage to the Greenland Seas. The doctor was curious about the green tint of the sea in certain areas and embarked on a study. He collected sea-water, examined it closely, and discovered an astonishing fact. In every square mile of sea-water, there existed an unimaginable number of tiny creatures. The doctor calculated that there were approximately eleven quadrillions, nine hundred and ninety-nine trillions of these creatures in each square mile. To put this vast number into perspective, he explained that it would take forty thousand men counting continuously to reach this staggering figure. The young doctor's dedication to learning and exploring the mysteries of the sea left a lasting impression on his shipmates, showcasing the value of curiosity and education.|['1.

"Tom Lokins, a seasoned sailor, explained to Fred that calculating big numbers required months of hard work. However, Fred disagreed, recalling advice from a clergyman who claimed it could be done in just half an hour with good arithmetic skills. Suddenly, a massive whale appeared, and the crew sprang into action, launching boats to pursue it. As they rowed, smaller whales surrounded them, oblivious to the danger. The crew focused on the colossal whale, believed to be the infamous ""New Zealand Tom."" With adrenaline pumping, they maneuvered their boat close to the whale. The captain commanded them to back away just in time to avoid the whale's powerful tail. The crew watched in awe as the wounded whale thrashed in the water, turning the sea red with blood."|"['1.

Suddenly, everything stopped. Before we could even react, the whale dove deep, pulling the line so fast that the boat spun and sparks flew. The captain yelled, and we raced across the sea, foam towering ahead. Other whales surfaced nearby. As we neared the first mate's boat, we saw he was busy with a catch. The line slackened, and we reeled it in as the captain readied his lance. The whale resurfaced, and we rowed towards it. Instead of fleeing, it charged us. I feared the worst as it bore down on us, but the captain's skill saved us. We struggled with the whale, but it was cunning, evading us. Finally, the captain struck a fatal blow. The whale bled, a sign of its defeat, but it fought on. As the line pulled taut, chaos ensued. I was thrown overboard, sinking fast. Amid the turmoil, thoughts of life and eternity raced through my mind until, miraculously, I surfaced, gasping for air.|"['1.

When I surfaced, I spotted the boat just fifty yards away. Being a strong swimmer, I swam towards it despite feeling exhausted. My comrades saw me and rowed towards me. As they pulled me in, the whale surfaced close by, its massive head towering over us. The captain shouted to steer away, but the whale crashed onto our boat, sending us into chaos. Miraculously, no lives were lost, and we were rescued by the mate's boat. We watched as the wounded whale resurfaced, its struggles ending in a calm, silent death. We towed the massive creature back to the ship, where it yielded ninety barrels of oil, worth 500 pounds.|"['1.

Our voyage had been successful until tragedy struck on a calm Sunday morning. While chatting with the first mate, a seasoned but gruff man, we lost a crew member. Whaling life is filled with risks, and we had already faced challenges like losing fish and equipment. But this loss was different. The first mate, a Yankee who valued everything in dollars, recounted a harrowing experience in the Greenland Seas. They had a relentless encounter with a massive whale that towed them for over thirty-six hours, defying all attempts to stop it. The crew's resilience was tested as they battled the beast, finally prevailing after forty hours of intense struggle. This tale of perseverance and loss serves as a reminder of the dangers and uncertainties of life at sea.|"[""1.

Some of my crewmates questioned the tale, but I trusted it. The mate, though stern, was honest. A similar event occurred aboard the _Royal Bounty_ in 1817. I understand these stories may seem unbelievable, but those who've ventured to the whale-fishery know their truth. Captain Scoresby's accounts are as astonishing as mine. Once, a whale in Greenland pulled over six miles of line. During a whale hunt, a large sperm whale surfaced near us. We engaged in a fierce battle, harpooning the whale repeatedly. When the whale finally dived, it resurfaced under the captain's boat, causing chaos. Many were injured, with one man's leg broken. Amidst the chaos, Fred Borders, severely wounded, whispered his first words.|"[""1.

During our long voyage, we encountered a Yankee whale-ship, and the meeting was a delightful gam. A gam is a jovial gathering of crews from different ships at sea. It's a rare opportunity for sailors to socialize and share news. We were overjoyed to have a chance to interact with new faces and hear stories from afar. The excitement of the encounter lifted our spirits, providing a break from the routine of whale-fishing. Despite the absence of women, the camaraderie among sailors was heartwarming. The exchange of tales and experiences made the day memorable. As we sailed towards the Yankee ship, the anticipation of connecting with fellow seafarers filled us with eagerness and curiosity.|['1.

We were thrilled to find out that the Yankee ship had recently engaged in a friendly competition with an English vessel. As a result, we returned to our own ship with a collection of old newspapers from England. We invited the Yankee captain and crew to spend the day with us. While we awaited their arrival, two of our crew members, Tom Lokins and Bill Blunt, grabbed a couple of newspapers to share the news with the rest of the eager sailors. However, their simultaneous reading caused confusion among the listeners. Tom excitedly recounted a story of a mountain fortress explosion in India, while Bill revealed a humorous mix-up involving two women named Susan Crofts. As we prepared to welcome our guests, both ships were captivated by a dramatic scene unfolding in the water - a whale struggling against a killer fish. Despite our attempts to intervene, the killer fish ultimately prevailed, and the Yankee crew claimed the prize. Later that evening, we shared stories, songs, and laughter with our Yankee visitors, making for a memorable night of camaraderie at sea.|"['1.
