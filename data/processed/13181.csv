Life in America today is full of adventure and excitement. There are ongoing border conflicts in remote mountain regions, crimes are being committed, and piracy has now shifted from the sea to the land. Smugglers are actively trading, and many children are in need of rescue from harsh conditions. The call for volunteers is widespread, with the Census Bureau leading the way in dangerous scout missions. The Census is a powerful tool that reveals hidden truths and the Enumerator holds the key to vital information. The aim is to showcase the diverse population of the United States and the Census plays a crucial role in shaping policies and decisions. The Census data impacts everything from congressional representation to food production and transportation. Aspiring to be an assistant special agent in the Census of Manufactures, Hamilton recognizes the significance of this important work.|['1.

In the mountains, an old feud is fading, mainly due to education. The younger generation isn't seeking revenge, influencing the women. A schoolmaster once visited, impressed by the mountain folk's English lineage and independence. He explained how hard it is to rise after a fall, like the mountaineers' struggle. With no market access, they lived like pioneers, falling behind as the world progressed. Despite hardships, they held onto old values of honor and hospitality. This history shapes their unique way of life, making them fiercely independent yet tied to tradition.|"['1.

The old man likened the mountaineers to shipwrecked sailors stranded without a boat, lacking education, churching, and legal support. He believed that given a fair chance, the mountaineers of Kentucky and other states could show their worth. Despite their rough exterior, the mountaineers had a strong sense of honor and justice. An anecdote about the Beaupoint family illustrated this. In a feud with the Calverns, the Beaupoints showed remarkable forgiveness and kindness. Even after a tragic incident resulting in death, the Beaupoints cared for the widow and raised her son as their own. They eventually returned the farm and belongings to the boy, offering him a choice between seeking revenge or letting go of the past. This story highlighted the mountaineers' values of integrity, forgiveness, and respect.|"['1.

In the mountains of Kentucky, feuds between families were once common. Johnny Calvern sought peace, willing to pause the feud for ten years for his wife and child. Despite good intentions, trouble often arose from hot-headed individuals meddling in others' affairs. The McCoy-Hatfield feud began over hogs but escalated due to forbidden friendships. The Logan-Tolliver feud sparked over a sheriff election, while the French-Eversole feud was a business rivalry. The Turner War in Bell County started over water rights. The Hargis-Cockrill feud in Breathitt County lasted generations from an election dispute. The Baker-Howard feud, involving four families, was the last known feud, with a widow vowing vengeance until her sons avenged their father's death. Today, peace prevails, but the echoes of past conflicts linger in the hills of Kentucky.|"['1.

"During a conversation about the causes of old feuds, a mountaineer shared a story from the Civil War era. He recounted an incident involving a skirmish near Cumberland Gap where he encountered an enemy, Isaac Howkle, from the opposing cavalry. Despite their history of disagreements, the mountaineer found himself in a dangerous situation when Howkle attacked him. Fortunately, the mountaineer managed to evade the sabre strike and retaliated with his rifle, though Howkle escaped into the trees. The mountaineer then described a poignant moment when he tried to help a wounded young soldier from the other side, who whispered, ""Don't blame the Union,"" showing his concern for his side's reputation over his own pain. The mountaineer reflected on the war, emphasizing that most soldiers, like the young lad, fought for their beliefs rather than personal gain."|"['1.

"""That's the right way to talk,"" the elderly soldier agreed. ""Well, if you feel that way about it, I guess there's no harm in me telling you the rest of it now that I've started. When the war ended and I returned here, I remembered what had happened. I sent word to Isaac Howkle that I didn't trust him. I thought he might be waiting for a chance to harm me after what he did. I wasn't looking to start a feud at all,"" the old man reflected, ""it was just a personal dispute between Isaac Howkle and me. There were many times I could have harmed his brothers, but I was only wary of Isaac. He did shoot someone, my brother-in-law. I met his brothers several times but never had any issues with them. It was just between Isaac and me. I found him once, but I couldn't shoot without warning him. I shouted to him, and before he could shoot, someone else fired behind me. Howkle thought I shot him, but my gun was never fired. They never got involved in the story. I'm telling you this to advise you to stay away from this area if you plan on doing census work. It's best to go somewhere where you're not known. There's enough trouble even for a stranger in the mountains, and they'd find it easier than anyone else. You can't be rude to a stranger.

"Hamilton observed the mountain boy closely. Despite his frail appearance, the boy had trekked eight miles and was planning to walk back home that evening. Hamilton realized the boy was one of the impoverished locals he had read about. As Hamilton approached, the boy casually remarked he was feeling ""tol'able"" and inquired if Hamilton was from the city. The boy then shared a tale about a schoolmaster accused of aiding revenue men, emphasizing the teacher's kindness to him. The boy recounted an eerie incident involving a man named Blacky Baldwin using a mysterious horn to curse the teacher with a fear of falling.

"""That was only the beginning,"" the storyteller continued. ""About half an hour later, one of the boys accidentally dropped his slate pencil, and it broke. He asked the teacher for a new one. The slates and pencils were kept on a shelf above the teacher's chair. As he climbed the chair to reach one down, suddenly he groaned, his eyes rolled back, and his face turned pale. Two boys thought he had a stroke and tried to help, but he didn't respond. They had to pry his hands off the shelf. The teacher then sat down, staring ahead as if in a trance. We all suspected it was conjuring. When we left, Old Blacky Baldwin was waiting, looking unchanged. As I passed, he said, 'School's out early today, boys.' I ran home as fast as I could. Most of us returned to school after a while, but the teacher was different. He'd have episodes where he acted as if he was falling. Some kids never came back, fearing the haunting. Blacky Baldwin lurked around muttering to himself. Eventually, the teacher vanished, and we suspected he either fell or left without a trace.""

"""None of the mountain people know about it,"" answered the elderly man.

"""The South is experiencing a significant growth,"" the elderly man mentioned. ""If you're involved in the upcoming census, keep an eye on the numbers to witness the resurgence of the old South.

""There's quite a steady sale. The big fellows are sometimes sold alive to parks and aquariums and circuses, but most of them are killed and the whole skins dressed and used for hanging on the walls of dens, like trophies.

Upon arriving at the hotel, Hamilton eagerly examined his portfolio. The schedules felt familiar as he had previously filled out similar ones during an examination. The written instructions, although scattered with percentage figures, were clear and left no room for confusion. New Haven, an old New England center and college town, provided an intriguing backdrop for Hamilton's work. The majority of the people he encountered were of old American descent and were more than willing to assist him. Hamilton found the New Englanders to be proud Americans, always ready to contribute to the country's well-being. The boy's encounters with different businesses, including Italian marble-cutters, Chinese trinket makers, and Persian fringe manufacturers, provided him with valuable insights.

"""It is important to maintain consistent hardness in gun parts,"" explained the guide. ""To achieve this, all pieces are annealed to ensure uniformity. The process involves careful monitoring of temperature to prevent variations in hardness due to cooling rates. The barrels, a crucial component, undergo meticulous testing to guarantee precision. Each barrel is bored with extreme precision, and then tested for size accuracy down to a fraction of an inch. Any deviation results in rejection. Additionally, rigorous tests are conducted throughout the gun-making process to eliminate imperfections. A dramatic demonstration of this quality control is a test where gun barrels are filled with powder and subjected to pressure.

In the traditional method, each part is handled individually. This allows for adjustments based on slight differences in the metal. However, modern machines treat all parts uniformly. An expert examines the barrel using a ground glass with a black line. By aiming the barrel correctly, a reflection of the line should be seen. Another test involves pushing a lead slug through the barrel to detect slight diameter variations. Tests are conducted on trigger pull, cartridge ejection, hammer fall, and magazine filling. Skilled marksmen test the accuracy of the gun by firing shots at a target. A shotgun's shot pattern is scrutinized for accuracy within a specific radius. These meticulous tests ensure that firearms meet strict quality standards before being approved for use.|"['1.

Hamilton, a diligent census taker, found himself unexpectedly meeting three men in the woods. The men, named 'Hatchet' Ben Barclay, 'Jolly' Joe Smith, and Harry Downe, welcomed Hamilton. They humorously shared that they had not been listed in the census despite encounters with other census takers. Hamilton, intrigued, engaged in a friendly conversation with the men. 'Hatchet' Ben explained their preference for a nomadic lifestyle over a settled one, highlighting their diverse interests and educational backgrounds.

Hamilton recommended adding two Americans and an Englishman to the schedule to improve the overall representation. 'Hatchet Ben' expressed his willingness to be one of them, emphasizing his disdain for the influx of foreigners taking jobs from locals. The 'Windy Duke' chimed in, praising the independence and resilience of tramps, attributing their lifestyle to a protest against societal norms. The conversation delved into the exploitation of foreign workers by companies, leading to wage reductions and unfair treatment of American workers like 'Hatchet Ben.'

Three men, 'Jolly Joe,' the 'Windy Duke,' and Hamilton, shared their diverse experiences. 'Jolly Joe' embraced the hobo life, finding it more suitable for his talents than labor. The 'Windy Duke' chose vagrancy to support his family and adventurous spirit. Hamilton, a former railroad worker, shared his unfortunate encounter with an Italian gang. The men discussed the challenges faced by Americans in various situations. Hamilton pondered on the hoboes' potential as citizens under different circumstances. The supervisor later revealed that one applicant for the census was a student named Wurtzi, contrasting the varied paths individuals may take.|"[""1.

"""Yes, he's nineteen. As I was saying, the choice seemed to lie between these two.

In the lesson, Hamilton explained the codes used on census cards. For example, 'S' means Single, 'M' for Married, 'Wd' for Widowed, 'D' for Divorced, and 'Un' for Unknown. The term 'Mother Tongue' refers to the primary language spoken by a person. In Wales, the mother tongue is Welsh, but not everyone speaks it. So, an English-speaking Welshman's card would be marked 'OL' for Other Language. Similarly, in Denmark, if German is the second most important language after Danish, a person speaking German as their native language would be marked 'OL' on the card. The codes 'U.S.' and 'Un.' represent birthplace and unknown parentage. 'NP' and 'FP' stand for native-born and foreign-born parents. Other codes like 'Na' for Naturalized, 'Al' for Alien, and 'Pa' for first papers taken out are also used. The occupation section lists various jobs classified with numbers. Codes like 'Emp' for Employer, 'W' for Wage Earner, 'OA' for working on their own account, and 'Un' for Unemployed are also explained.|"[""1.

Hamilton spent the afternoon working diligently on a set of cards, grasping the principles behind the task. The next morning, he found a real schedule at his machine, ready to go. He was warned that errors were not allowed, and each card had to be accounted for. The machine's operator explained the importance of correct numbering on the cards. As Hamilton grew more comfortable with the machine, he explored the verification department to understand its workings. The chief explained that the machine used mercury to transmit electric currents for verification. Hamilton learned that each card's unique combination of holes ensured accuracy. The machine could detect 23 different errors, like mismatched data, to ensure the cards were correct.|"['1.

Hamilton and the chief were discussing the process of handling punched cards for tabulation. The chief explained that any field without a punch in every card would be rejected, except for the age column which required a punch in every field. The cards were checked against original schedules, and any errors were corrected by punching new cards. The cards were sorted using machinery, not by eyesight, saving time and labor. The chief described how the cards were kept organized by location, district, and state, simplifying the tabulating process. The tabulating machine used electrical connections to count and print data from the cards automatically. The supervisor showcased a new machine that fed, verified, and tabulated cards quickly, making the census process more efficient.

In Alaska, the men of the service faced extreme weather conditions, trekking hundreds of miles in temperatures as low as 70 degrees below zero. The lack of beaten trails meant they had to snow-shoe ahead of their dog-teams. Despite the isolation and harsh conditions, these men visited remote prospectors' cabins and claims, making sacrifices to deliver supplies. One enumerator survived on fresh meat, facing freezing temperatures and dangerous terrain. Another man got caught in a blizzard but was rescued just in time. Traveling in Alaska meant enduring bitter cold, treacherous rivers, and navigating trackless wilderness. The challenges were immense, with no beaten trails or bridges across swollen rivers.

"The Census Bureau is a bustling place with work happening before and after the Decennial Census. Besides the main census, there are other important tasks like the Quinquennial Census of Manufactures and tracking Religious Bodies, Marriage, and Divorce Statistics. The Bureau compiles vital statistics useful for doctors worldwide and studies cotton crop conditions. They also handle statistics for cities over 30,000 inhabitants and assist with questions related to population and manufacturing. The Bureau collaborates on forest product statistics and provides data requested by Congress or executive departments.

The Alaskan recounted a chilling encounter with a mysterious snow phenomenon. He described how the snow began to writhe and stir, as if a creature was awakening. A column of snow shot up like a geyser, reaching a hundred feet high. The snow pillar moved towards them silently, swirling and dancing like spectral figures under the snow-filled sky.
