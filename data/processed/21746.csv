In the quiet hour before sunrise, the sea was calm like glass. The expected breeze never came, so the boatmen rowed towards land. The big man mentioned the lack of wind would make landing on the rock easier. As they rowed, the sea changed from grey to saffron, then to liquid gold as the sun rose. They were headed for the dreaded Bell Rock, a danger to sailors. Despite the calm surface, the ocean swelled from a recent storm. The boatmen, Jock Swankie and Davy, spotted the rock in the blazing sun. They rowed towards it, anticipating a catch of cod or haddock before the rock emerged. Fishing near the foam, they soon had a dozen fish in the boat.|"['1. What was the sea like in the quiet hour before sunrise?\nA. Stormy\nB. Calm like glass\nC. Choppy\nD. Foggy\nE. Icy', '2.

Davy's speech ended abruptly with a groan when the fish escaped due to the line breaking. At low tide, part of the Bell Rock is exposed for a few hours, appearing as ledges with seaweed and pools. Landing there is risky, with violent waves. The fishermen, skilled in navigating the area, approached cautiously. Swankie found valuables in a wreck debris pile, including a dead man with jewelry and a purse of sovereigns. Swankie concealed the purse as Davy arrived. They continued searching the rocks for items of interest. Swankie's discovery of the valuables heightened their excitement.|"[""1.

Two friends, Swankie and Davy Spink, were scavenging a shipwreck when they stumbled upon a dead man with a mysterious note. Despite their efforts, Davy couldn't decipher the writing due to his lack of education. They found various items of value, including a bag of gold and a jewel-case. After a coin toss, they divided the loot. They loaded the heavier items onto their boat and set off, facing challenges with the surf. Eventually, they sailed into Arbroath harbor, leaving behind the treacherous Bell Rock. Meanwhile, a young girl and a young man separately made their way to the wild cliffs near Arbroath. The girl noticed the young man's approach, hinting at a connection between them. Unbeknownst to them, they were being watched by a group of men, including a navy lieutenant.|"['1.

Swimming carefully near the rocks, Ruby found a sea-filled cavern. Inside, a hole led up the cliffs. Ruby climbed cautiously to the top. There, a seaman named Dalls lay asleep. Ruby nearly scalped Dalls while climbing. Dalls woke in a fury, but Ruby swiftly subdued him. The scuffle attracted a press-gang. Ruby fled towards Arbroath. The gang gave chase, but Ruby outpaced them. At the gorge, he faced three men. Ruby dodged them, leaped up the wall, and overpowered two men. The third wisely stepped aside.

Ruby Brand, a brave and gentle young man, bid farewell to Minnie as he faced a group of men rushing towards them. With a kiss on Minnie's hand and a wave of his cap, he fled towards Arbroath, leaving Minnie in safe hands. Upon reaching the outskirts of Arbroath, Ruby strolled into town as if returning from a leisurely walk. His destination was his mother's cottage near the harbor. Mrs. Brand, a kind and unselfish woman, welcomed Ruby, her only child, back home. Ruby had stayed to care for his mother due to her delicate health. Ruby's father, a sailor, captained the sloop _Penguin_, which tragically met its end in a storm. In those days, news traveled slowly, and disasters like shipwrecks were not widely reported.

"The powerful storm caused immense destruction, leading to numerous shipwrecks along the treacherous coasts due to the lack of lighthouses and lifeboats. Wreckers took advantage of the chaos, sometimes even causing wrecks themselves to profit from the misfortune. The Bell Rock, a perilous reef off Forfarshire, was particularly hazardous, causing vessels to either run aground on it or dangerously veer towards other shores to avoid it.

Amidst this turmoil, Ruby's father tragically perished in a shipwreck, leaving Ruby's mother widowed and in need of support. With limited job opportunities in town, Ruby had to turn to the sea for work. Despite the challenges, Ruby's family found solace in the kindness of relatives and Minnie Gray's sewing skills, which helped sustain them during this difficult time.

As Ruby embarked on his new journey at sea, his uncle, Captain Ogilvy, offered him heartfelt advice and encouragement, emphasizing the importance of staying vigilant and navigating life's challenges with care. The captain's departure marked a new chapter for Ruby, filled with hope and the wisdom passed down from generations of seafaring experience."|"['1.

Captain Ogilvy happily strolled back to his sister's cottage, whistling a merry tune as he made his way through the streets. His cheerful demeanor was interrupted when he accidentally bumped into Big Swankie and Davy Spink, who were planning a burglary. Despite Swankie's attempts to involve Spink in their scheme, Spink refused to partake in the criminal act. Spink, a smuggler, drew the line at theft and declined to join the burglary plan. Swankie, realizing he couldn't sway Spink, left in a hurry to meet the Badger, leaving Spink to head home. The burglars targeted a wealthy widow's house that night, unaware that her son, Major Stewart, had returned from India. The widow's house was guarded by a high wall topped with bottle-glass, deterring most intruders. Unbeknownst to the burglars, the widow's son's unexpected arrival would foil their plans.|"[""1.

During a storm, Major Stewart attempted to catch burglars, but they escaped. The major got hurt and returned home to find the cook fainting. The burglars left behind stolen items. Meanwhile, the Bell Rock was notorious for shipwrecks, and a legend tells of a pirate cutting a warning bell. Eventually, a lighthouse was built on the rock in the 19th century after a storm in 1799 caused many shipwrecks. The storm forced ships to seek shelter in the estuaries of the Humber, Forth, and Moray Firths. However, mistaking one for the other led to more disasters during the storm. Over seventy ships were lost, and many sailors perished, emphasizing the need for better navigation aids.|"['1.

At a treacherous part of the coast near Peterhead, called the Bullers of Buchan, seven shipwrecks were discovered after a stormy night, with no survivors to recount the tragedy. The dangers of the shore can be more perilous than those of the sea. Sailors prefer the safety of deep waters during storms. To make the Forth more navigable and remove the hazard of the Bell Rock, a lighthouse was planned. The task was formidable, as the rock was submerged, only visible at low tide, and inaccessible in bad weather. Engineer Robert Stevenson undertook the challenge, constructing a lighthouse on a submerged reef, a daring feat. The construction faced numerous obstacles but progressed successfully. Ruby, a sailor, embarked on a journey to visit his mother, concealing his identity to avoid past troubles. His arrival brought hope to his struggling family.|"['1.

"""Did you forget the tools?"" exclaimed George Forsyth, a tall carpenter known for his dislike of boats and climbing. He had remembered to bring them, saving the day. As they worked on the Bell Rock Lighthouse foundation, smoke rose from the forge, and the anvil rang out. The site was carefully chosen by Mr. Stevenson for its elevation and protection from the sea. Men were busy hewing the rock and preparing for construction. The scene was a hive of activity, with each man working diligently. From a distance, the workers on the rock appeared like tiny figures against the vast sea and sky.

"The sea had filled the pit earlier, forcing the men out. They gathered tools, leaving nothing behind. Those on higher rocks kept working until the water reached them. Then they packed up and headed to the boats at the western landing. The work was vigorous and exciting, with a touch of romance that suited him well. Initially expecting monotony, he found it quite the opposite. Although the work had a consistent theme, there was constant variety in details. The isolated spot focused their minds, sparking interest in every little thing. Each rock and pool had a name and story. The fish and shellfish were closely observed. The men's limited time spurred them on, leading to quick work and hurried studies of nature during breaks. One morning, before work began, ""Long Forsyth"" spotted a beautiful fish in a pool.

On the Bell Rock, a group of men worked diligently despite the challenging weather conditions. Forsyth, who took the teasing from his companions in good humor, was not deterred by their jokes. The men faced difficulties due to the rough seas and the rolling of their ship, the _Pharos_. Despite the seasickness that prevailed among the crew, the desire to land on the Bell Rock to eat dulse, a type of seaweed, was strong. Landing on the rock was no easy task, especially with the ship rolling violently. Mr. Stevenson, feeling the weight of responsibility for the success of the project and the safety of his team, watched over them diligently. The Bell Rock had a tramway for transporting heavy stones, and various wharves were strategically placed to ensure work could continue regardless of the wind direction. The scene on the ship was a stark contrast to the previous calm and sunny days, with seasickness affecting the crew and meals becoming a dreaded affair.|"['1.

The crew on the ship faced a challenging situation. The bell rang, signaling the men to gather on deck. Despite the rough sea and the looming threat of the Bell Rock, everyone mustered promptly. As they prepared to board the boats alongside the ship, some grabbed biscuits, while others struggled due to the ship's violent rolling. Forsyth, in particular, had a tough time getting into the boat, hesitating and then leaping awkwardly. The crew's orders emphasized the need to give the boats enough speed to navigate the rocky waters safely.

Ruby Brand and a few men quickly maneuvered the boat, facing the waves head-on. After much effort, they launched the boat into deep water and reached the shore. The other boat couldn't help, but the task was completed swiftly. As they couldn't leave until high tide, everyone worked to keep warm. They ate dulse, a seaweed snack, and set up a fire. Despite the challenges with smoke and waves, Ruby and Dove worked tirelessly. They knew a beacon was crucial for safety if the boats faced trouble. Holes were drilled into the rock for the beams, a challenging task. Ruby enjoyed this work, a release for his energy. The men rotated in using the hammers, and progress was better than expected.

The pilot-boat set sail for the floating light after taking on as many people as it could. The other boats followed, but it took them three hours of hard rowing to reach the _Pharos_. The waves constantly splashed into the boats, making it necessary to bail out water. When they finally reached the floating light, getting everyone on board was challenging due to the vessel's rolling motion and the men's exhaustion. Long Forsyth was particularly difficult to handle as he was very ill and could barely move. Despite his plea to be left in the sea, they refused. A glass of rum and hot coffee comforted everyone. Ruby received a letter from Minnie, assuring him that efforts were being made on his behalf.

At ten in the morning, the wind had shifted to the north-east, blowing even harder than before, with a heavier sea swell. To reduce the risk, more cable was paid out. Nearly the entire length of the 120-fathom hempen cable was veered out during the gale. The cable was carefully protected with canvas and leather to prevent chafing. The gentleman in charge of the Bell Rock work faced sleepless nights and anxiety. Around two in the afternoon, a heavy sea struck the ship, causing alarm as water poured in through hatches and skylights. Despite the chaos, Mr. Stevenson ventured on deck, finding a scene of chaos with waves as high as mountains.

Mr. Stevenson saw Ruby's smile and heard the seamen's comments, feeling things weren't as bad as they seemed. He consulted the master and officers about the ship drifting. The master believed they could weather the storm or sail to safety if needed. Suddenly, the ship started drifting, causing panic. The crew acted fast, setting sails and dropping anchor. The steward cheered up everyone with a suet pudding. As the storm calmed, they found relief and hope. The calm after a storm is serene, with waves gently lapping. At the Bell Rock, the waves showed both storm and peace. Waves post-storm rise impressively, crashing with force.

Ruby helped at the foundation-pit pump in the morning. Afterward, he rested on the seaward ledges, watching the waves. Robert Selkirk, the main builder, joined him. Selkirk laid every stone of the lighthouse himself. Despite being quiet, he was full of energy and perseverance. They discussed how thoughts wander when watching the waves and pondered on the lack of focus on the Creator. Selkirk believed it was challenging for people to think deeply about God.

Captain Ogilvy carefully attended to Minnie's needs after both had been soaked by the sea. He swiftly added something to her cup from a small flask before offering it to her. Minnie, smiling, accepted the cup and took a few sips before realizing it had been altered. The captain assured her it was a tonic and encouraged her to drink it all.

"The fatigue that strong men experience when they must wake before they are fully rested quickly fades away. As the two boats trailed just twenty yards behind the _Pharos_, Joe Dumsby exclaimed, ""Ho! boys, let's race."" A small hand waved from a window of the floating light. Ruby waved back, but the men, drawn by Ned's comment to the vessel, saw the gesture. Each man claimed it as a nod to himself, cheering loudly and laughing at Ruby's mix of irritation and embarrassment. The other boat had surged ahead at the mention of a race, causing the men to forget the incident in their eagerness to catch up. Both boats raced at full speed to the rock. Meanwhile, the _Smeaton's_ boat readied to take the strangers aboard the sloop. As the workers landed on the rock, the _Smeaton_ unfurled its sails and sailed to Arbroath. Initially, seals were abundant on the rock, but they eventually left due to the noise and activity. Building the lighthouse faced numerous challenges. The foundation was just above the water, and landing the heavy, fragile stones was a crucial task. Different methods were proposed, but Mr. Stevenson opted for praam boats to transport the stones from Arbroath to the rock, where they were carefully placed in position. Each stone was handled meticulously to ensure its safe delivery and installation."|"[""1.

In the process of constructing the lighthouse on the Bell Rock, each stone was meticulously handled to ensure its safe placement. The stones were carefully lifted and lowered onto the praam boat with precision. The boat was then rowed to a buoy and anchored until the tide was right for further transport to the landing area. Every stone was securely fastened to its neighboring stones using dovetails, joggles, oaken trenails, and mortar. This meticulous process ensured that no stone was lost or damaged during the four-year construction period. The tower was built layer by layer, with the lower part made of sandstone and the outer casing of granite. The beacon house was another challenging aspect of the project, requiring swift engineering efforts to prevent it from being swept away by adverse weather conditions. Despite the complexity of the work, only a few accidents occurred, showcasing the skill and dedication of the workers involved.|['1.

When the sixth and final log was being hoisted into place at the beacon, disaster struck. The iron hook of the main pulley broke, causing the massive fifty-foot beam to crash onto the rock. Miraculously, none of the fifty-two workers were injured, and the beam was largely undamaged. Soon after the beacon's setup, a fierce gale tested its resilience. Despite the violent sea and strong winds, the beacon stood firm. The workers faced challenges, but with careful attention to the weather, they made progress. Eventually, the beacon was strengthened to withstand any storm. Public worship was held on Sundays, and the workers, including the blacksmith James Dove, persevered through challenges to advance the construction of the lighthouse.|"['1.

The day was calm, but the landing on the rock was tough due to recent waves. The crews managed to land after a few close calls. The bellows were left at the beacon instead of the forge. Moving the bellows daily was a hassle for the men, yet crucial for work. After a call, the smithy's tools were transported to the beacon. Ruby cheered for the Dovecot after the setup. Dinner was served on the Bell Rock for the first time. During work, Ruby and James went to their work area. Unexpectedly, Ruby was arrested, causing a stir among the men. Despite efforts to rescue him, Ruby accepted his fate with dignity. The men joked and continued their work, respecting the law.|"['1.

That evening, our hero found himself in the Arbroath jail. He was soon put on trial and, just as Captain Ogilvy had predicted, he was found innocent. After his release, he spent the winter with his mother, sharing a room with his uncle in their small cottage. Ruby, lying in his hammock, pondered the future in the darkness, only lit by the glowing ember of the captain's pipe. The captain, a pipe enthusiast, struggled to keep his pipe alight while discussing future plans with Ruby. Despite the nightly mishaps with the pipe, the captain had devised a plan to avoid disturbance between his nightly smoke and sleep. The next day, the captain planned to visit the workyard and investigate some smuggling activity, inviting Ruby along for a short cruise.|"[""1. **Question:** What was the outcome of the hero's trial in the Arbroath jail?\n- A) He was found guilty\n- B) He was acquitted\n- C) He was sentenced to prison\n- D) He was fined\n- E) The outcome is not mentioned"", '2. **Question:** How did Ruby spend the winter after his release from jail?\n- A) Travelling to exotic locations\n- B) Living in a mansion\n- C) Sharing a room with his mother\n- D) Staying at a hotel\n- E) The text does not provide this information', '3. **Question:** What was the captain doing while discussing future plans with Ruby?\n- A) Playing the guitar\n- B) Reading a book\n- C) Smoking a pipe\n- D) Cooking dinner\n- E) Sleeping', '4. **Question:** How did the captain plan to avoid disturbance between his nightly smoke and sleep?\n- A) By asking Ruby to leave the room\n- B) By smoking outside\n- C) By not smoking at all\n- D) By using a different type of pipe\n- E) The text does not mention any plan', '5. **Question:** What did the captain invite Ruby to do the next day?\n- A) Go shopping\n- B) Attend a party\n- C) Visit the workyard and investigate smuggling activity\n- D) Stay at home\n- E) The text does not mention any invitation', ""6. **Question:** What was the lighting situation while Ruby pondered the future in the darkness?\n- A) Bright daylight\n- B) Moonlight\n- C) Candlelight\n- D) Glowing ember from the captain's pipe\n- E) The text does not mention any lighting""]"|"['** B) He was acquitted', '** C) Sharing a room with his mother', '** C) Smoking a pipe', '** B) By smoking outside', '** C) Visit the workyard and investigate smuggling activity', ""** D) Glowing ember from the captain's pipe""]"
The captain often mentioned that even the smallest things in life can be pondered upon by philosophical individuals. He found interest in observing the survival of some clay pipes each morning after they fell the night before. This made him contemplate the nature of clay pipes and test them. While he didn't claim any significant results from his studies, he believed in seeking facts. One discovery he made was that pipes from one maker always broke, while those from another broke less frequently. This led him to conclude that one maker was honest and the other questionable, influencing his choice of whom to patronize. The workyard at Arbroath was a hub of activity, with barracks for workers, offices, workshops, and sheds. A circular platform was used to test and mark stones for the lighthouse. Captain Ogilvy and Ruby explored the yard, eventually reaching a building where Jamie Dove was working. They discussed a sail in the afternoon to benefit Ruby's mother. The lieutenant joined them, prompting Ruby to wonder about his relationship status with Minnie.|"['1.

The captain told his nephew, Ruby, and Lieutenant Lindsay to meet at the pier in five minutes. Ruby admired Minnie's beauty, but jealousy flared when he saw the lieutenant's interest. They rowed along the coast on a calm, sunny day, exploring caves. Minnie expressed her desire for a boat to explore more. Ruby's heart fluttered, but the lieutenant's attention to the captain made him feel unappreciated. The captain then shared a historical tale about a battle from 1445, where two families clashed.

""I have heard of Captain Fall,"" Minnie replied, ""but not of the deeds of the Ogilvy you mention.""

"Lindsay continued, ""The town was in chaos, with no means to defend itself. There were no soldiers, no militia, and no volunteers. People ran aimlessly, leaderless, resembling fish scattered by a boy in a pool. Eventually, the Provost, an elderly and wise man, along with town leaders, went to the beach to meet a flag of truce. The boat arrived, armed sailors presented a letter from Captain Fall demanding surrender. The Provost, seeking time, sent a messenger for soldiers and requested terms for surrender. When the French officer received the Provost's note, he demanded a hefty ransom and hostages. The Provost defiantly refused, inviting the Frenchman ashore for a different outcome.

Minnie agreed to explore the cave after encouragement from Ruby. They climbed the cliffs and followed a narrow path by the coast. The cliffs were steep with no refuge for ships. Inland, the landscape sloped gently towards the sea. A peculiar hole in a field had a cavern where the sea entered, resembling a boiling pot. Ruby assured Minnie of safety as they descended into the cave. Inside, the dimly lit cave fascinated them. They noticed a boat entering the cave with two fishermen rowing.

Spink, with sudden anger, refused to help find the jewels of a dead man he found on the Bell Rock. Big Swankie lit a torch, revealing the cavern's eerie forms. Ruby and Minnie hid, fearing the smugglers. Swankie decided to hide the kegs among the rocks due to the rising tide. The smugglers rowed away, planning to return to Auchmithie. Ruby saw an opportunity to intercept them. After digging up the kegs, they hurried to the bay. Ruby carried the heavy kegs as Minnie followed, laughing at the thought of the smugglers' surprise.

The sailor and the lieutenant were in a boat chasing smugglers under the moonlight. The lieutenant doubted if the men were truly smugglers since they did not stop to prove their innocence. The sailor, Ruby Brand, offered the captain a taste of gin from a smuggled flask. The captain, after hesitating, took a long drink, indicating his approval.

In the latter part of the speech, Swankie's eyes widened like oysters at the sight of a keg, and Davy Spink's face mirrored the same surprise. Lieutenant Lindsay and his team had a night of work, so the captain decided to drop Minnie, Ruby, and himself a mile from town to walk back. While one group strolled along a cliff path, the others rowed to explore the Forbidden Cave. Ruby saved money for his marriage to Minnie by working hard during the winter. Despite Ruby's impulsive nature, he heeded his mother's advice to save for a rainy day before marrying Minnie. The group discussed the mysterious findings at Gaylet Cove, linking Swankie to possible misdeeds. The engineers revisited the Bell Rock after winter storms, finding the beacon intact despite nature's harsh blows.

Mr. Stevenson realized the practicality of transforming the beacon into a refuge and residence for workers. This change brought hope to Jamie Dove, who longed to leave the floating light behind and live on solid ground. Jamie's dream of residing on the Bell Rock seemed absurd in the past, but now it was becoming a reality. The engineers confirmed the beacon's stability and found provisions stored in case of emergencies. Despite burst water bottles, the site offered a safe haven. As the sea grew rough, the team secured the boats to the beacon for safety. The engineers then made the beacon their temporary home, a wooden structure on the rock's surface. The house had multiple levels, including a mortar gallery, a cook-room, living quarters, and a barrack-room. Mr. Stevenson's cabin was small but efficiently utilized, featuring a cot and essential supplies.|"['1.

In a remote location, the engineer's accommodations were limited, and the men's barracks housed only twenty-one. The beacon house was a work in progress, initially used as a workshop and temporary shelter during fair weather. The structure was partially sheltered, with a roof covered in tarpaulin and coated with tar. Bremner, accompanied by his loyal black dog, opted to stay on the rock alone. As the boats departed, leaving him isolated, he felt a mix of unease and determination. The night started well, but the rising tide and swell created a sense of desolation.

The workers on the Bell Rock were busy with various tasks related to construction. The blacksmiths were sharpening tools and making iron pieces, while the landing-master's crew helped with laying railways. Seamen did most of the miscellaneous work that laborers would typically do. They even handled tasks like fitting picks to handles. The work progressed quickly because the men could stay on the beacon, working day and night. The night sky was dark and calm, with the forge fires casting a glow over the rock. The sound of tools and waves crashing filled the air. Ned and Dove were working with hammers on the beacon and rock, respectively. As stormy weather approached, the fish left the area for safety. Peter Logan and Bremner monitored the weather while the men sought refuge in the beacon house as the sea covered the rock. The scene changed dramatically as the torches went out, leaving the men in darkness before the waves engulfed the rock.

"""Hello, students! Let's talk about the fascinating history of the Eddystone Lighthouse. Over a hundred years ago, in 1696, the construction of this lighthouse began to guide sailors away from the treacherous Eddystone Rocks. These rocks, located in the British Channel, were notorious for causing shipwrecks until the lighthouse was built. The first lighthouse was constructed by Mr. Winstanley, a clever inventor known for his quirky gadgets. Despite facing challenges due to the distance from land, he completed the lighthouse in four years. Unfortunately, the lighthouse was destroyed in a storm in 1703. However, a new lighthouse was built in 1708, standing tall for forty-nine years. The legacy of the Eddystone Lighthouse continues to illuminate the seas and guide ships safely to this day."""|['1.

The lighthouse, once completed, had two keepers responsible for signaling when help was needed. Unfortunately, one of the keepers fell ill and passed away. The remaining keeper raised the flag for assistance, but due to bad weather, help couldn't reach them for four weeks. Fearful of being accused, he kept the deceased keeper's body with him. Later, a tragic incident occurred when the lighthouse caught fire. Despite efforts, it burned down, and only the keepers were rescued. One went mad, another died from inhaling melted lead. The third Eddystone Lighthouse, built from 1756 to 1759, with 24 candles, was a testament to Mr. Smeaton's dedication. The story reflects on the importance of faith and determination in overcoming challenges.|"['1.

The job at the lighthouse was regular but not dull, with occasional accidents and incidents breaking the monotony. Landing the boats in rough weather was always a source of anxiety and sometimes amusement. Visitors to the rock were rare, and accidents were fewer than expected, except for one incident where a worker lost a finger due to the balance crane. This crane, a unique contraption, was crucial for lifting heavy stones to build the tower. Unfortunately, a young worker, James Scott, met a tragic end when a buoy overturned the boat he was in, leaving the community saddened. Despite the loss, the lad's mother showed remarkable strength, accepting help from the authorities and allowing her younger son to join the service in place of his brother.|"['1.

The tall building stood eighty feet high. Suddenly, a massive wave crashed into the lighthouse, shaking it violently. Forsyth, startled, thought the structure might collapse. Water and debris poured in, causing chaos. Forsyth, in a panic, rushed down the stairs as water gushed out, flooding the bridge. Inside, men were playing games and relaxing. Meanwhile, on the beacon, Ruby and his companions were fishing. Ruby's quick actions saved important letters from getting wet, earning him the gratitude of everyone. Despite a brief scare when he was carried away by the tide, Ruby's heroic act was celebrated by all that night.|['1.

At the beacon, a curious scene unfolded as the packet's contents were revealed. Those with letters eagerly devoured them, some even reading aloud by accident. Others without letters turned to the newspapers, while those with neither listened intently. A letter from Minnie to Ruby hinted at a mysterious discovery made with Uncle Ogilvy on the pier. Ruby, frustrated by the lack of details, longed for a clearer explanation. Meanwhile, Neffy's letter expressed a desire for Ruby to return home briefly to shed light on the strange affair. As the _Smeaton_ approached in the fog, Ruby's hammering coincided with a warning cry from the lookout, signaling the ship's sudden appearance. The crew's frantic movements added to the air of mystery and urgency surrounding the unfolding events.|"[""1.

The event reinforced the engineer's belief in the utility of the two large bells for the lighthouse in foggy weather. Ruby hurried to deliver the letters, knowing the _Smeaton_ might struggle in fog. The engineer allowed Ruby to visit town but return promptly. As the wind picked up, they sailed towards Arbroath. Suddenly, they heard oars and saw a ship's gig approaching. The gig contained navy men, likely a press-gang. Davy and Big Swankie rowed fiercely to evade capture, but the navy crew closed in. Davy, with a family to support, resisted fiercely. The impress service was active due to the war, requiring protection for the lighthouse workers. Each worker had a unique ticket and silver medal. Ruby noticed the officer in the gig, who seemed familiar.|"[""1.

Upon landing, Davy urgently instructed Spink to deliver a message to Mrs. Brand's cottage, explaining his sudden departure. Davy then attempted to row his boat towards the gig, but his efforts were futile as he was left far behind. Ruby, seated in the bow of the gig, faced the sea in silence until they approached what seemed like a massive mountain emerging from the mist, which turned out to be a British man-of-war. Ruby was warmly welcomed by his future shipmates and given free time by the compassionate commander. Meanwhile, at the humble cottage, Janet consoled Davy, acknowledging the negative influence of a past acquaintance. Spink relayed the events to his wife, and they pondered the situation together. Amidst these conversations, the young girl entered with soup, prompting Janet to express concern for Ruby and Minnie Gray.

The sun beamed brightly the next morning over the sea. Its powerful rays seemed to disperse the storm clouds, like defeated bullies retreating. The storm had passed, leaving behind a refreshing breeze and a majestic display of waves crashing against the Bell Rock Lighthouse. Ruby woke up in the library to the dazzling sunlight filtering through the small windows. This was his second awakening of the night, the first being startled by the loud machinery noise. Ruby smiled at his own fright, then fell back asleep instantly. The only sound was the roar of the breakers against the lighthouse.

Looking out of the window, he remembered all the moments shared with Minnie from their first meeting to their last goodbye. One sweet memory was Minnie comforting his mother with words from the Bible. He sighed and continued getting ready. Looking out the southern window, he saw the rocks emerging from the water, signaling it was safe to go down. The library was a cozy room with elegant furniture, a Turkey carpet, and an oak table. The ceiling was painted with stucco panelling, and a marble bust of Robert Stevenson decorated the room. He descended the stairs to the sleeping berths and found his companions sleeping soundly. They talked about their life at the lighthouse, the challenges of cooking with limited ingredients, and the need for exercise. After a walk on the uncovered rock, they returned for a hearty breakfast of cold boiled beef, broiled cod, tea, and buttered toast.|"[""1.

Jamie Dove swiftly grabbed the teapot as if it were a heavy hammer. In an instant, tea gushed out like a burst dam, filling the cup and saucer. The lighthouse had a signal ball on top, raised every morning to show all was well. If not answered by a signal from Arbroath, where the keepers' families stayed, a boat would be sent to check on them. Ruby was advised to wait for the relief boat, which was due soon. They explored the rock, reminiscing about past events. After the tide rose, they returned to the lighthouse. During foggy days, the fog bells rang to warn ships. That night, Ruby was called to the lantern to help catch dinner and was surprised by an owl at the window.|"['1.

Ruby, now free from the owl's gaze, noticed numerous birds circling the lantern outside. Forsyth explained that the birds often seek refuge in the light during foggy weather after getting lost at sea. Dumsby then went out to gather birds for dinner. He skillfully caught them when the light's focus dazzled them. Ruby found it cruel but understood their fate. Later, the fog lifted, and the bells ceased. However, they resumed, disturbing Ruby's sleep. The noise first felt solemn, then irritating, and finally maddening. Restless, he dreamt of smashing anvils and fighting off attackers.

Once again, Ruby found himself in a dream. This time, he was on his way to a church, dressed in his best suit, accompanied by Minnie, who was wearing a beautiful white dress symbolizing her pure spirit. Surrounded by friends in festive attire, they all entered the church, where the wedding bells chimed loudly. Despite being Presbyterian, Ruby accepted the church setting for his wedding with an open mind. As they gathered in front of the pulpit, the clergyman, a solemn figure, began the ceremony. Ruby was puzzled by the location but remained humble in his ignorance. Amidst the sound of the bells and Minnie's presence, Ruby's thoughts drifted away, and the scene changed. The dream transitioned to Ned O'Connor at the signal tower, observing a discrepancy through his telescope at the Bell Rock lighthouse. Ned contemplated the situation, determined to resolve the mystery the following day.|"[""1.
