"In his motor-boat, Tom raced against Andy Foger, a wealthy but mean boy from Shopton. Andy, with his red hair and squinty eyes, often caused trouble for Tom, especially after losing to him in boat races. During a trip on his boat, Arrow, Tom met John Sharp, an experienced balloonist. They rescued Mr. Sharp from a burning balloon over Lake Carlopa. In another adventure, detailed in ""Tom Swift and His Airship,"" Tom, Mr. Sharp, and Mr. Damon faced danger during a pleasure trip in the air. They narrowly escaped being mistaken for bank robbers due to Andy Foger's false accusations. Tom, along with his friends, eventually captured the real robbers and cleared their names.

Not long ago, Tom and Mr. Sharp visited the shed where the innovative submarine, the Advance, was being prepared for launching. This cutting-edge vessel, designed by Mr. Swift and Tom, was unlike any other. Shaped like a cigar, it boasted compartments that could withstand flooding, ensuring the ship's usability even if sections were submerged. The submarine utilized compressed air tanks for buoyancy and had a unique emergency system involving a collapsible aluminum container filled with potent gas to resurface the vessel if stranded underwater. The craft's engine room was centrally located for stability, allowing a single engine to power both propellers and electrical plates for forward and rear movement. The submarine's propulsion system harnessed the power of electricity, with forward and aft plates charged with negative and positive electricity respectively to pull and push the vessel through water. This groundbreaking design also featured traditional propellers as a backup. The submarine was equipped with gasolene motors, dynamos, and pumps for air and water, making it a marvel of engineering.|"['1.

The submarine, named the Advance, was equipped with various compartments and features to accommodate the travelers. Forward from the engine-room was a cabin for dining and daytime activities, along with a small kitchen. The sleeping quarters and storerooms were located back of the engine-room. The submarine was steered from the forward compartment, where levers, wheels, and valves controlled the machinery. Dials displayed the direction, depth, speed, and ocean pressure. A conning tower at the top front held steering apparatus for surface navigation. To exit underwater, diving suits with portable oxygen tanks were used. Bull's-eye windows allowed viewing outside, and defensive features included a steel ram and electrical guns. The Advance was well-stocked with water, air, and provisions for a month's stay below the surface. The craft was designed to withstand intense ocean pressures up to a depth of three miles.|"['1.

One evening, Tom found himself alone in the shop, with the ship needing final adjustments for the sea. As he checked the water tank valves, a strange noise caught his attention. Suddenly, he realized he was trapped in the water compartment. The emergency outlet had closed, leaving him stranded. With no one around to hear his cries for help, Tom knew he had to act fast to escape. Desperately trying to open the steel plate blocking his way, he felt the air growing thin. Feeling defeated, Tom reflected on the situation, realizing that his past actions may have led to his current predicament. Now, he had to figure out a way to free himself before it was too late.|"[""1.

Tom was shocked to realize that Andy Foger had sneaked in and tampered with the gear, trapping him inside the water-ballast tank of the submarine. Tom pondered how Andy had located him and managed to operate the mechanism. He suspected Andy's familiarity with similar machinery at the bank where his father worked. Despite his frustration, Tom knew trying to break out was futile. He attempted to work the gear from inside but quickly realized it was impossible. With no one around to hear his cries for help, Tom knew he had to wait for someone to come and free him.

Once more, Tom attempted to push the steel door back, but his efforts were in vain. He called out until he grew tired, but no one responded. He thought he heard footsteps in the shed, hoping it was Andy, but knew the bully wouldn't return. Andy didn't realize the danger he put Tom in by sealing the airtight tank. Tom, feeling the air grow thin, found a monkey wrench. With renewed hope, he lit his lantern and tried to loosen bolts to open the door, but it was futile. Tom then decided to signal for help by banging the wrench on the tank walls, using a code he and Mr. Sharp had created for the airship. By tapping out the code for help, Tom hoped someone would hear and rescue him.|"[""1.

Tom remembered the moment he stopped hammering and started tapping out a pattern of seven blows repeatedly, signaling for help. Exhausted and aching, he continued sending signals from the tank, hoping someone would hear. Eventually, Mr. Sharp returned early and recognized the distress signal. Tom was found in the workshop, weak but safe. Mrs. Baggert brewed tea, regretful for not understanding the signal earlier. Tom recovered quickly and resumed work on the submarine with his father and Mr. Sharp. Plans for the trial were postponed, but a new project was on the horizon. Mr. Berg invited Tom for an auto trip, replacing a companion named Roger or Moger who had left unexpectedly.|"['1.

Mr. Berg was surprised by Andy's actions. Andy, the son of a director at Mr. Berg's firm, unexpectedly visited a seaside hotel where Mr. Berg was staying. Andy vanished after inquiring about a rival submarine being built. Tom, busy preparing a submarine for a trial, suspected Andy left hastily upon hearing a doctor was called for Tom.

Tom pondered the situation. He decided to be extra cautious, especially with Mr. Berg and Andy Foger. Tom was determined to make Andy regret locking him up. He hinted to Mr. Berg that their plans would surprise him. Tom and Mr. Sharp planned to keep their voyage for the sunken treasure a secret. They were busy preparing the submarine and gathering information about the treasure ship discreetly. Mr. Sharp revealed they were in contact with Captain Alden Weston, a seasoned sailor with experience worldwide. The treasure ship was lost near Uruguay, and they aimed to gather more details once they arrived. Mr. Sharp intended to reveal their plan to Captain Weston just before the voyage to avoid any last-minute changes. Unexpectedly, they realized they needed tools from Shopton, where Eradicate Sampson was overseeing things in their absence.|"['1.

Tom and Mr. Sharp were accustomed to flying in the airship, attracting attention wherever they went. They readied the Red Cloud for a flight above the shop with the submarine. Eradicate, a skilled cook, prepared a meal. While Mr. Sharp packed tools for the return, Tom decided to stroll into Shopton to find his friend, Ned Newton. On his way, a car splashed muddy water on Tom, only to be helped by Ned later. Tom, still upset, planned revenge on Andy. The next morning, they prepared for the return trip. Spotting a car below, Mr. Sharp devised a plan. Tom was to drop an anchor onto the car, unseen. This would lead to an exciting turn of events.|"['1.

Tom followed instructions carefully and lowered the rope with the grapple from the airship. The engine ran quietly to avoid alerting three cronies in a speeding car below. The Red Cloud moved in the same direction as the automobile. Tom then raised the airship while pulling the car backward by reversing the engine. Startled, Andy and his friends noticed the airship above with a rope attached to their car. Tom called for them to cut the rope, causing the car's rear wheels to drop with a loud crash. The tires burst, leaving Andy's car disabled. Tom and his friend continued their journey to the coast, leaving Andy and his friends to deal with the consequences.

Tom and Mr. Damon were discussing a thrilling adventure involving sunken treasure worth three hundred thousand dollars in gold bullion aboard a ship off the coast of Uruguay. Tom and his father planned to recover the treasure using their submarine. Excited by the idea, Mr. Damon eagerly agreed to join the expedition. As they approached the city, they walked along the road near the beach, discussing the treasure and their upcoming submarine mission. Suddenly, two men emerged from behind a sand dune, catching Tom's attention. To his surprise, one of the men turned out to be Addison Berg, an agent for a rival submarine boat building firm.

While Tom and Mr. Damon proceeded to Atlantis for oil, Mr. Berg and his companion rushed back along the path by the sand dunes. Mr. Maxwell questioned, ""Why the rush?"" ""You turned abruptly when you saw that man and boy. There was no apparent reason for such haste. They seemed to be discussing a submarine. You're in the same field. You could be allies.""

Mr. Damon split his time among different areas of the submarine, blessing parts of himself, his clothes, and the ship. Eventually, he settled in the main living area to gaze out of the large windows. The submarine continued its journey smoothly, responding well to commands. Tom occasionally steered it up to the surface and back down, performing like a playful porpoise. Captain Weston guided Tom, ensuring they avoided collisions. The craft traveled straight ahead for an hour, reaching a depth of 5,700 feet, about a mile below the ocean's surface. The submarine's triple hull and special material held up against the intense pressure. After inspecting the hull, they used the searchlight to observe the ocean bed teeming with crabs and lobsters.

With fierce determination, the crew worked tirelessly to repair the machinery of the submarine, knowing their lives depended on it. Trapped on the ocean's bed, they were running out of oxygen and facing the imminent threat of death. The pressure of the water outside was too great to risk leaving the protection of the craft, and their diving suits were not an option. As the air grew increasingly foul, they struggled to breathe and work. Mr. Damon's plea for fresh air echoed their desperation. Despite the suffocating atmosphere, Tom and the others persevered.

"""Everyone on board!"" commanded Mr. Swift, leading them into the submarine. Tom and his father, along with Captain Weston, stayed in the conning tower. As the signal was given, electricity surged through the plates, propelling the Advance forward on the surface. Speeding through the water, they set out to retrieve gold from a sunken wreck, but enemies were already pursuing them. ""Let's alter our plans,"" said Mr. Swift. ""Instead of staying on the surface, we'll submerge. Let them get closer to witness our move."" The inventor signaled to stop, halting the submarine. He then initiated the descent, surprising their pursuers. Lowering to about two hundred feet, Mr. Swift handed control to Tom and Captain Weston.

Tom advised waiting until the end of the trip. He mentioned that many things could happen in a submarine similar to those in a car. The night went well, and the ship progressed smoothly. The next morning, they surfaced to confirm their location and get fresh air. They tested new diving suits made of a strong metal for deep-sea exploration. Tom, Mr. Sharp, and Captain Weston tested the suits while the others stayed on the ship. They walked on the ocean floor, encountering fish and sea creatures. The experience was novel, with the divers enjoying the underwater walk. Tom found part of a wrecked vessel buried in the sand. While navigating, they avoided coral reefs and observed various marine life. They also spotted a small tropical island that was not on the charts, hoping to find fresh water and fruit there.|['1.

On the submarine's deck, a small electric boat for six was stored in a pocket. Easily launched without davits, it floated with Mr. Sharp's help. Fully charged, they headed to shore at sunset. Finding a spring and coconuts but no oranges, they enjoyed the coconut milk. The island, tropical and unvisited, teemed with birds. Tom suggested exploring it the next day, agreed by his father. Back in the submarine, they discussed their journey. Suddenly, they spotted another submarine nearby, similar to theirs. It was Addison Berg's, who taunted them. Tom was shocked, fearing their rivals were following. Berg claimed they abandoned the government prize for a new venture and boasted about their submarine.|"['1.

The Wonder had relinquished the battle temporarily, lacking a defense against the enemy's attack. Tom quickly informed his father of the situation. Together, they emerged from the conning tower onto the deck. The rival ship, with Berg and his crew, was close by. Tom suggested a plan to escape and reach the sunken treasure ahead of their opponents. As they submerged, the Advance disappeared from sight, leaving Berg and his crew behind. Captain Weston assured them of their safety, as the rival ship had to make repairs, giving them a significant advantage. Tom missed the view from the airship but appreciated the underwater journey.

Tom realized he had to act quickly. He rushed forward and removed all the electric wires to free Mr. Sharp's hands, which were stuck due to the strong magnetic force. Luckily, the electricity was low voltage, so Mr. Sharp didn't get burned. With the help of Captain Weston and Mr. Damon, Tom moved his father to safety. Turning on the electric current, he activated the pumps, causing the submarine to rise. As they resurfaced, they saw a Brazilian warship nearby.

The captain and his crew found themselves in a perilous situation as they were suddenly captured by officers and crew members from the Brazilian warship, San Paulo. Despite Captain Weston's display of strength by throwing a sailor overboard, they were outnumbered and overpowered. The captain's initial anger subsided into a steely determination as they were ordered onto the San Paulo for a court-martial. The sailors were on high alert, knowing the captain's fighting spirit. The admiral, Fanchetti, was wary of the adventurers and ordered them to be closely guarded, suspecting an escape plan. Captain Weston, analyzing the situation, realized the admiral's motives in seeking glory through capturing their submarine.

Captain Weston and his crew found themselves in a dire situation as they were accused of a serious offense by Admiral Fanchetti and faced a grave consequence. Despite their protests and explanations, the admiral was convinced of their guilt. The crew was found guilty by the court-martial and sentenced to be executed by a firing squad at sunrise in three days. The admiral deemed them as pirates due to the presence of torpedo tubes on their submarine and their unauthorized entry into the harbor. The crew's pleas fell on deaf ears, and they were swiftly taken away. The future looked bleak for Captain Weston and his friends as they awaited their fate.|"['1.

Protests were useless, and struggling was in vain. The prisoners were led onto the deck, grateful for the fresh air. The interior of the ship was hot and stuffy, as the weather was unpleasant. They were instructed to stay within a certain area on deck, guarded by armed sailors. Looking out, they could see their submarine floating in the bay, surrounded by Brazilian boats. The captain hoped it was a bluff, meant to intimidate them into giving up the submarine. The day had been a whirlwind, with events unfolding rapidly since Mr. Swift's injury. As they observed the island and the boats coming and going, the captain suggested it might be better for the submarine to stay there than fall into the wrong hands. Later, sailors brought food for the prisoners, who were sitting under an awning to escape the scorching sun. Captain Weston vowed to escape the guards once they were aboard the Advance. Despite being allowed some freedom, they were closely watched. As night fell, they hoped for a chance to break free but were locked in a cabin below deck. Attempts to pick the lock failed, as the guards were alert. The next morning, they were back on deck, relieved to be out of the stifling cabin.|['1.

The prisoners were praised for their boat-building skills, but their craft was confiscated by the government. Lieutenant Drascalo conducted a mock execution to instill fear, making Tom and his friends realize the severity of their situation. The scorching heat and eerie stillness hinted at an impending storm. As preparations were made on the ship, Captain Weston warned of the dangerous weather. Suddenly, chaos erupted as an anchor was dropped, and a mast broke loose. Amidst the storm, the prisoners seized an opportunity to escape to the deck.

Tom and his brave friends were in a fierce battle on the San Paulo ship. Despite the danger, they fought off the Brazilian sailors who tried to capture them. The Americans showed great courage and skill, causing the attackers to retreat. Amidst the chaos, a strong wind caused the ship to tilt, leading to a collision with a deck house. In the midst of the storm, Tom and his companions managed to escape to their submarine. Lieutenant Drascalo tried to stop them by firing a carbine, narrowly missing Tom's head. Despite the rough sea, Captain Weston expertly navigated the small boat to reach the safety of their submarine.

In the midst of a storm with thunder and lightning, the submarine started to sink. Tom, in the conning tower, spotted the San Paulo drifting closer under the strong wind. With a bright flash, he saw Admiral Fanchetti and Lieutenant Drascalo on the warship, gazing at the Advance. As the submarine descended below the sea's surface, it was tossed until it reached a safe depth. Tom signaled Mr. Sharp in the engine room, and the Advance swiftly moved away from the island and the hostile vessel. Captain Weston noted the careless sailors leaving equipment behind. After inspecting the submarine for damage caused by the intruders, they continued their journey towards the sunken treasure, far from the storm's reach.|"[""1.

Captain Weston confirmed that it was indeed the Boldero wreck. Despite the challenging depth of over two miles and a half, they prepared to venture out in diving suits to explore. The submarine settled on the ocean bed, facing the shadowy wreck. The crew was more concerned about retrieving the gold than the deep-water sharks lurking nearby. The captain and the young inventor quickly donned their diving suits, equipped with metal bars for protection. After adjusting to the intense water pressure, they ventured out with the aid of helmet lights. Despite finding cracks in the wreck, they were unable to pry them open. The captain signaled to Tom, indicating their next move, but Tom couldn't decipher the gestures.|"['1.

They searched for a way to reach the Boldero's decks, but found none. It was like climbing a smooth steel wall. The sailor made gestures, puzzling the boy. As they circled the wreck, they saw no way to access the gold. Passing the bow, they spotted a submarine nearby. Suddenly, a shark lunged at the captain. Tom, alarmed, tried to warn, but the sound was trapped in his helmet. The sailor defended with a bar, but missed. Tom acted swiftly, stabbing the shark. The sea turned red as the shark attacked. Tom and the captain faced a horde of sharks. They sought refuge under the wreck's bow, but the sharks closed in. The situation was dire as the sharks circled, posing a grave threat.|"[""1.

"At that instant, a commotion was noticed aboard the submarine. Tom spotted his father peering from the conning tower, signaling with gestures. Tom soon realized that Mr. Swift was instructing him and Captain Weston to hunker down. Following his father's lead, Tom pulled the captain down with him. Suddenly, the front electric gun extended and targeted the group of sharks, mainly gathered around the deceased one. A volley of small projectiles was fired into the midst of the creatures from the electric cannon. The water turned crimson once more, and the surviving sharks swiftly swam away. Tom and Captain Weston were rescued. They quickly reentered the submarine, recounting their gripping encounter. ""I believe the sharks have been deterred far from here now,"" remarked the captain. The crew attempted to lower the submarine onto the wreck to avoid damaging it, but strong currents thwarted their efforts. Equipped with a sharp steel ram, the submarine was ideal for the task. After ensuring the craft's machinery was in top condition, the crew decided to rest for the night and resume their mission in the morning.

Once again, the large steel ram struck the side of the Boldero, causing the submarine to shake. A hole was created big enough for someone to enter and place dynamite to break up the wreck. Tom and the captain set the explosives and moved the Advance to a safe distance. After a dull rumble and murky water, the wreck was effectively broken into two parts. Tom, the captain, Mr. Sharp, and Mr. Damon donned diving suits to explore. As they approached the wreck, they kept an eye out for sharks. Tom was the first to climb aboard the disrupted steamer, followed by Captain Weston. Inside the captain's cabin, they found a small safe left unlocked. Behind it, they discovered a secret compartment filled with boxes. They were all curious about what the boxes contained but remained speechless in their excitement.
