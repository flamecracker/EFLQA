Once upon a time, on Christmas Eve, old Scrooge sat in his office. The weather was cold and foggy, making the city dark. The clock had just struck three, but it was already dark outside. The fog was so thick that the houses across the street looked like ghosts. Scrooge's clerk worked in a small, cold room copying letters. Scrooge had a small fire, but the clerk's fire was even smaller. Scrooge wouldn't let him add more coal, predicting they would have to part ways. The clerk tried to warm himself at the candle, but failed. Scrooge's door was open so he could watch his clerk. Scrooge didn't care for Christmas and thought it was a time of foolishness. His nephew tried to convince him of the good in Christmas, but Scrooge remained stubborn and refused to change his mind.|"['1.

Scrooge's nephew left without a word, greeting the clerk warmly. Two gentlemen entered, asking for help for the poor. Scrooge refused, saying he supports workhouses. The men left, and Scrooge continued working. Outside, the fog thickened, and people lit fires to keep warm. The shops looked festive. The Lord Mayor prepared for Christmas. The cold was intense. If St. Dunstan had nipped the Evil Spirit's nose, it would have been better. A carol was sung at Scrooge's door. Finally, it was time to close the office. Reluctantly, Scrooge left as the clerk extinguished the candle.|"['1.

Scrooge grumbled about Christmas as he left his office, instructing his clerk to arrive early the next day. The clerk hurried home to play games, while Scrooge had a solitary dinner and read. Returning to his dark, dreary chambers, Scrooge noticed an unusual change in the knocker on his door - it now resembled the face of his deceased partner, Marley. Despite feeling a sense of dread, he dismissed it as his imagination. The loud slam of the door echoed through the empty house as he cautiously made his way upstairs, lighting a candle. Scrooge hesitated, half-expecting Marley's ghostly presence, but found nothing amiss and scoffed at his own fears before continuing his journey through the eerie building.|"['1.

Scrooge climbed up the stairs without a care, finding comfort in the darkness. He checked his rooms, ensuring all was in order. Satisfied, he settled by the fire for gruel. The room's Dutch-tiled fireplace depicted biblical scenes, but Marley's face haunted his thoughts. As he pondered, a disused bell rang, followed by a chain's clanking. Suddenly, a ghostly figure entered, causing the flames to flicker. The apparition was unmistakable – Marley's Ghost.|"['1.

The same face looked back at Scrooge, it was Marley with his distinct pigtail, waistcoat, tights, and boots. The chain wrapped around him like a tail, made of cash-boxes, keys, and ledgers. His transparent body revealed the buttons on his coat. Scrooge, though observing closely, remained incredulous. The Ghost sat down, and Scrooge, trying to distract himself, joked that the ghost might be a bit of beef or mustard. The spectre's voice shook Scrooge to the core. The Ghost then removed its bandage, revealing a ghastly sight. It explained that spirits must wander after death if they fail to do so in life. The Ghost bore the heavy chain it created in life. It warned Scrooge of the consequences of his own actions.|"[""**1.

Scrooge had a habit of putting his hands in his pockets when he thought deeply. Reflecting on the Ghost's words, he stayed on his knees, not looking up. The apparition lamented its past, regretting not using its time wisely. It emphasized the importance of kindness and charity. The specter warned Scrooge of more visits and vanished.

Scrooge shut the window and checked the door the Ghost had used. It was securely locked. He tried to say 'Humbug!' but couldn't. Exhausted, he went to bed without changing, quickly falling asleep. Upon waking, it was so dark he could barely see. The nearby church bell chimed, but instead of the correct time, it struck twelve. Thinking the clock was wrong, he got up to look out the window. It was foggy and cold, but no sign of people. Relieved, he went back to bed. However, thoughts of Marley's Ghost troubled him, making him wonder if it was real. As the bell tolled one, he resolved to stay awake. Suddenly, the curtains were drawn, revealing an otherworldly visitor, resembling a child and an old man, radiating light.|"['1.

Even this, however, when Scrooge gazed at it steadily, was not its most peculiar feature. The figure's appearance shifted, with parts dissolving into the gloom, sometimes with one arm, other times with multiple legs or no head. Despite this, the figure would regain clarity. The Ghost questioned Scrooge's readiness to extinguish the light it provided. Ignoring Scrooge's excuses about the cold and his attire, the Spirit led him through a wall to a snowy countryside. The city had disappeared, leaving a serene winter landscape. The Spirit's touch lingered, evoking a flood of memories and emotions. They strolled down the road, passing familiar landmarks until they reached a market-town. Scrooge joyfully recognized the townsfolk, feeling a newfound warmth as they exchanged Christmas greetings. They approached a dilapidated mansion, a stark contrast to its former grandeur, evoking a sense of neglect and desolation.|"['1.

The Ghost and Scrooge crossed the hall to a door at the back of the house. It opened to a long, empty room with plain desks. A lonely boy read by a weak fire. Scrooge sat and wept at the sight of his forgotten self. Every sound in the house, from mice to dripping water, softened Scrooge's heart. The Spirit pointed to his younger self reading. Suddenly, a man in foreign clothes stood outside, leading an ass with wood. Scrooge recognized him as Ali Baba. Scrooge reminisced about past Christmases, mentioning Valentine, Orson, and the Sultan's Groom. Scrooge's emotional outburst surprised his business friends.

Scrooge's past self grew larger at the words, and the room became darker and dirtier. The panels shrank, the windows cracked, plaster fell from the ceiling, and the laths were exposed. Scrooge didn't know how this happened. He only knew it was correct. He found himself alone again when the other boys had gone home for the holidays. The child was full of joy, saying they were going home for good. The child's father had become kinder, making home feel like heaven. They were to spend Christmas together and have the best time. The child dragged Scrooge towards the door, eager to leave. A voice called for Scrooge's box, and the schoolmaster appeared, shaking hands with Scrooge.

At eleven o'clock, the lively Christmas party at the Fezziwig's home came to an end. Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig stood by the door, bidding farewell to each guest with warm wishes for the holiday season.
