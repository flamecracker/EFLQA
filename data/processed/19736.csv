"With joyous shouts, the twins dashed to the lake's edge where their homemade raft, nicknamed the ""steamboat"" by Russ, was tethered to an old stump. Russ and Tom Hardy, the hired hand, had crafted the raft, providing the children with endless amusement. ""All aboard!"" exclaimed Russ, prompting Laddie and Violet to embark. Meanwhile, Mother Bunker and Grandma Bell settled in the shade to observe. Mun Bun and Margy scampered to a nearby hill, rolling down the slope gleefully. Russ steered the raft around Lake Sagatook, ensuring it accommodated the twins' size. The children engaged in imaginative play, mimicking steamboat sounds. As the raft glided across the cove, Rose joined in, assisting with a pole. Mrs. Bunker trailed after the youngsters, curious about a mysterious voice calling out to them."|"['1.

"""Daddy"" Bunker, also known as Charles, had a real estate and lumber office in Pineville, Pennsylvania, by the Rainbow River. Pineville housed around twenty thousand residents and was a charming town. The Bunker family resided on the main street, less than a mile from Daddy Bunker's office. Apart from the Bunkers, the household included Norah O'Grady, the friendly Irish cook, and Jerry Simms, a former soldier who helped with odd jobs and driving the automobile. The Bunkers had various relatives, such as Grandma Bell in Maine near Lake Sagatook, and Grandpa Ford in Tarrington, New York. Additionally, there were Aunt Jo in Boston, Uncle Frederick Bell in Moon City, Montana, and Cousin Tom Bunker in Seaview, New Jersey. After a delightful visit to Grandma Bell, the Bunkers bid farewell and embarked on a journey to Aunt Jo's, unaware of the adventures awaiting them."|"['1.

"""Oh, yes, lots of fun,"" his father replied. ""Aunt Jo wouldn't ask us to spend two weeks or more at her house, if she didn't know you children could have fun, even if she does live in a city. Don't worry about that--you'll have fun.""

""But we can't have a boat,"" sighed Rose. She and the other children loved the water, and, living so near Rainbow River as they did, they were used to paddling about, playing with make-believe boats and toys like that.

Rose had quite a large doll, her best one, which she carried with her in her arms whenever the family went traveling. Rose had brought her doll to Grandma Bell's and something funny had happened to the doll in the sleeping-car. You may read about it in the book before this one."|"['1.

"""She's probably watching the men load the steamer,"" he said. Boxes and barrels were being loaded into the ship's hold. Margy might be watching from the upper deck. Mrs. Bunker searched for her daughter among the tired children boarding the steamer. Russ and his father inquired about Margy's whereabouts. They were directed to a stateroom where Margy was found sleeping with a white poodle dog. Relieved, the Bunkers were reunited. The steamer journeyed through the night, reaching Boston the next day. Margy had followed the poodle into a stateroom where she fell asleep. Mr. Bunker retrieved her from there.

"""One, two, three, four, five, six!"" she counted, pointing her finger, first at Russ, as he was the oldest, and ending with Mun Bun, who was the youngest. ""All here! And I'm _so_ glad to see you,"" she went on.

""I can sleep with the dog if you haven't got room for me anywhere else,"" said Margy, as she went up to Alexis, which was the dog's name. ""I did sleep with a dog on the boat, and he did love me and I did love him.""

""But come in and get your things off,"" went on Aunt Jo. ""I'm keeping you standing in the hall as if I didn't have room for you inside. Come in, make yourselves at home and I'll have Parker hurry the lunch. You must be starved.""

""This is it,"" said Laddie. ""I didn't make it up, but I asked one of the sailors on the steamer for a good riddle, and he told me this one. It's, 'What can you put in your left hand that you can't put in your right hand?' That's the riddle.""

Mun Bun and Margy managed to coax the large dog, Alexis, into the bathtub. It seemed like Alexis might have done this before. As the dog stood in the tub, Margy and Mun Bun tugged at the chain handle that controlled the shower. Margy had her hands on the handle, pulling, while Mun Bun tried to take over. Their efforts caused water to spray out from the shower overhead, splashing onto Alexis, who seemed to enjoy it. The children's father intervened, commanding them to stop, and called Alexis out of the tub. The dog shook off the water, splashing everyone. Aunt Jo reassured them that it was okay and mentioned that Alexis usually gets bathed in the garage. She also suggested fun activities in the city, like visiting Bunker Hill Monument and Nantasket Beach. Russ, who enjoyed making things, pondered on finding a new project. The children then divided their time between playing with the hose and sand.|['1.

When they reached Aunt Jo's house, Mrs. Bunker showed the wallet to her husband. He counted the money inside.

Aunt Jo explained the importance of having identification in your wallet. She shared that she always carries a slip with her name and address in case she loses her wallet. Mr. Bunker discovered a torn letter in the lost pocketbook with a heartwarming message from a person to their mother, signed by Uncle Jack. However, the torn letter made it challenging to identify the owner. They decided to put an advertisement in the paper about the found pocketbook and check the 'lost and found' section. Meanwhile, Aunt Jo answered a call from Mr. North, who mentioned something found but nothing lost. Aunt Jo checked if all the six little Bunkers were present before continuing the conversation.|"['1.

"""No, it was nothing like that,"" responded her aunt. ""The gentleman who called was Mr. North, my neighbor. He mentioned he found something that belongs to one of you. Did any of you leave out your toys in the yard?"" Russ and his siblings couldn't recall anything missing. Soon, the doorbell rang, and Mr. North arrived with what appeared to be a bundle of rags. ""Oh, it's my doll Sue!"" exclaimed Rose. ""I left her to sunbathe on the porch and forgot."" Mr. North returned Sue, explaining the mix-up.

The six little Bunkers were left to play on their own, having a great time riding toys around Aunt Jo's house. They laughed and shouted, enjoying themselves on the stone walkway. Parker or William or Anne would occasionally check on them to ensure they were safe. The children even tried to make a harness for their dog, Alexis, to pull them in an express wagon. However, Alexis ended up dragging the broken harness away, leaving the kids stranded. Undeterred, Russ and Laddie decided to create a makeshift fountain by digging a hole and using a hose. Even though it made them tired, they were excited to wade in the water. If William had noticed, he might have stopped them, but he was occupied in the garage, unaware of the boys' activities.|"[""1.

Russ and his brother faced a challenge while setting up a fountain using a hose. They ingeniously decided to drive a stick into the hole and attach the hose to it to create a water fountain. However, their plan went awry when the chauffeur, William, accidentally turned on the water, causing a fountain that soaked him. Despite their best efforts, they couldn't stop the water flow until William intervened, explaining that the garden shouldn't have a fountain. As they tried to shut off the water, a little dog ran into the muddy water, splashing the boys.

The small dog continued to splash in the puddle, but the large dog, Alexis, made a grand entrance with a big splash as he jumped in. The Great Dane, Aunt Jo's dog, ran through the water, creating even more splashes. The chauffeur explained that the dogs were friends and often played together, but this muddy escapade was a first. As the summer passed, the children enjoyed various activities, including exploring Boston and watching airships. Rose, intrigued by the balloons, decided to experiment with them by attaching several together to see how much they could lift.

Rose was playing with her doll Lily and some balloons when a big dog named Alexis came bounding towards her. Startled by the dog's playful behavior, Rose accidentally let go of the string holding Lily's basket. The balloons lifted the basket into the air like an airship, carrying Lily away. Rose tried to grab the balloons, but it was too late. Aunt Jo came by and asked if Alexis had hurt her, but Rose explained what had happened. The other Bunker children felt sad about losing the balloons, especially Margy and Mun Bun, who cried. Russ comforted Rose and promised to help.

Aunt Jo explained to Rose that the balloons she released might not be found as they could burn out and descend. During an automobile ride, they searched for the balloons but couldn't locate them. Meanwhile, Vi got lost on her way back from the store, holding a loaf of bread. She wandered the streets, feeling lost and helpless. Unable to recognize any familiar faces or houses, Vi felt lost and started to cry. A kind girl approached her, offering help.

"Aunt Jo rushed downstairs and peered up the dumbwaiter shaft. She spotted the box-like waiter stuck midway but couldn't see Margy inside. A dumbwaiter acts like a small elevator, usually for moving items between rooms without using stairs. ""I know what's wrong,"" Aunt Jo said, examining the shaft once more. ""Margy's foot is blocking the box, preventing it from moving up and down."" With gentle nudges from the parasol, Aunt Jo freed Margy's foot, allowing the dumbwaiter, an open box, to slide down on a rope over a pulley-wheel, rescuing Margy. She had been scared and in tears but felt safe in her mother's arms. Margy had climbed into the dumbwaiter from a chair in the kitchen, seeking a ride like the soap she placed inside earlier.

Nobody had ever tied a tin can to Alexis' tail. He was too big for that. Around Aunt Jo's house, Alexis pulled the six little Bunkers in a wagon, having fun. One day, a ragman's wagon stopped, and Mun Bun climbed up, pretending to drive the horse. The junkman's horse went slowly, giving Mun Bun a safe ride. Mun Bun enjoyed his adventure, driving the horse all by himself while the others were occupied. It was a delightful experience for Mun Bun, even though he thought he might have had more fun at Grandma Bell's.

The six little Bunkers always promised not to repeat their mischievous deeds, but they always ended up doing something else they were told not to. One day, while playing in the yard, the children saw a man with gold rings in his ears pushing a cart that whistled like a teakettle. Mun Bun thought it was a peanut roaster, just like the one near Daddy's office. The man stopped in front of Aunt Jo's house, still smiling as the peanut-roaster whistled. Daddy Bunker explained that the steam made the whistling sound, and the Italian man put water in to prevent the peanuts from burning. Aunt Jo shared stories of tame squirrels in the park, but Laddie surprised everyone by revealing a live squirrel he had brought home with peanuts.|"['1.

But soon, the sound of a hand-organ made the monkey alert. The Italian hand-organ man, Petro, appeared calling out for his beloved monkey.

Despite Rose's reluctance to share her skate, Mrs. Bunker encouraged her to let the boys create a skatemobile for fun.

The little dog was safe behind his fence, looking out and barking. He had been knocked about but not hurt much, just a bit bruised and mussed up. After a warm water wash, Rose, her brothers, and sometimes Violet had fun on the skatemobile, riding down the hill steering better when going fast. Mun Bun and Margy joined after playing in the sand pile, too small to coast alone. The roller-skate wagon was faster than Mun Bun's junk cart. It was early August with plenty of summer left. The weather was hot, but there was shade at Aunt Jo's house. They found a pocketbook, thinking it belonged to a poor woman.

"""No, it's just a kite,"" Russ explained. He, Laddie, and Tom were making kites to fly up high. They skipped the car ride to focus on their kite-making. After Aunt Jo and the others left, Russ and Laddie gathered their supplies and began crafting kites with tails. Russ, experienced in kite-making, taught Laddie. They attached a piece of paper to the kite string, sending it twirling up towards the kite. Russ tied the cord to a heavy stone in the vacant lot. As Russ searched for more string, Laddie watched the kites soar high. Russ struggled to find the right cord but was determined to fly his kite as high as possible. Meanwhile, Laddie helped by winding in the string as the kite started to descend. When the kite dipped too low, Russ tried to pull it back up.

The six little Bunkers, along with Margy carried by her father, headed towards the water. They were near the merry-go-round close to the bathing pavilion where they had left their clothes from their morning swim. At the cashier's desk, a young lady managed tickets and belongings left by swimmers. Seeing Margy with Mr. Bunker, she helped set up a comfortable spot for Margy on a bench. After resting, Margy felt better and sat up. The cashier, who had been kind, checked on Margy's well-being. The other children, having been told Margy was improving, joined to see her. Vi recognized the cashier, Mary, who had helped her find her way home once.

"""Oh no!"" exclaimed Mary, the bathing pavilion cashier. ""I keep people's belongings safe in little compartments called pigeonholes until they return with a check. Each item is stored separately, much like a post office box but larger. Let me show you."" Mary led her companions to the compartments, where valuables like watches and rings were stored in sealed envelopes. ""That doll is mine,"" Mary explained, ""I planned to make a new dress for it today. I used to enjoy playing with dolls and making clothes for them. But this morning, I was busy helping Mr. Barton, the pavilion owner, so I didn't get around to sewing."" Rose, Mary's sister, insisted the doll had a red thread repair from a previous mishap.
