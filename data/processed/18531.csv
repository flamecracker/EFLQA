"Minerva Court was a gloomy place, a narrow strip with a grim atmosphere. It lacked any sense of former grandeur or hope for improvement. Despite its dismal state, it boasted some modern conveniences like corner grocery stores and a basement saloon named ""The Dearest Spot."" A new bar called ""The Oasis"" was being set up by an ambitious local, aiming to quench the thirst of all. Children were often seen scurrying with pitchers of beer, as there were few children in the area. The residents were unkempt, with women gossiping from windows and men smoking on doorsteps. The sidewalks were dirty, and the street resembled a junkyard. The scene was filled with various odors, some waiting to outdo the others.

Everything was set, but Timothy had one more thing to do. A few weeks earlier, a lovely young girl had met him on the street.

Jabe and Miss Vilda drove quietly along the river road by Wilkins's Woods. Jabe mentioned this was a place he had taken Timothy before, a likely path to nearby villages.
