They could climb a wooden fence on the right, run through meadows up to a hawthorn hedge, and then reach the woods with old fir and pine trees. Kurt warned about Mr. Trius beating anyone near the hedge. As they walked, the mother chose the left path for a clear view of the castle.

"""Yes, I see it and I am happy that it is so,"" said Apollonie. ""How could one have suspected that boys who had a good education should want to hurt others without cause? The young Falcon would never have done such a thing, I know that. He only ran into the vegetable garden because his two friends were chasing him from both sides.""

Uncle Philip laughed: ""I am glad you are so just to me, Mrs. Apollonie. Even when you scolded the Falcon properly for tramping down your plants, you knew that it was not in maliciousness he did it but in self-defence. I am afraid it is time to go now"" and with these words he heartily shook his old acquaintance by the hand. The two little ones, who had never left his side, were ready immediately to strike out once more.

They soon reached the hill and the castle, which was bathed in the soft evening light, lay openly before them. A hushed silence reigned about the gray building and the old pine trees under the tower, whose branches lay trailing on the ground. For years no human hand had touched them. Where the blooming garden had been wild bushes and weeds covered the ground.

The kids had scattered in different directions. Bruno was engrossed in a small book far off, while Mea found beautiful forget-me-nots by a gurgling stream. Excited, she darted around to pick them all. Kurt climbed a tree to study the castle closely. Mäzli found strawberries and dragged Lippo to help.

It's unfair to label Loneli as raggedy; few are as genuine and pleasant as Apollonie and her grandchild.""

Meanwhile, Kurt, preoccupied with his own thoughts, missed his favorite dessert at lunch, prompting a reproachful comment from Lippo. Kurt, seeking permission to leave for an important discussion with friends, assured his mother he was doing the right thing. Rushing off to school, Kurt and his classmates sat through a seemingly endless two-hour period before finally setting off in a noisy yet organized procession towards Apollonie's house.

Apollonie opened the window wide and leaned out, thanking the children for defending Loneli. She disappeared briefly but returned with a big basket of apples from the castle garden. Lux recognized them and marveled at how she got them without trouble. Kurt defended Apollonie, mentioning how Mr. Trius likely gave them to her. The children happily devoured the apples and dispersed, thanking her. Kurt rushed home for his homework before the next adventure. Mrs. Knippel arrived, causing Mea and Mäzli to flee.

Mrs. Maxa expressed her regret at hearing about the children's behavior from Mrs. Knippel. She wondered if the child might have unintentionally been impolite. Mrs. Knippel mentioned that while her children hadn't behaved similarly, they all had a tendency to preach, especially Mea. This preaching habit often led to conflicts with friends. Mrs. Maxa learned that the boys would be moving to a new home in town soon, a change she had anticipated. The attorney's wife assured Mrs. Maxa that her husband was arranging everything for the move. Mrs. Maxa was puzzled by the insistence on the boys living together, as they didn't have a close bond. Mrs. Knippel explained that it was a matter of propriety and respect for both families.

A group of children excitedly embarked on an adventure to prove there was no ghost at the castle. Singing loudly to the nonexistent ghost was thrilling for them. As they climbed faster than usual, the moon emerged, illuminating the fields. Upon reaching the castle hill, they entered the dark pinewoods. Mysterious sounds led some children to sneak away. Soon, a tall, eerie figure appeared on the terrace, clad in shining armor. The children froze in fear. Lux dashed off, Clevi stared at the figure, and Kurt, alone, fled down the hill.

Kurt, usually cheerful, was unusually depressed, burdened by a secret he kept from his mother. He felt like a traitor for not confessing what he saw, which led to rumors of a ghost haunting Wildenstein. Only Lippo and Mäzli remained carefree, with Mäzli seeking solace with Apollonie.

"Salo heard his sister's call but couldn't understand more. Miss Remke piled shawls on his arms, making it hard to hold them all. He quickly followed his sister, already at the carriage. Recognizing his sister's signal, he lifted the child in. Seeing the boy next to the carriage, he exclaimed happily, ""You must be young Salo, my father's friend. Let's be friends too."" Salo looked surprised, finding the trip odd. Leonore sat contentedly, as Mrs. Maxa whispered to her. Mrs. Maxa suggested Salo sit with the coachman to see where Leonore was going.

Twice a year, a relative of their great-aunt visited them, but he was so formal and quiet that they didn't enjoy his visits. Despite this, he was the one who made decisions for them. They were to stay put until Salo finished his studies, and then they could choose where to live. When they arrived at Castle Wildenstein, the boy's companion replied shortly, observing the young Baron's innocent admiration for the castle. Upon reaching Mrs. Maxa's house, the children were still at school, and Kathy ran out, bewildered. Salo found himself holding the reins, and his new friend swiftly took charge, ensuring the horses stayed calm. He helped Leonore into her room, while Mrs. Maxa followed. Salo then returned to the carriage, where the stiff boy sat firmly, holding the reins. Salo's arrival was met with excitement from the children, who embraced their Uncle Philip tightly. Uncle Philip praised the boy's responsibility for keeping the horses in check, and the children, caught up in the joy of their uncle's return, finally noticed Salo.

Bruno and Salo sat down together, engrossed in conversation. Meanwhile, Mea, Kurt, and Lippo searched for their mother, who had brought a sick child and couldn't meet them for a few days.

Mäzli, informed of the dinner, welcomed Salo warmly. They all sat down to a delightful meal, and Salo expressed his happiness, wishing he could stay longer.

"""Alright, Salo, you're spot on,"" Uncle Philip praised. ""Sometimes we just have to accept things as they are, even if we're not thrilled about it. Let's not keep urging him to stay. How about we play a fun game and make the most of our time together?"" Mäzli wasn't pleased with this idea; she was really into the game. Sitting next to Salo, who had been quite entertaining, she preferred staying up late over going to bed. Sneaking up behind Uncle Philip's chair, she wrapped her arms around his neck and whispered, ""Uncle Philip, today is special, right? Can't we stay up a bit longer? The game is so enjoyable, and going to bed seems boring."" Excited, Mäzli returned to her spot, and the laughter continued. Uncle Philip's witty comments added to the amusement. Unnoticed, Mäzli grew quiet. Kathy returned with news that Mäzli had been put to bed and was now peacefully asleep. Uncle Philip suggested it was time for everyone to head to bed, noticing how tired Lippo looked. Despite his resistance, Lippo was eventually led away.

Kurt picked a fitting song, and Uncle Philip led it so energetically that everyone could chime in, forming a strong chorus. Lippo's voice was weak, but he sang every note, battling sleepiness. The group then headed upstairs to their rooms. Uncle Philip sighed with relief at reaching the top. Bruno asked if Kurt could sleep in the guest room so Salo could stay in Kurt's bed. Uncle Philip rejected the idea due to guest etiquette. Instead, he suggested sleeping in Bruno's bed while the boys stayed in the guest room. The issue was resolved, and everyone prepared for bed.

The Baron was impressed by the transformation of the once gloomy room. Later, they had a long conversation, and Loneli eagerly awaited news about Kurt and Mea. The family spent a quiet day in the garden, anticipating Leonore's last Sunday. Unexpectedly, they received an invitation from the Castle-Steward for a visit to Castle Wildenstein, bringing immense joy to everyone, except for a pensive Leonore.|"[""1.

Mea felt a wave of sadness after hearing hurtful words. Kurt's dreams of triumph kept him awake, making it hard to settle down for the night. The mother, unable to keep up with the boys, assigned guides for the group. As they approached a grand door, they were greeted by Mr. Trius in his finest attire.

When Mrs. Maxa signaled the end of the cheerful supper gathering, there was no sadness in the air. The Baron had already shared the news that Leonore would soon be moving up to the castle, where everyone would gather. The excitement continued the next day with three letters sent to Salo - one from Bruno, one from Leonore, and one from Mrs. Maxa. Salo was most thrilled by Mrs. Maxa's letter, inviting him to his new home. News of the Baron's return and the reunion of the families had spread. The district attorney's wife visited Mrs. Maxa, discussing Salo's son joining the town's lads. Loneli brought a message from Elvira to Mea, seeking forgiveness in exchange for meeting Leonore. However, Mea was uninterested, sharing news that they would have a private tutor at the castle. This delighted Loneli, as she wouldn't have to face any more shame. Leonore, focused on family, had no interest in new friendships. Uncle Philip was urged to visit soon to learn more about Leonore's move to the castle.|"[""1.
