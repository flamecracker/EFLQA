"Mr. Farnum nodded as the boat rowed to the shore, and Andrews and his crew were placed on the ""Pollard"" at the platform deck. Captain Jack Benson unlocked the door to the conning tower and was the first to go below. Returning with a line and heavy sounding-lead, he mentioned sounding the harbor's deep spots. As they rowed, Captain Jack instructed Hal to navigate over areas where the submarine could hide underwater. The men had been practicing telegraphy to send and receive wireless messages.

Eph sighed, feeling unlucky after realizing the information he sought was in a book from ten years ago. Meanwhile, Jacob Farnum, busy with the marine glasses, spotted a military mast heading their way. Urging the young men to act quickly, the 'Hudson' was approaching. Andrews and his team swiftly made final adjustments on the submarine boat as the sun set, revealing a naval vessel nearing the harbor. Jack and Hal observed from the deck as Jack signaled the approaching boat. Quickly, they rowed towards the gunboat, with Jack climbing aboard while Hal rowed back. Despite a misunderstanding with the naval officer, Jack expertly guided the gunboat into the harbor. As tension lingered, Jack declined Hal's offer for assistance, and the onlookers at the 'Farnum' observed the unfolding events with curiosity.|"['1.

"Between the decks, the engines of the ""Hudson"" were working hard to free the craft from the sand. Suddenly, the machinery stopped, prompting an engineer officer to investigate. As they discovered the propellers were buried in the sand, making it impossible to drive off, tension arose. Mr. Mayhew, feeling frustrated, muttered about the situation. However, Jacob Farnum, the owner, had faith in his young captain, Jack. Despite the misunderstanding, Jack remained composed and level-headed. Mr. Farnum advocated for treating Jack as a man and giving him a fair chance to explain. Eventually, the issue was resolved when Jack clarified his intentions, earning respect and trust from all parties involved.

The flood tide was expected in about two and a half hours, which would help raise the vessel. With the assistance of a tow boat and the submarine engines, along with the crew's efforts, there was a good chance of getting the 'Hudson' afloat. The team even used winches and extra cables to provide a strong pull. Later, Jack and his employer joined the naval officers for dinner on the gunboat. After dinner, a towboat arrived in the harbor, and hawsers were secured to the gunboat and submarines. With the help of winches and engines, a mighty pull was made, successfully freeing the 'Hudson' into deep water. Mr. Farnum then invited some officers ashore to explore the area and offered to take them for a ride in his car. Jack, Hal, and Eph decided to keep a low profile with the naval officers. Benson also provided a dollar to a man named Samuel Truax, suggesting he join them on board the next morning.|"[""1.

Jack Benson quickly reassured his companion that he couldn't take any liberties with the boat as he wasn't the owner. He mentioned the possibility of Mr. Farnum returning late with naval officers. However, he noticed the night watchman at the gate. Jack informed his friend about a man with a letter for Mr. Farnum, emphasizing that he couldn't let him in without Mr. Farnum's approval. Later, the boys enjoyed some hot soda and watched a movie. On their way home, Jack realized he had forgotten a book and retraced his steps. Suddenly, a bag of sand thrown over a fence knocked him unconscious. Truax, the culprit, assessed Jack's condition and left him there, making it seem like Jack had been in a fight. Truax disposed of the evidence and left Jack behind. Despite his injuries, Jack managed to regain consciousness, ensuring he wasn't left vulnerable.|"[""1.

Hal and Eph had been waiting at the shore boat for a while before deciding to head back to find their missing leader. Just as they were about to search for him, they saw Jack Benson's head pop up through a fence. Jack seemed too sore and dazed to talk, struggling to gather his thoughts due to the pain in his head. Andrews suggested carrying Jack to Mr. Farnum's office to get him help quietly, as they didn't want rumors spreading about Jack's condition. However, before they could act, Mr. Farnum arrived with naval officers. They noticed liquor on Jack's clothing, suspecting foul play. Despite doubts from one officer, Jack was taken to the office for medical attention. The doctor found no skull fractures but detected liquor on Jack's coat. Medicated, Jack fell asleep as the submarine boats set sail, embarking on a strange voyage.|"[""1.

Benson faced a puzzling situation but decided to pause his thoughts for later. He continued getting ready, buttoning his blouse precisely and placing his cap on his aching head before stepping out into the cabin. Despite the ship's slight roll, he reached the conning tower where Hal was steering. Eph Somers joined, offering support as Jack sat beside Hal. They discussed the new crew members and Jack's fatigue, but he insisted on staying active, feeling a sense of pride being among the Navy vessels. Hal, being practical, acknowledged their limitations of not being Navy officers but focused on their current roles. The idea of others commanding submarines in war left them contemplative but determined to excel in their current duties.|"['1.

Jack Benson endured a throbbing head and dizzy spells while standing beside his friend for an hour. Despite feeling unwell, he refused help and descended to rest in the cabin. Eph provided him with a pillow and blanket, and Jack fell into an uneasy sleep, disturbed by the dull ache in his head. Eph reflected on his temperament, acknowledging his potential for unpleasantness when crossed. Jack awoke later in the afternoon to find Eph bringing him toast and broth. Eph reassured Jack about his absence from the conning tower duties, mentioning that they were set to drop anchor soon. Jack, relieved to have a break due to his headache, pondered about a possible assailant from the previous night.

The boat at the shore was ready to take them to land. Captain Benson secured the conning tower before they left. Truax was quiet as they moved through the Academy grounds. Lights glowed in the Cadet Barracks where the Navy students studied. Some officers and sentries roamed while the submarine party headed to Annapolis. They explored the town, with bustling streets and quiet colonial houses. Jack found an oyster house and read the local paper. The sleepy town made him yawn. An old man shared tales of voodoo doctors, intriguing Jack despite his skepticism. The voodoo practices from Africa fascinated many, promising cures to believers.|"['1.

The guide explained that Marse Truax was too unwell to receive the voodoo treatment he requested. As the voodoo practitioner chanted, Marse Truax collapsed, frothing at the mouth. Although he had improved slightly, he couldn't leave the voodoo's house without assistance. Jack was intrigued by the experience and regretted that his friend Hal had missed it. The cab stopped on a secluded country road lined with trees, leading to a dark, old house. The guide hinted at witnessing voodoo work as they entered the house quietly. Jack felt a mix of awe and fear but remained brave. Suddenly, he stumbled and fell into a pit, where he was confronted by two fierce dogs.

Jack lay there, his thoughts swirling in the darkness. The mulatto's words echoed in his mind, warning of the fighting dogs above. Fear gripped him, knowing one wrong move could bring them down. With a bitter realization, he understood the danger he was in. The trap was set, and he was the unsuspecting victim. Would the dogs pounce if he made a sound? Jack shivered, feeling the chill of the night. The snoring of the dogs above reminded him of the peril he faced. The mulatto's voice cut through the silence, demanding Jack to undress.

Jack, feeling a mix of anger and helplessness, reluctantly followed the mulatto's commands. He removed his clothes and valuables, handing them over as the mulatto's dogs watched closely.

Jack agreed with a grimace, acknowledging the difficult task of explaining the truth to Mr. Mayhew, who seemed skeptical. Seated in his cabin, Mr. Mayhew, a naval officer, addressed Jack sternly about his role as a civilian instructor in submarine boating for cadets. Though not under naval discipline, Jack was expected to follow rules. Mr. Mayhew, temporarily in charge, listened as Jack recounted the previous night's events. Mr. Mayhew warned Jack about the importance of maintaining respect and confidence as an instructor. He emphasized the need for cadets to trust their instructors. Later, Mr. Mayhew informed Jack about the cadets' schedule to board the submarine.

In the town, the submarine boys explored public buildings like a church, a general store, and a drug-store. However, the drug-store didn't have ice cream or soda, so they left. Later, they found a groggery where sailors were enjoying drinks. A man there offered them grog and invited them to his shack to see his collection of yacht models. They agreed and found the cabin cozy with mahogany trim, a sideboard, and cushioned berths. Curtis then mesmerized Jack with his voice until he finally snapped out of it.|"['1.

The surgeon nodded in agreement, impressed by the physical condition of the submarine boys.

Young Captain Benson addressed his fellow naval cadets, warning them that the half-hour underwater would feel like an eternity. Despite their bravery, the cadets squirmed at the thought of spending more time submerged. As the electric motors hummed quietly, tension filled the submarine.

The liner's passengers had joked about a submarine pirate intercepting them, but the encounter was far from amusing.

Upon receiving a report through a megaphone, Lieutenant Commander Mayhew immediately acted by instructing all the soaked and now cold midshipmen to board the main ship. Once aboard, they were provided with rub-downs, dry clothes, and hot black coffee. Even Jack Benson was directed to come on board and had to face Doctor McCrea. Sam Truax obediently followed instructions and sat quietly while Doctor McCrea checked his temperature. The doctor then decided to take Truax to the sick bay, which is the hospital area of a warship equipped to care for ill individuals. Truax was placed in one of the comfortable berths. However, his condition worsened despite receiving medication, and he confessed to being involved in a scheme to deceive the Naval Academy.

Yes. From what I heard, he was the man with a black beard who drugged and kidnapped you on the white ship. Tip usually doesn't wear a beard. He grew it recently to hide from those who know him. He rented a house in Blair's Cove to observe. He had a tip that the training cruise would focus on this bay. Dr. McCrea laughed, impressed by Jack Benson's cleverness in getting you to confess. When you were brought in, you weren't really sick, just scared. The doctor gave you medicine to make you feel unwell. Truax escaped while out on deck with a guard.
