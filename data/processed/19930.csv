Well armed and filled with determination, the Diamond X expedition set off on a trail that would lead them through days and nights of challenging terrain. They were well-prepared, knowing the importance of conserving their resources, including their horses and rations. As they made camp for the night, the group discussed the impending encounter with the Yaquis, feeling a mix of excitement and apprehension. While they felt safe in friendly territory, the possibility of facing the elusive Yaquis kept them on edge. Suddenly, a commotion from one of the cowboys alerted the camp, causing everyone to grab their guns and be ready for any threat. The bright blaze of the fire illuminated the faces of the Indian trackers nearby, adding to the tension of the moment. Amidst speculations about the distant lights in the sky, the group remained vigilant, knowing that capturing the Yaquis would require more than just luck.|['1.

It was cold in the open early in the morning. Even though the days were hot, the temperature dropped once the sun set. Everyone gathered around the fire to warm up before wrapping in blankets until sunrise. The camp was undisturbed except for concern about shooting stars. By daybreak, the fire was rekindled, and the aroma of coffee and bacon filled the air. Rolling Stone's pancake skills outshone the rest, flipping them flawlessly in the pan. As breakfast ended, the group mounted their horses, heading north where the Yaquis had gone. Nort spotted a lone horseman approaching, who turned out to be Buck Tooth, dressed in a mix of American and Mexican Indian attire. The ranchers were puzzled by his unexpected appearance.|"['1.

Buck Tooth, the Native American helper at Happy Valley, faced a barrage of questions. Despite his stoic demeanor, he and Bud, the boy rancher, shared a deep understanding.

The boy ranchers and their friends set up camp in a secluded glade, using rocks and brush as natural cover. Shots from ambushers were fired from one side, prompting Snake to warn everyone to be cautious. Despite the desire to rest, the group remained on guard due to the imminent danger. Bullets flew, hitting rocks with sharp sounds. Snake, with a touch of humor, advised everyone to stay low. Amid the tension, a bullet grazed a cowboy's ear, escalating the situation. Snake and Yellin' Kid strategized for a potential prolonged conflict. The horses, a vital asset in the wilderness, were safe and undisturbed. Snake then divided the group, preparing some for action while others stayed behind under Kid's watchful eye.|"[""1.

Once a feared and loathed enemy of Diamond X ranch, Del Pinzo's name no longer brought anger from the cowboys. When Dick's cry revealed the presence of the ruthless cattle rustler, caution silenced any response. Del Pinzo's gang had ambushed their friends, a surprise to all. A shot from Snake disarmed Del Pinzo, causing a momentary disablement. Del Pinzo, surprised, obeyed when warned at gunpoint by the cowboy. Del Pinzo claimed they mistook the boys for Yaquis, seeking an alliance. Snake, cautious, preferred to part ways, unsure of Del Pinzo's intentions.

Snake, the outlaw, ordered Del Pinzo and his band to march out without guns, mistaking them for Yaquis. Del Pinzo complied, marching out with his men, hands raised, while Snake and his group watched. Snake instructed them to wait in a nearby scrub until they were far away. Once safe, Snake would fire a shot as a signal for them to retrieve their horses and guns. Suspicious of Snake's motives, Del Pinzo and his men complied, relieved when Snake finally let them lower their hands. They followed Snake's orders, allowing their saddles and bridles to be packed on the Diamond X pack animals. The guns from the ambush were collected, and they set off after breakfast, wary of the Mexican Indians they encountered. Rosemary remained cautious, recognizing the need to watch for an opportunity to escape from the less clever Mexican Indians.|[]|[]
"Floyd confidently described the group of men as repulsive, dirty, and armed with weapons, making them a dangerous crew of pirates and cut-throats. Despite their desperate situation, Rosemary and her brother remained hopeful that help would arrive, possibly from the Diamond X boys.

Rosemary and Floyd found themselves in a precarious situation as they rode deeper into the mountains with their captors. Despite their weariness, they had no choice but to continue riding. The afternoon passed slowly, with tensions rising among the group about where to camp for the night. When they finally stopped, Mike, one of the captors, roughly handled Rosemary and Floyd. Meanwhile, Bud, Nort, and Dick from Diamond X were unaware of the unfolding events as they followed the trail to rescue their friends. The group was cautious, knowing the importance of conserving their horses' energy for the challenging terrain ahead.

Yellin' Kid, having vented his emotions, appeared more at ease. He greeted the other cowboys cheerfully and urged his pony to catch up with the lead group. The Diamond X crew continued their journey, keeping watch for any signs of Yaquis. Snake Purdee, a seasoned cowboy, shared insights with the group, cautioning them about the unpredictable nature of the Yaquis. Rolling Stone, another experienced hand, suspected foul play behind the abduction of Miss Rosemary and Floyd. As they discarded unnecessary supplies to lighten their load, the group pressed on towards the mountains, aware of the dangers ahead.

He and his companion boy ranchers were willing to endure all the hardships and dangers with the more seasoned cowboys, and Bud and Nort, who until within a comparatively recent time were unused to western ways, were now accounted as capable as Bud, than which there was no higher praise. 

There was evident in the manner in which campfires were built, and a system of sentinel guards posted, that the older men realized the nearness of danger. The cowboys had dropped their half bantering manner and sat grim-lipped and thoughtful of eye about the blaze. This change in their manners affected our youthful heroes who looked at one another somewhat apprehensively, and more than once let their hands stray to their weapons.

But the night passed without untoward incident, if we except a false alarm given by Bud when he was standing guard.

Bud and his friends found themselves surrounded by strange horsemen. Snake, the leader, quickly instructed everyone to form a defensive circle behind rocks, anticipating the attackers' strategy. Each member of the group, including the boy ranchers, armed themselves with rifles and revolvers, all using the same caliber ammunition for efficiency. As the dust settled from the approaching horsemen, it became clear they were cavalry lancers from Uncle Sam's forces. A bugle signaled their approach, causing initial tension. However, the troopers turned out to be after the same enemies the group was pursuing. The troopers welcomed Bud and his friends, avoiding a potential conflict. The lancers explained they had strayed off course and invited the group to meet Captain Marshal.

On the way, Snake Purdee, who rode beside Captain Marshall, shared details about the capture of Rosemary and Floyd. The officer had heard a similar story, wired to distant points in the belief that the Yaquis would scatter, making their direction unpredictable.

""We shot him and his followers up a bit,"" Snake admitted, ""but we didn't damage 'em as we ought. However, we took their horse furniture and guns away and left 'em their animals. It'll be a few days before they get active again.""

The scout saluted as his commanding officer rode up, and the others, understanding the need for reserve, held back until the captain indicated readiness to talk. After a discussion with Private Kelly, the captain invited everyone to approach.

Bud explained that Indian trailers can discern many details from horse tracks, like the gait and the rider's experience. They were on the Yaquis' trail, who still held Rosemary and Floyd captive. The siblings vowed not to be separated. When the captors tried to take Rosemary alone, she boldly threatened them with her gun, asserting they would stay together. The Yaquis hesitated, realizing Rosemary's determination and sharpshooting skills. Rosemary cleverly shot near Mike to show her marksmanship, causing the Yaqui leader, Paz, to intervene and prevent further separation attempts.

Rosemary, armed and clever, held off the Indians with her weapon, surprising them with her skill. She knew her gun gave her an advantage, especially as a woman facing ruffians. The Indians, unaware of her weapon, were cautious after her display. Floyd, disarmed early, was grateful for Rosemary's quick thinking. They were led to a rocky cave, a primitive prison, with minimal food. Rosemary believed the captors sought ransom. As they settled in for the night, Rosemary and Floyd faced the reality of their situation. Despite the discomfort and uncertainty, they found comfort in each other's company and the bitter coffee provided.

The Indians were preparing to move, and Rosemary and Floyd were uncertain how deep into the mountains they would be taken. Suddenly, commotion erupted in the main camp, signaling a new development. Alarmed cries filled the air, and Mike, looking fearful, gestured for them to follow. Despite Rosemary's barrage of questions, Mike remained silent. As they were handed their horses, Rosemary expressed her dismay at riding the uncomfortable ponies. Ready for a ride, Rosemary boasted of her riding skills, eager to prove herself. Floyd, a skilled rider himself, mounted his horse as they were led out of the camp. They noticed the Yaquis splitting into two groups, with Paz leading one away. Rosemary and Floyd were unsettled by the separation, preferring to deal with Paz over Mike. Floyd lamented the lack of a gun to potentially overpower their captors.|"[""1.

"Floyd exclaimed, ""Soldiers! I forgot about them. Troopers are stationed nearby, and news of the Yaquis' uprising will reach them. Maybe U.S. Regulars are on their way to rescue us, Rose!"" As they rode together, Floyd pondered why the Yaquis didn't take them back into Mexico instead of heading into the United States. Rosemary suggested they might have feared crossing the well-guarded border or didn't want to share their spoils. The siblings were puzzled as most Yaquis followed Paz, leaving the captives with Mike. The discovery of the Yaqui trail lifted their spirits. Meeting the U.S. Troopers was fortunate, as Bud remarked they would have been lost without them. The boys discussed the differences between Yaquis and American Indians, with Dick recalling an Indian stone pipe at home.

"Bud shared, ""Rex Beach doesn't think much of the Yaquis. In his book, he humorously mentions how they enjoy halting Southern Pacific trains. It's like a sport to them."" Bud added, ""Although Beach writes well and has great movies, he might have been joking about the Yaquis. Nevertheless, we know the harm they've caused our friends, and it's our turn to retaliate."" The group paused upon discovering new Indian tracks in the soil. Captain Marshall decided to halt for a meal break, allowing scouts to investigate further. The well-provisioned soldiers invited their friends to share their rations. Bud suggested that Buck Tooth, who claimed to be a Yaqui, could interpret the Indian signs found. Buck Tooth's discovery of a trail in the opposite direction led to excitement among the scouts. Snake reminded the boys to follow Captain Marshall's lead during the impending confrontation with the Yaquis. The troops prepared for action as scouts reported the Yaquis' location three miles ahead. Despite their initial disappointment at the fight's start, Dick and Nort were eager for the romanticized battle against the Indians. They had grown up reading thrilling tales of Indian warfare, admiring their daring tactics and swift attacks."|"['1.

Nort and Dick were prepared for the disappointment of not encountering the traditional, romanticized image of Indians they had imagined. The Yaquis they faced lacked warpaint, feathered headdresses, and bows and arrows. The troopers, on the other hand, demonstrated strategic warfare, sending their horses to safety before engaging in battle. Each trooper sought cover and aimed at their targets, planning a rush when the time was right. The fight took place in a valley with natural shelters, preventing easy retreat. Troopers and Yaquis exchanged gunfire, with the troopers showing superior training and marksmanship. Despite casualties on both sides, the Yaquis fought fiercely and skillfully. Troopers strategically positioned themselves to prevent the Yaquis from retreating with captives. The troopers' disciplined approach contrasted with the Yaquis' more haphazard tactics.|"['1.

Our heroes faced a fierce battle. Nort suffered a wound in his left leg, while Dick narrowly escaped a bullet grazing his ear. Bud, with a painful hand injury, had to retreat. Despite the injuries, they fought bravely. The troopers attacked the Yaquis, causing chaos. The Captain's strategy led to the Indians surrendering. The Yaquis, worn and defeated, accepted defeat. The troopers, ready for any trickery, negotiated the surrender. The Yaquis, dirty and exhausted, knew further resistance was futile. The troopers, with the upper hand, accepted the Yaquis' surrender. This marked the end of the intense battle, with the Yaquis defeated and the troopers victorious.|"['1.

As the group of rescuers completed their search of the Yaquis camp, they found several dead and severely wounded Indians. Despite the hostility during the fight, the wounded were tended to, and the dead were respectfully buried. With the prisoners secured and the injured cared for, the focus shifted to locating Rosemary and Floyd. The captives were puzzled by their disappearance, suspecting that another group of Yaquis might have taken them away. The rescue party intensified their efforts to find the missing siblings. Lieutenant Snow, acting as an interpreter, pressed Paz for information, suspecting he knew more than he revealed. Buck Tooth, an observant Indian among the captives, cunningly exposed the truth about Rosemary and Floyd's abduction, leading to a new mission to rescue them deeper in the mountains.

"""Great news!"" exclaimed Nort. While he valued the cowboys from Diamond X, there was something about the troopers that gave him confidence. The cowboys were also pleased to have the regulars with them. ""Let's organize this properly,"" suggested the captain. ""Lieutenant Snow, prepare to take your men and escort the outlaws back over the border or to La Nogalique. The United States Marshal may want to handle them there. Contact the fort after delivering the prisoners for further instructions."" Buck Tooth revealed how his teasing had revealed the truth from the captive Yaquis, unraveling the mystery for the experienced cowboys and troopers. Paz, aware of the soldiers and cowboys closing in, sent the captives away to avoid their wrath.

The boy ranchers faced hard work and danger from the start when Rosemary and Floyd were kidnapped. The tension was high, wearing them down as they rode, fearing ambush by lurking Yaquis. Despite the grim journey, they pressed on without complaint, even when Bud suffered a painful hand injury. Captain Marshall's skill helped treat Bud's wound, preventing further complications. As night fell, the ranchers rested under blankets, ready for duty. Nort and Dick, vigilant against Yaqui attacks, were startled by an eerie cry in the darkness. At dawn, the troopers and cowboys prepared for a possible attack, but breakfast passed without incident. The captives' fate remained uncertain as the group continued their strenuous journey.|"['1.

As the path grew clearer, more care was taken to avoid any surprises. A sudden attack in the rugged valleys they traveled through would have been extremely dangerous. Scouts led the way, ready to warn the group of any danger. The morning passed without incident, except for a couple of false alarms. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief when lunch was served without interruption from enemy fire. After a short break, they resumed their journey. Suddenly, a shot rang out ahead, putting everyone on edge. The scouts returned with news of an ambush by Yaqui warriors. Captain Marshall quickly organized his troops for what could be the final battle. The Yaquis had the upper hand with their strategic position in the rocky terrain, making it challenging for the rescuers to advance.

The Yaquis had an advantage in their fortified position, but they were outnumbered by the soldiers and cowboys. The soldiers were experienced fighters, while the Indians were more like bandits. The stakes were high as the Indians knew they had to protect Rosemary and Floyd to avoid swift retribution. Bud and his cousins were eager to help and finally allowed to move closer to the action. Rosemary and Floyd were hidden in a cave behind the Yaquis' stronghold. Rosemary believed their rescuers were on their way, but the siblings were in a tough spot after losing their weapon. Despite their injuries, they remained hopeful that their friends would break through the Indian defenses. The cave provided a temporary refuge, shielded by a solid rock wall, as the intense battle unfolded outside.|"['1.

The steep rocky wall loomed over the cowboys and soldiers attacking below, making it nearly impossible to descend. The narrow passage up was blocked by rocks the Indians had piled there.

Casualties occurred, with Dick wounded but not seriously. Nort and Bud remained loading, while Rosemary and Floyd anxiously waited inside the cave.

Floyd didn't pause to question his sister's ominous words. He feared her spirit was failing. Glancing at Rosemary, he embarked on a risky plan to find a way out without endangering her. As they conversed, the guard kept a watchful eye on them. Floyd feigned aimless wandering towards a break in the wall, hoping to spy on the Yaquis below. Determined, he attempted to dislodge a massive rock to thwart the Yaquis. Despite his efforts, the rock wouldn't budge, frustrating his escape plan. He struggled with the rock, teetering on the edge of success, but gravity won, thwarting his attempt to crush the Yaquis below.|"['1.

Once the boy had made up his mind on what to do, he wasted no time in carrying out his plan. Swiftly, he gathered the broken pieces of his lever and headed back towards the cave where he and his sister were being held captive. Below, Rosemary and Floyd could only speculate about the ongoing events. They could tell that the rescuers were making the most of every opportunity by the occasional hits they made on the Yaquis. The attackers were careful with their ammunition, as instructed by Captain Marshall, the commander of the troopers. After a fierce fusillade, the firing suddenly stopped, allowing a break to tend to the wounded and provide much-needed water.
