During a tense moment, Jack Carleton meticulously reloaded his rifle, following the steps he had learned. He carefully poured gunpowder from a cow's horn into his hand and then down the barrel. With precision, he placed a muslin piece on top and used a ramrod to secure it. Next, he inserted a bullet he had made himself and another muslin piece. After securing the ramrod and priming the pan, the old-fashioned rifle was ready for action. Jack's anxiety grew as he followed the trail of a galloping horse, suspecting Indians were nearby. He cautiously left the trail to avoid confrontation, moving silently like a skilled tracker. As he hid near a tree, two Indian warriors passed by, inspecting the area. Jack refrained from attacking, knowing the consequences would be dire. The warriors soon discovered the panther's body and the footprints of the hunter who had slain it.

"The gentle whisper heard when holding a seashell to the ear filled the night air. It was the voice of the night - the rustling of the wind among the trees, the soft touch of the leaves.

The wise suggestion was promptly acted upon by the friends as they ventured into the open wood to find a safe spot for a fire and conversation away from potential enemies. Suddenly, a rifle shot rang out, narrowly missing Otto's forehead and causing a moment of intense fear. Reacting quickly, Otto spurred his horse into a frantic gallop to escape the danger. Despite the close call, only one shot was fired, leaving Otto puzzled by the lack of more gunfire. As he rode, Otto was so focused on avoiding overhanging branches and imagined threats from Indians that he barely looked up. The real danger came when his horse unexpectedly leaped into the river, plunging Otto into the icy water. Struggling to stay afloat and save his rifle, Otto narrowly escaped disaster when a tree limb nearly knocked him unconscious.

Deerfoot, a young Shawanoe, had a striking appearance with a classical regularity to his features. His slightly Roman nose and thin lips gave him an expression of firmness and nerve. When facing the great Tecumseh in mortal combat, his eyes flashed lightning, and his muscles were as strong as iron. Deerfoot's love for finery was evident in his attire, adorned with eagle feathers, colored fringes, and beaded moccasins. He carried a quiver of arrows and relied on his bow for defense. A fierce band of Shawanoes and Hurons once attacked the settlement of Coatesville, leaving many hearths darkened. Among the fallen defenders was Abram Carleton, leaving his widow and son Jack to face the aftermath. The widow Carleton, devastated by the loss, decided to move to Missouri with Jack to start anew, leaving behind the shadows of sorrow and woe.|['1.

One day, Otto rode ahead of his friend and was shot at by Indians, barely escaping. Jack thought it wise to let Deerfoot, a skilled Shawanoe warrior, paddle them across the river in his canoe. Deerfoot led them through the woods until they found a safe spot to rest. Despite losing their blankets, the mild night and the campfire kept them warm. Otto, younger and broader than Jack, had a funny appearance due to his wide face, pug nose, and short neck. His father, known for being miserly, would be upset if Otto returned without the horse that had run away. Otto wore a unique hat, stiffened by his mother, unlike Jack's cap. The boys, with hearty appetites, were content to wait until the next day for their next meal. Deerfoot, disciplined from childhood, had no issue with fasting. Jack asked Deerfoot how he met Otto, prompting a smile from the Shawanoe warrior.|"['1.

Two days ago, Deerfoot stumbled upon a log cabin during a rainy and cold evening, far from his home. He noticed a faint light and tried to open the door, but it was locked. When he knocked, the man inside insulted him, threatening to shoot him if he didn't leave. As Deerfoot started to walk away, a boy's voice called him back. The boy covered Deerfoot with a blanket, snuck him in through a window, and fed him. The boy's father punished him severely for helping Deerfoot, but the Shawanoe warrior was grateful. Deerfoot had promised to meet Otto and his friend at the Mississippi River to help them cross in his canoe.

When the evening advanced, Otto added more wood to the fire, creating a cheerful glow. Deerfoot got up, silently ventured into the darkness, and returned after a quick reconnaissance. He assured his companions of safety before reading from a small Bible given to him by Mrs. Preston. The others were captivated as Deerfoot, with deep emotion, read a chapter from Revelations. Otto, unfamiliar with Christian teachings, was moved by the solemn words. Curious, Deerfoot wrote the Lord's Prayer in his native Shawanoe language for Jack, who was touched by the gesture. The boys then slept peacefully under Deerfoot's watchful eye.

Jack Carleton was amazed by the information Deerfoot had gathered. He remarked that the country beyond the Mississippi would overflow with people one day, making their own country great. Deerfoot, the young patriot, shared this vision but knew they wouldn't live to see it. As they reached the river, Deerfoot found their canoe while Jack and Otto prepared to swim if needed. Otto had crossed the river on horseback before by holding onto his horse's tail.

"Otto said, ""I don't believe that you and they can agree on the price. That's why you called me, so I can tell you what the price is. If they don't agree, then I'll knock them over the head, right?"" He pointed to where the orb would touch the sky around the middle of the afternoon. After warning the two to be careful and watch for detection, he disappeared into the woods instead of staying close to the shore. He headed south until he found the remains of his canoe. Determined to hold the culprits accountable, he followed their trail. As they were from the Miami tribe, he suspected they had a boat with them. Following the trail, he found a canoe with a Miami warrior fishing. Quietly approaching, Deerfoot jerked the canoe, causing the warrior to fall into the river.

Deerfoot had to control his laughter at the amusing sight of his captive, the Miami warrior, trying to act dignified. After pushing the canoe into the stream, Deerfoot swiftly paddled away, leaving the Miami behind. When Deerfoot signaled his friends with a whoop, the Miami, terrified, tumbled into the woods.

The Apaches have a clever tactic when being chased - they split up, making it impossible to follow them. Otto and Jack separated in the dense woods. Jack doubted if this strategy would be helpful, fearing it would be easier for the Indians to catch them one by one. However, he remembered that splitting up could sometimes be safer in Indian territory. While Jack stood still, he noticed two Shawanoe warriors ahead, deep in conversation. Jack hid behind a tree, observing them closely. The warriors, one Shawanoe and one Miami, seemed to be allies, posing a threat to Jack and his friend.

Listening carefully, he heard the warrior's soft footsteps on the leaves, almost as quiet as a small bird's claw. If the Shawanoe sensed any danger, his steps would be silent. The delicate sound stopped, leaving him wondering. Was the Indian onto him? Was he still or advancing soundlessly? These questions filled the young Kentuckian's mind. He pressed against the tree, gun ready, anticipating an attack. Jack realized the Shawanoe might be circling him, waiting for the right moment to strike. The suspense was intense.

Jack and Otto found themselves in a dangerous situation. Surrounded by Miamis and Shawanoes, they needed to find shelter quickly. Jack, feeling the safest near the Mississippi River, carefully led the way. As they cautiously made their way through the woods, they sensed someone or something approaching from behind. Prepared for danger, they readied their weapons. Suddenly, a bear emerged, heading towards the river. Jack and Otto stood aside, allowing the bear to pass peacefully. However, their peace was short-lived as gunshots and whoops echoed nearby, indicating that they were being hunted. Determined to evade capture, they hurried along the riverbank, facing obstacles like vines. The pursuing Indiana were getting closer, signaling that a confrontation was imminent. Otto, stumbling over the vines, joked about falling being a competition he would win.|['1.

It appeared like a sudden intervention from fate, catching both by surprise. The logs formed a shelter, but whether it harbored friends or foes was uncertain. The Kentuckian, Jack, spotted figures among the trees and a flash of red signaled danger. A shot narrowly missed as Jack and Otto raced for cover. The structure was a simple log enclosure, a welcome refuge for the fleeing boys. With pursuers closing in, Otto suggested a risky plan to use the walls to their advantage. As the enemy closed in, a Shawanoe warrior tried to climb over, only to meet Otto's swift shot. Another warrior followed, only to face Jack's rifle. The boys' limited firearms meant they had to be strategic, as reloading took time. The Indians' failed attempts hinted at the defenders' advantage, but the odds were still against them if the assailants persisted.|"['1.

Jack and Otto found a temporary refuge in a shelter, examining its bare walls and speculating on its unfinished state. The absence of windows made it hard to spot their attackers, but also protected them from outside threats. The boys realized their predicament was grim, stranded without food or water and no means of communication with their settlements. Hope turned to Deerfoot, a legendary Shawanoe known for his skills, but even his aid seemed unlikely. Curiosity led Jack to peek over the logs to spy on their enemies, but Otto wisely suggested a safer approach. The boys heard mysterious movements outside, hinting at ominous plans. Despite the danger, they were determined to survive and outwit their foes.|"['1.

It was simple for Jack to climb on his friend's shoulders, who easily supported his weight. Jack could then peer over the logs with ease. As he steadied himself against the wall, he raised his head to look over. Nearby, stumps and a single unused log lay, suggesting the builders had abandoned the work. Warriors were moving a log towards the fort, some watching instead of helping. Jack realized they intended to use it as a battering ram. The warriors raised the log against the fort wall, creating a monster-like figure. Jack and his friend stayed alert, knowing a crisis was imminent. Jack noticed warriors in the trees could easily attack. Suddenly, they spotted a Shawanoe warrior in a tree, aiming at them.

Deerfoot, the Shawanoe warrior, was hidden among the foliage, armed with a rifle and paint on his face. His friends, Jack and Otto, recognized him after a moment of uncertainty. Deerfoot signaled his identity by waving his hand. He tried to convey a message through gestures since he couldn't speak. When the boys failed to understand, Deerfoot aimed his rifle towards a tree where an enemy was climbing. Jack, with quick thinking, gestured to Deerfoot to alert him about the danger. Understanding Jack's signal, Deerfoot prepared to take action. Despite the risk, he aimed at the climbing enemy. The situation unfolded unnoticed by the other warriors, as they were occupied elsewhere. Jack and Otto remained vigilant, realizing more enemies might attempt the same tactic.

Our friends had a chance to move closer to the eastern wall to stay out of harm's way from the warrior, but Jack saw the value of keeping the attackers on edge. While the Miami warrior tried to climb the tree, Jack carefully aimed and fired, causing the warrior to fall with a loud screech. The wise Deerfoot decided to leave his position, fearing a similar fate. Jack reloaded quickly, staying alert for any threats. Otto also stayed vigilant, listening for any signs of danger outside the fort. He made a discovery near the wall and signaled Jack. Suddenly, a black bear appeared climbing the tree, but Jack realized it was a Shawanoe warrior in disguise. Jack felt chagrined for falling for the trick, realizing he should have seen through it.|"['1.

Jack and Otto were puzzled by the actions of the Indians. They couldn't understand why the fallen trunk was being used to help an Indian climb the wall when climbing a tree would have sufficed. Peering over the wall seemed pointless since the defenders posed no threat. The silence around them was eerie, hinting at impending danger. The boys remained vigilant, watching for any signs of the enemy's next move. Despite a failed attempt to breach their defenses, they knew the Indians might try again. Otto discovered a hidden crevice that could have been used by the enemy, but it was cleverly concealed. Jack, noticing this, made adjustments to prevent detection. Peeking through the crevice, he saw a surprising sight - an Indian warrior disguised as a dancing bear.|"['1.

Jack and his friend found themselves in a tense situation as they observed a group of Indians engaged in a mysterious conversation. Despite the Indians' animated gestures, their words were too soft to decipher clearly. Jack, using a stick to widen his view, failed to spot Deerfoot or any other figures near the tree. The Indians had likely skinned a bear, and Jack suspected they were plotting more trouble. One of the Shawanoes, who had previously tracked Jack's footprints, caught his eye, creating a tense moment. Deerfoot's attempt to help his friends by capsizing a Miami warrior's canoe had backfired, putting them in danger. The mistake was attributed to his playful nature overshadowing caution.

Upon reaching the Louisiana shore, Deerfoot swiftly hid his canoe and ventured into the woods to aid his friends. He concealed his identity by painting his face with crimson and altering his gait.

The situation was dire; the boys were cornered and in grave peril. Despite the risk, Deerfoot resolved to protect them. The hostile warriors sought retribution, aiming to harm the young pioneers.

Fortunately, the warriors were spread out, focused on the fort. Deerfoot saw a log being positioned on the wall, realizing a plan was forming. He hurried to a tree to warn his friends of the danger. Yet, underestimating his friends' skills, he tried to signal them from the tree. Failing to communicate, he almost fired his gun before Otto stopped him. Deerfoot knew he risked being discovered but was ready to face it. He observed a Miami warrior, fresh from a swim, talking with others, causing a stir. Soon, rifle shots rang out, confusing the warriors. Deerfoot knew time was running out for Jack and Otto. If not rescued soon, they would be in grave danger.

Deerfoot had a plan to save his endangered friends. He wrote a secret message on a piece of paper and attached it to an arrow. He shot the arrow over the heads of his friends, signaling them to listen for gunshots and shouts. The message instructed them to find a canoe by the river and paddle across quickly. As the attackers closed in, Deerfoot's diversion with sounds of fleeing warriors caused panic among the enemy. Jack and Otto, inside the enclosure, heard the commotion and saw the warriors fleeing. Otto quickly climbed over the logs, narrowly avoiding Jack's rifle that was flung in excitement.

The boys felt hopeful as they escaped their prison, heading towards the Mississippi River following Deerfoot's instructions. Jack led the way, but a mishap caused him to stumble. Despite Otto's fall, they pressed on, searching for the hidden canoe. Their impatience grew, knowing time was running out. Jack considered swimming across if the boat remained elusive.

Otto spoke slowly, voicing only a few of his thoughts. He was about to signal his friend to return and swim the river together when he noticed undergrowth by the water concealing something. With a sudden exclamation, he saw a canoe he had been seeking. Otto rose, realizing he had been sitting on the tree acting as a guide to the boat. He whistled for his friend, Jack, who quickly arrived. They found a fine Indian canoe with beautiful designs. Deerfoot, their friend, joined them and skillfully paddled the canoe. As they moved across the river, they saw four enemies aiming guns. Deerfoot dodged the bullets, and the canoe was hit but protected them. They lay low until the danger passed, amazed by Deerfoot's quick thinking and skill.|['1.

The sounds of gunfire echoed through the forest as the Shawanoe warrior quickly dipped his paddle back into the water after narrowly avoiding a third shot. Peering over the side of his canoe, he saw three warriors reloading their weapons while others approached. The German in the boat displayed incredible skill with his bow and arrow, forcing the enemy to take cover behind trees. As the canoe floated swiftly down the Mississippi, the Shawanoe realized they were in grave danger of being shot by the converging warriors. In a daring move, he plunged into the river, towing the canoe to safety while shielding himself and his companions from enemy fire.

Deerfoot, the skilled and silent warrior, effortlessly maneuvered the canoe, outsmarting his enemies who had punctured the boat with bullets. Jack, noticing the leak, tried to stop the water flow, but Deerfoot assured him it was unnecessary. Otto, the jovial German, found bullets in his hair, much to everyone's amusement. Despite the danger, Jack expressed gratitude for their miraculous escape. As they neared the shore, Otto's playful antics caused a sudden jolt, sending Jack tumbling in the canoe.

Otto Relstaub faced the consequences of his clumsy mishap with a canoe. As he tried to stand up, he ended up falling more dramatically than his friend. He sat down so forcefully that the canoe's side gave way, and he continued his fall onto dry land, where he was stopped by a small tree. Despite his embarrassing tumble, Otto gathered his belongings and inspected the damaged bark. Meanwhile, Jack Carleton regained his composure and found humor in Otto's misfortune, joined by their friend Deerfoot's silent but amused reaction. After a moment, Otto too began to laugh at the absurdity of the situation. Deerfoot, ever vigilant, cleaned his face of paint and scanned the surroundings for any lurking enemies. The group crossed the Mississippi, with their damaged canoe drifting away downstream. Jack Carleton reflected on leaving Kentucky behind, where painful memories of loss lingered, looking towards the unknown future that lay to the west.|"[""1.

Deerfoot and Otto quickly prepared for their journey, carrying only essential items. They felt relieved leaving Kentucky, a place plagued by danger from hostile tribes. Missouri, where they were heading, had less conflict between whites and Indians. The friends were less worried on the western shore. A settlement lay only two days away where Jack's mother, Otto's parents, and other families lived. Deerfoot, a young Shawanoe, planned to accompany them briefly, appreciating their friendship. Despite their admiration for him, Deerfoot modestly deflected their praise. They were concerned about Otto's father's reaction to losing the colt, fearing his cruelty. Deerfoot suggested they could recover the horse without much trouble and assured them of safety from hostile Indians. Unbeknownst to them, a canoe of war-painted red men lurked nearby. The boys, having crossed the Mississippi in a unique way, were close to where the colt entered Louisiana.|"['1.

Deerfoot, a skilled tracker, led his friends along the riverbank in search of a missing horse. Otto, struggling with his English, received encouragement from Jack to improve his speaking skills. As they followed the trail, Deerfoot's sharp eyes spotted the hoof-prints of the runaway horse. The group followed the tracks, noticing the colt had paused to graze before continuing toward Otto's cabin. Deerfoot predicted the horse might reach home before them if not intercepted. Suddenly, Deerfoot noticed a cloth on the ground, originally part of a bundle Otto had tied to the horse.

Deerfoot, Jack, and Otto were on a quest to find a missing colt and blanket. Deerfoot, a wise Shawanoe, hesitated to take back the blanket with the colt. Jack suggested a plan to save Otto from trouble by saying an Indian took the blanket. Deerfoot, with his silent steps, led the group to a spot with a clear view of the surrounding area. They saw the Mississippi River to the south and a distant campfire to the southward. Deerfoot noticed another campfire closer by, indicating red men were nearby. This discovery raised concerns about their safety and the lost horse. Despite the potential danger, Deerfoot remained calm, showing his friends there was no need to worry.

In the forest, a campfire smoldered, revealing the presence of Osage enemies. Deerfoot, Jack, and Otto stumbled upon the remnants of the camp, finding a strip of brilliantly colored blanket and partially cooked venison. The friends enjoyed a modest meal, grateful for the nourishment. Deerfoot led them to where the Osages had camped, discovering the direction they had traveled. Fortunately, they learned that the Osages were not actively hostile, but encountering them alone would be risky.

The hoof-prints revealed that the horse remained calm and unhurried. Despite occasional stops to nibble on vegetation, he kept a steady pace, albeit slow. Deerfoot, the Shawanoe, bid farewell as the boys continued their journey, veering off course at times. As they crossed Otto's trail, they noticed the hoof-prints leading north toward the Mississippi River. The boys realized they were near the missing horse when they found Jack's wet blanket left behind. They decided to camp for the night in a grassy clearing.

As night fell quickly, Otto and Jack were on the lookout for a horse. Otto was sure he spotted the animal, who seemed aware of their presence. They devised a plan: Jack would approach from one side while Otto took the other. Jack, being quicker, would signal Otto once in position. Otto would then try to calm the horse to capture it. However, as Otto closed in on the horse, he realized it was asleep. Just as he thought he had a chance, he got entangled in vines, causing a commotion.

Otto found himself entangled even more than before, struggling to move forward on his hands and knees. He regretted not having his rifle, realizing it would have likely gone off. As he hurried forward, ready to leap, he mistakenly grabbed what he thought was his colt, only to discover it was a tree stump. Feeling embarrassed and bewildered, Otto stood still, pondering his blunder. In the dim light, a lightning-struck tree stump resembled a horse. Suddenly, the smell of tobacco smoke signaled a stranger nearby, filling Otto with fear. A Native American warrior emerged, his imposing figure illuminated by the rising moon. The warrior's appearance was intimidating, with distinctive features and a scarred face. Holding a long clay pipe, he exuded an aura of mystery and danger, leaving Otto frozen in place.|['1.

The Native American's confident demeanor indicated his control of the situation. He appeared assured, especially when facing a young boy with no means of defense. As the warrior approached and greeted the boy, his blanket shifted to reveal a messy sash around his waist. Although the moonlight obscured a clear view, the boy noticed the tomahawk and hunting knife the Indian carried. Despite this, there was no immediate threat of using these weapons. The boy, if armed, would not have allowed the Indian to take his hand due to his knowledge of their treachery. The Indian's actions hinted at a plan, but success seemed unlikely. The boy, Otto, saw an opportunity when the Indian briefly turned away. This was his chance to make a move, grab his gun, and take control of the situation. The stakes were high as failure meant facing the Indian's wrath without mercy. Despite the tense situation, Otto remained hopeful for a favorable outcome.|"[""1.

In the dim moonlight, Otto cautiously followed the Osage chief, fearing an imminent attack. The Indian's imposing figure, puffing on his pipe, added to Otto's dread. Gripping his hunting knife, Otto prepared for a potential struggle. As they approached a flickering light, Otto realized the Osage had a specific destination. The light flickered in and out of view, guiding their path. Startled by a sudden movement near the fire, Otto cautiously entered the wigwam after a forceful nudge from the chief.

Otto, catching on, continued talking animatedly without pause. Jack subtly shifted his position to observe everyone in the wigwam discreetly. The visitors aimed to win the favor of the natives, understanding that emphasizing the importance of the baby was crucial. Otto had no suitable gift, fearing the consequences of offering his possessions. However, Jack had a British shilling and presented it to the infant, catching the attention of the parents. The baby, mistaking the coin for food, almost choked on it. The mother swiftly intervened, saving the child and retrieving the shilling. Jack felt relieved by the positive outcome, sensing no hostility in the wigwam. As Otto shared a familiar story, Jack remained attentive, wary of potential dangers lurking nearby. Observing the subtle communication between the chief and his wife, Jack realized that a silent understanding existed between them, despite their outward calm demeanor.|"['1.

The husband and wife communicated through smoke signals, sending messages with various puffs of smoke from their lips. Despite noticing they were being watched, they continued their silent exchange. The sachem seemed engrossed in something outside, while his wife tried to read the thoughts of Jack Carleton. The Shawanoe warrior, a feared member of the tribe, entered the lodge, seizing both boys' guns. He engaged in a conversation with the chief, seemingly about the boys. Otto's attempt to test the deerskins led to a comical mishap, but the warriors remained stoic. The Shawanoe positioned himself strategically, blocking the boys' escape and access to the guns. The tense situation left Jack and Otto powerless in the face of the Shawanoe's dominance.|"['1.

Jack strongly believed that other Shawanoes were nearby. It seemed unlikely that just one warrior had crossed the Mississippi alone when a dozen had failed to capture the boys. Jack thought the Shawanoes had found them and sent a warrior to talk with the Osage and hurry them out. He wished Deerfoot had stayed, as the Shawanoes' enmity towards him was intense. The boys suspected the hostiles might be numerous enough to follow both trails. While Wish-o-wa-tum and the visitor spoke, the boys tried to understand their conversation. Jack was wary of the Shawanoe's intentions and doubted anyone could defeat Deerfoot. Deerfoot, knowing his enemy's deceit, avoided confrontation and vanished swiftly into the forest, leaving his foe bewildered.|"['1.

Deerfoot, a swift and skilled Shawanoe warrior, raced through the night, his pace unyielding and his breath steady. Despite fleeing from one Shawanoe, his true pursuit was another, whom he sought with unwavering focus. As the moon rose, casting silvery light through the trees, Deerfoot paused to listen. Realizing he had lost the trail of his friends and foes, he faced a daunting challenge. Unable to discern his distance from the path, he knew returning was futile. Tracking at night demanded knowledge of the land, a skill Deerfoot lacked. Instead, he relied on a unique signal, a fluttering whistle rarely used by his people.

In the moonlit forest, Deerfoot, a young Shawanoe warrior, tracked the prints of horses and moccasins, realizing that the Shawanoes had split up. Stealthily following the elder Shawanoe, Deerfoot observed him near an open clearing where the boys had camped but left. The elder Shawanoe, Arorara, accused the boys of theft and murder, planning to capture them with the help of the Osage chieftain. Deerfoot, eavesdropping, understood the plan and hurried towards the Osage wigwam where the boys were. He saw the guns placed to lure the boys out. The chief agreed to help Arorara, seeing it as a way to avoid trouble with white settlers. Deerfoot knew the boys' danger and rushed to their aid, aware that a decisive moment was approaching.|"['1.

Deerfoot was faced with a difficult decision. If he denied the guest's request, his fierce tribe would seek revenge. Reluctantly, he agreed to help Arorara. As the two red men attempted to speak English, Deerfoot realized he needed to intervene. With swift precision, he entered the lodge and confronted the occupants, including Arorara.

Arorara, less brave than Tecumseh, was terrified by Deerfoot's presence, fearing a confrontation that could have ended in death. Despite his initial anger, Deerfoot, a Shawanoe like Arorara, chose not to fight, believing the Great Spirit would disapprove. The tension eased, and Deerfoot's friends, Jack and Otto, cautiously left the lodge, armed with rifles for protection.
