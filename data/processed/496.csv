Once a week, as tradition dictated, the Prince, adorned in his finest attire, visited his ailing father, the King, for a brief period. The King, consumed by illness and melancholy, often paid little attention to his son.

The boy, though not ugly, had a red face and messy hair. The little Prince admired his bright and jolly nature. The Prince's cloak, usually obedient, stayed in the air, confusing the boy.

Prince Dolor, a once royal child, lived in a tower with his nurse. His parents were gone, and his history was hidden. He spent his days reading and listening to his lark. Though he missed having parents, the lark's song comforted him. His godmother gave him treasures but left him alone to choose how to use them. Prince Dolor was a bright boy who could learn anything he wanted. He dreamed of becoming a king, thinking it must be grand to rule. This idea sparked a question to his nurse, who was taken aback.

Mag settled next to Prince Dolor, pointing out the wonders of the grand city of Nomansland. The metropolis was bustling with happy folks in carriages and on foot, yet others looked miserable. The magnificent palace, with its terraces and gardens, housed the king. Although it had a view of the Beautiful Mountains, it remained closed since the queen's death.

The room was silent, except for two flies buzzing near the bed. The Prince had been furious at his uncle for seizing the crown and imprisoning him. Yet, now, seeing his uncle at rest, he felt a sense of pity. As the city erupted with cries and chaos following the king's death, the Prince, floating above, heard the madness below.

I have recounted the story of Prince Dolor to the best of my ability, but the history of Nomansland remains unknown to me. If anyone is familiar with it, they might consider documenting it in another book. However, I am certain that Prince Dolor was an exceptional king. Having a godmother like the little old woman in gray undoubtedly contributed to his success. Despite facing challenges in his youth, Prince Dolor's upbringing made him capable of ruling wisely and justly. He sought advice, learned from others, and surrounded himself with the wise counsel of his kingdom.

King Dolor's kindness extended to his nurses, showing forgiveness and honor to them. When he decided to leave on a distant journey, he appointed his cousin's son as regent, a decision that was met with both wonder and acceptance from his people.

In the capital's grand square, the young prince was to take on his new role before his people. Tall and handsome, he stood out. Some said he was even more handsome than the king, who appeared weary on his throne. The king, with a mix of tenderness and awe from his people, spoke plainly, expressing his desire to rest after a long reign. He then revealed a mysterious bundle, untied it, and vanished into the sky on something like bird wings. A lark followed, singing joyfully. The king was never seen again, but his good deeds endured.

Once upon a time, a prince named Leander was mistaken for the king's son by visiting ambassadors. This led to a quarrel with a dwarf named Furibon. To escape the conflict, Leander was sent to a distant castle where he enjoyed hunting, fishing, and playing music. One day, while playing the flute in a garden, he encountered a snake. Despite being warned of its danger, Leander spared the snake and cared for it in a chamber. Meanwhile, court ladies missed Leander, while Furibon, fueled by jealousy, plotted against him.

When the young Prince turned twenty, his family and subjects wanted him to marry. They presented him with portraits of many princesses, but he chose Princess Darling, known for her beauty despite her slightly turned-up nose.
