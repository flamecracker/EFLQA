Flossie and Freddie, younger than Bert and Nan, were excited about the houseboat but had a different plan. They wanted to hitch Snap to the express wagon.

Snap, the brave dog, didn't hesitate when Flossie's doll fell into the water. He leaped in after it, holding the doll gently in his mouth. Meanwhile, Snoop, the black cat, was also struggling in the lake. Snap swam skillfully, first rescuing Snoop and then retrieving the doll. Everyone on the houseboat watched in amazement as Snap brought the doll back safely. The captain rowed a boat closer to help, but Snap managed to return the doll before the captain could reach him. Snap's heroic actions saved both Snoop and the doll, proving himself to be a loyal and courageous companion.|"[""1.

"""Girls, let's go!"" Mrs. Bobbsey exclaimed cheerfully. ""We're not dressed for the water!"" Laughing, she, Nan, and Dorothy hurried away from Snap's splashes. The meal was lively, but Flossie and Freddie were too thrilled to eat at first. Eating on a moving boat was a new experience. The children, especially the younger twins, kept jumping up to look out at the lake. Snap dried in the sun, and Snoop fluffed up after her swim. They found a cozy spot on deck together. The houseboat cruised on Lake Metoka all day. The children watched other boats pass by. Some carried lumber for Mr. Bobbsey, while others were pleasure boats. As night fell, the little ones drifted off to sleep, and the adults retired. In the middle of the night, Freddie awoke to the gentle rocking of the boat. The Bluebird sailed slowly, allowing the Bobbseys to savor the pleasant weather. After three days on the water, they headed towards Lemby Creek. Bert and Harry took turns steering the safe and leisurely houseboat. As they neared the creek's entrance, Nan spotted Will Watson, the farm boy who admired their boat. He waved and approached as Bert called out to him."|"[""1.

Later on, the houseboat gently touched the grassy bank, and the water was deep enough near the shore, so there was no need for the gangplank to be extended. Mr. Bobbsey realized that Flossie and Freddie couldn't jump off, so he asked Captain White to bring a smaller board. Bert suggested inviting Will aboard for corn muffins, but Will was hesitant as he needed to return to the farm. Mrs. Bobbsey gave Bert some muffins to share with Will. Bert and Will headed ashore, accompanied by Snap the dog. Meanwhile, Flossie played with her doll, and Freddie tried to teach Snoop tricks. The adults secured the houseboat, and Will shared some fish he caught during his break. Will knew he had a busy day ahead weeding onions far from the creek. The family decided to move the houseboat without using the engine for a peaceful night in a new location.|"['1.

Captain White and the Bobbsey family were on the Bluebird, a houseboat. They navigated through a narrow creek with pushing poles, heading towards wide meadows. As they approached a farmhouse, they planned to stop for a meal of corn muffins and fish. However, they witnessed a cruel farmer, Mr. Hardee, whipping a boy named Will for not working. Mr. Bobbsey intervened, confronting Mr. Hardee about the mistreatment of Will. The family watched anxiously from the boat as the tense situation unfolded. Mr. Hardee accused Will of slacking off instead of working on the farm. The Bobbseys were shocked by Mr. Hardee's harshness and stood up against his unjust treatment of the young boy.|"['1.

Mr. Bobbsey and Captain White decided to navigate the boat further down Lemby Creek and anchor it securely to the bank in a shadier area than the one near the farm buildings. However, their plans were thwarted when they encountered a sturdy wire fence stretching across a narrow section of the creek, blocking their path. Little Freddie, holding Snoop the cat, suggested cutting the wires to continue their journey. But Mr. Hardee, the farmer, revealed that he had put up the fence to prevent them from passing through his land due to a previous disagreement. Now, the Bobbsey family faced a dilemma as they couldn't proceed through the fence and going back wasn't an option. They needed to find a way to navigate around the obstacle to reach Lake Romano.|"['1.

"""We may need to delay our arrival,"" her father explained. ""For now, we must follow Mr. Hardee's instructions. Captain White, we'll need to reverse the boat since we can't pass the fence."" The creek by Mr. Hardee's farm was too narrow for the houseboat to turn around, so it had to move backward. Luckily, the Bluebird was designed to navigate in both directions. Slowly, the Bluebird maneuvered backward until it crossed the posts marking Mr. Hardee's property boundary. The twins' mother inquired about some missing corn muffins, reminding the children not to snack without permission.

When someone needs money to build a house but doesn't have enough, they can borrow it from another person, just like borrowing sugar or tea from a neighbor. The person borrowing the money gives a piece of paper called a mortgage to the lender, which states that if the money isn't paid back with interest, the lender can take the house as payment. It's like giving something valuable as security for a loan. In a conversation between Mr. Murphy and Mr. Bobbsey, Mr. Murphy mentions that Mr. Hardee borrowed money to buy lumber from Mr. Bobbsey but hasn't paid it back. Mr. Murphy plans to talk to Mr. Hardee and mentions foreclosing the mortgage if the money isn't repaid. In the end, Mr. Hardee decides to cut his wire fence to settle the debt.|"[""1.

Freddie proudly showed off his catch to the others, but he didn't have much luck fishing due to his impatience. To protect his fish from Snoop, Dinah provided a glass dish for it to swim in. Bert and Harry, who had caught bigger fish, returned to fishing, while Nan took over Freddie's pole. Flossie entertained herself with her doll and watched Freddie's fish.

Dinah was scared of ghosts on the boat, thinking they were responsible for the missing food. However, Nan knew better and believed there was a logical explanation. She suspected the dog, Snap, might have taken the sandwiches. But when Mrs. Bobbsey pointed out that Snap couldn't have entered through the window, they realized it must have been someone else. They concluded that it was likely some tramps who took the sandwiches. To prevent such incidents, Mr. Bobbsey decided to put wire netting over the windows. Later, the Bobbsey twins, along with their family and Dinah, went for a picnic in the woods with fresh sandwiches. Nan was still unsure about Snap's involvement in the mystery.|"['1.

Dorothy and her friends were exploring the beautiful woods. Dorothy, who lived by the seashore, rarely had the chance to visit forests, so she cherished every moment in the cool woods.

Despite the thunder and lightning, they managed to steer the boat to safety. The next morning, they found some damage from the storm, but everyone was safe.

Freddie mentioned that Snap, their dog, used to howl at the moon, which made strange noises. Mr. Bobbsey reassured his children not to fear the dark, explaining that many fears are just things they imagine. They investigated a passageway on the ship where they heard creaking noises, which Mr. Bobbsey attributed to the boat pulling on anchor ropes due to the wind. Despite the explanation, Dinah, the cook, thought it was a person crying. Eventually, they dismissed the ghost scare.
