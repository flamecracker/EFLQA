There was little danger in continuing the flight of the Mars airship. More gas had been automatically produced and added to the undamaged compartments, while some sand ballast had been released to balance the weight. Even though the craft was now operating with two propellers instead of three and had some torn parts of the gas bag trailing behind, Tom was pleased with the challenging conditions. As the airship rolled and seemed unstable, the crew members, not accustomed to such situations, expressed fear. Tom decided not to proceed with firing the guns as planned, noticing that the recoil was still too strong even after adjustments. Dropping bombs from an airship poses challenges, including precision in targeting and potential risks due to carrying explosives.

The law of gravity affecting falling objects is well understood. It changes depending on the height, but in general, an object falling freely towards the ground accelerates at a rate of thirty-two feet per second. This principle has been utilized by the French in the ongoing European conflict. They drop small steel darts from balloons or airplanes, sharpened like pencils. Released from a mile above, these darts gain enough speed to pierce a person from head to toe. When dropping bombs from aircraft, the timing of the explosion is crucial. Bomb-dropping competitions at airshows use balls filled with white powder to display accuracy. Tom, a young inventor, demonstrated how to release bombs accurately using instruments like a range-finder and speed calculator. Through a glass floor, observers could witness the chalk bombs being dropped and see the reaction of a surprised farmer below.|['1.

The damaged airship, despite the sabotage attempt, showed resilience as it sped towards Tom's home. Tom conducted experiments along the way, successfully addressing recoil issues and discovering the propeller sabotage. An acid-filled capsule had been surreptitiously placed in the propeller, weakening it over time. Lieutenant Marbury confirmed the sabotage. Though suspects were held, they denied involvement. Tom repaired the gas bag and resolved the gun recoil problem by adopting a German Zeppelin technique with dual barrels. Despite challenges, he worked tirelessly to implement the solution. As the group marveled at Tom's ingenuity, he shared his cautious approach to testing the new modifications over the ocean.|"['1.

"Tom cheerfully responded, ""Koku, you may serve breakfast now,"" as the giant served the meal with confidence. Unconcerned by the airship floating over the sea, Koku's trust in Tom was unwavering. The crew had breakfast while the aerial warship floated near the clouds, under the command of George Watson. Lieutenant Marbury expressed faith in Tom's gun solution, ensuring minimal recoil. To avoid endangering ships, they scanned the waters before testing the guns and bomb tubes. Tom released shells into the sea, demonstrating the absence of recoil. The Mars remained stable during the test, impressing all on board. After confirming rudder control, they headed back to Shopton successfully.

Extra precautions were taken regarding the shops. Strangers were not allowed to enter, and all future work on the Mars was kept secret. Despite Lieutenant Marbury assuring Tom of the success of his work, Tom was anxious about potential spoilage. The government official showed confidence in recommending the purchase of Tom's aerial warship. As the finishing touches were being made on the craft, Tom anxiously awaited signs of an approaching storm. Eventually, storm warnings were issued along the coast by the Weather Bureau in Washington. In the pilot-house of the Mars, Tom and Ned prepared to face the storm head-on. Ned expressed concern about the ship's endurance, but Tom remained confident in its strength and readiness for the challenge.

The chief engineer was puzzled by the sudden short-circuit that burned out the motor on the Mars, despite safety mechanisms in place. Tom Swift, the young inventor, discovered a hot copper bar near the damaged motor, which no one on the crew had placed. Even after a thorough search, no unauthorized person was found on board. Tom considered the possibility of a ghostly presence causing the malfunction. The Mars was safely navigated above the storm and back to Shopton, where a guard was stationed to investigate further, but no answers were found.
