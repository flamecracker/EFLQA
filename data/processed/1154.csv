"Once upon a time, I befriended Matthew Mugg, the cat's-meat-man, who had a peculiar squint but a kind heart. He roamed Puddleby, knowing every dog and cat, offering meat on skewers to pet owners. Accompanying him was a delight as he called out, ""Meat! M-E-A-T!"" and animals flocked to him. Matthew shared his wisdom on dogs and introduced me to various breeds. Alongside his cat's-meat trade, he excelled in rat-catching and even had prize-winning dogs. Despite not attending school due to financial constraints, I reveled in nature, collecting eggs, fishing, and exploring.

Matthew excitedly spoke about his friend, Doctor John Dolittle, a remarkable man who understood animal languages and communicated with them. He lived alone except for his pets and had made incredible discoveries during his voyages. Matthew shared that the Doctor had found a tribe of Red Indians living on separate islands, meeting only once a year for a feast. Despite his amazing abilities, the Doctor kept his talent a secret because people would laugh at the idea. He even wrote books in animal languages and was learning to communicate with shellfish.

When we arrived at the house, Matthew headed up the steps to the front gate, and I followed. I thought he was going into the garden, but the gate was locked. A dog from the house ran down, and he took pieces of meat and bags of corn and bran that the cat's-meat-man handed through the bars. Instead of eating, the dog carried everything back to the house and vanished. Matthew explained that the items were provisions for the pets in the Doctor's house. Jip, the dog, was getting old and stayed behind to care for the house while the Doctor was away. Matthew visited twice a week to feed Jip. I went back home, tucking my squirrel into a cozy box, eagerly awaiting the Doctor's return. Each day, I checked the gate to see if it was open, signaling the Doctor's presence.|"['1.

After finishing my snack, I thanked the Colonel's wife and left. Before heading home, I decided to check if the Doctor had returned. I had already visited his house that morning, but I wanted to make sure everything was okay. My squirrel wasn't improving, and I was getting worried. When I reached the gate, it was still locked, leaving me feeling disheartened. I had been coming here daily for a week. Jip, the dog, greeted me but made sure I didn't enter. Wondering about the time, I saw the Colonel approaching. When I asked him for the time, he rudely refused.

He grasped my hand, and we sprinted down the road together. I pondered about the identity and dwelling of this peculiar man. Despite being strangers, he guided me to his home for shelter, a stark contrast to the unhelpful Colonel. As we halted, I gazed around and recognized the house with the vast garden. The man swiftly ascended the steps, unlocking the gate with his keys. I had envisioned someone grand, yet this small, friendly man defied expectations.

As I gazed up the staircase, I strained to discern the approaching figure. The peculiar sound of a single foot hopping down the steps reached my ears, perplexing me.

The Doctor, clad in bespoke boots crafted by my father, guided me to change into dry attire. After lighting candles throughout the house, we ascended to retrieve old garments from a wardrobe.

The kitchen described was cozy and warm, making it a delightful place to enjoy meals.

At that moment, we heard someone running behind us. Jip the dog was sprinting down the road towards us, clearly excited. Upon reaching us, he barked and whined in a peculiar way, prompting the Doctor to engage with him animatedly. Soon, the Doctor's face lit up with joy.

The parrot expressed her disdain for animal doctors, claiming that only real doctors could truly understand animals.

The garden was a paradise with vast lawns, stone seats, and weeping-willows brushing the grass. Yew hedges lined the paths like old town streets, leading to doorways shaped like vases and peacocks. A marble fish-pond held golden carp and frogs, while a brick wall bore ripe peaches. A hollow oak hid secrets, and numerous summer-houses invited exploration. An outdoor fireplace and a couch under the stars added charm. A tiny tree-house in an elm tree enchanted visitors. Birds, nests, stoats, tortoises, and toads roamed freely. The Doctor assured that the creatures were harmless, even enjoying music. The garden was a haven, offering endless discoveries and peace—a true Garden of Dreams.|['1.

"""Yes,"" the Doctor explained, ""in my zoo, every door has a lock, but they open from the inside. The locks are for the animals to retreat from others or visitors.

The next day, I sat in the Doctor's garden, chatting with Dab-Dab the duck. Thanks to Polynesia's teachings, I could now converse with birds and some animals easily. Dab-Dab, a kind old bird, shared tales of the Doctor's African adventures. As we watched sheep heading to market, cheers from afar caught our attention. A crowd of schoolchildren trailed a peculiar, ragged woman. Her long arms and hunched shoulders stood out, and her attire was eccentric. With a hat askew and a dragging skirt, she seemed comical. Despite her obscured face, her dark, hairy hands hinted at an enigmatic persona. The children's laughter filled the air as they followed the strange figure down the road.|"['Question 1:\nWhat skill did the narrator learn from Polynesia?\nA) Gardening\nB) Cooking\nC) Conversing with birds and some animals\nD) Painting\nE) Swimming', ""Question 2:\nWho was the narrator chatting with in the Doctor's garden?\nA) A sheep\nB) A schoolchild\nC) A lion\nD) Dab-Dab the duck\nE) A monkey"", 'Question 3:\nWhat caught the attention of the narrator and Dab-Dab while chatting in the garden?\nA) A circus performance\nB) A market\nC) A parade\nD) A concert\nE) A race', ""Question 4:\nHow did the peculiar woman's attire make her appear?\nA) Elegant\nB) Scary\nC) Comical\nD) Mysterious\nE) Boring"", 'Question 5:\nWhat did the children do as they followed the strange figure down the road?\nA) Sang songs\nB) Played games\nC) Danced\nD) Laughed\nE) Slept', 'Question 6:\nWhat characteristic of the peculiar woman hinted at her enigmatic persona?\nA) Her bright smile\nB) Her loud voice\nC) Her colorful clothes\nD) Her dark, hairy hands\nE) Her friendly demeanor']"|['C) Conversing with birds and some animals', 'D) Dab-Dab the duck', 'B) A market', 'C) Comical', 'D) Laughed', 'D) Her dark, hairy hands']
The peculiar sight of a monkey in a straw hat chasing children down the street caught the attention of the onlookers. The children, frightened by the monkey's aggressive behavior, ran back to town as fast as they could. The monkey, known as Chee-Chee, climbed over a gate with remarkable dexterity, using its feet as hands. As Chee-Chee entered the garden, it began to shed its clothes in a frenzy. Concerned for the monkey, the Doctor instructed Stubbins to fetch peanuts and bananas to appease Chee-Chee's hunger. Chee-Chee's longing for the Doctor and the home in Puddleby led it to sneak onto a ship bound for England by disguising itself in human clothing.

When the monkey disguised as a girl reached England, the sailors mistook him for a pet and tried to keep him. However, he managed to escape and journeyed across England to Puddleby. Along the way, he faced many challenges. Children chased him, people tried to catch him, and he had to sleep in ditches and barns, surviving on berries and nuts. Finally, after numerous adventures, he spotted Puddleby Church's tower, signaling his return home. Exhausted, he expressed his discomfort with the girl's clothes he wore. Once back in the familiar house, Chee-Chee, the monkey, climbed up to sleep on the plate-rack like a sailor.

In the courtroom, the atmosphere was serious and impressive. The room was grand with a high ceiling. The Judge, an elderly and distinguished man in a large gray wig and black robe, sat at his desk on a raised platform. Below him, lawyers in white wigs were seated at a long desk. The setting resembled a mix of a church and a school. The Doctor explained that the area where witnesses stand is called the witness-box. He left to speak with a lawyer, instructing the protagonist to hold their seats with Bob. The Judge used a small wooden hammer to silence the room, and another man in a black gown began reading a legal document.

During the trial, the courtroom buzzed with excitement. Witnesses took turns in the witness-box, answering questions about the events of the night of the 29th. The Prosecutor tried to paint the Hermit in a bad light, asking questions that insinuated he was a bad man. Luke, the accused, seemed disinterested except when a man named Mendoza took the stand. Luke's dog, Bob, was brought forward as a witness to shed light on the events. The Judge allowed the Doctor to communicate with Bob to understand his testimony. The courtroom was filled with whispers and giggles as the Doctor and Bob conversed in their unique way. Eventually, Bob testified about overhearing a plot to kill the Hermit for his gold.

Bob recounted the tale of how he tried to warn his master about dangerous partners who planned harm. Unable to communicate in human language, Bob stayed close to his master day and night. The partners used a bucket and rope to go down the mine, hauling each other and the gold up. One evening, Bob's master was pulling up a partner, mistaken for a bucket of gold by a man named Mendoza. Seeing the danger, Bob bit his master's leg to make him let go of the rope, causing the partner to fall and die. Mendoza, planning to frame Bob's master, fled. Fearing the police, Bob and his master escaped to England, where they hid for fifteen years. The jury was moved by Bob's testimony, and the lawyer, unable to counter the truth, left the courtroom defeated.|"[""1.

The judge gave a long speech to the jury. Then the twelve jurors left the room. The Doctor returned with Bob, sitting next to me. Everyone was silent as the jurors returned.

In the dimly lit room, Dab-Dab guarded the imprisoned Cheapside. A stunning bird named Miranda, with a violet breast, scarlet wings, and a golden tail, perched on the ink-stand, looking exhausted. Dab-Dab whispered to the Doctor, asking to send away the mischievous sparrow. Cheapside, the sparrow, complained about Miranda, calling her a gaudy foreigner.

She shared that Long Arrow was last seen heading into the mountains in search of rare plants. Miranda mentioned encountering a storm while flying to relay the news, barely surviving by resting on a piece of a wrecked vessel. The Doctor, deeply saddened by the news, feared the loss of Long Arrow's vast knowledge. He had planned to meet Long Arrow to learn more about natural science and the language of shellfish.

It was an exciting and nerve-wracking moment. With our eyes tightly closed, I heard the atlas fall open with a loud bang. I pondered whether it was the map of England or Asia. The fate of our adventure depended on where the pencil would land. After waving three times in a circle, I slowly lowered my hand. The tip of the pencil made contact with the page, revealing a map titled _Chart of the South Atlantic Ocean_. The pencil had landed right in the center of a small island named _Spidermonkey Island_. The Doctor, needing his glasses to read the tiny print, was astonished. He mentioned that it was the very island where Long Arrow was last seen. The Doctor expressed his amazement at the coincidence and the opportunity to study rare Jabizri beetles found only on Spidermonkey Island.

Polynesia instructed everyone to remove loose food items and thin down the able seaman, Ben Butcher, who had eaten a lot of provisions. They watched as Bumpo rang the dinner bell to trick Ben Butcher into thinking it was mealtime. Polynesia admired her own sea knowledge compared to Ben Butcher's, and they decided Bumpo would serve meals while they figured out how to replenish supplies. They discovered Ben Butcher had consumed more than just beef, leaving them with limited options. The Doctor considered selling his broken watch but knew it wouldn't fetch much. Bumpo suggested singing for money, but the Doctor doubted the locals would appreciate African music. Despite the urgency to leave, they stayed to watch the upcoming bullfight in the old, narrow streets of Monteverde, a town known for its Sunday bullfights.|['1.

When we had no money, we couldn't afford a hotel. However, on the second evening, passing a bed-maker's shop, we saw beds displayed outside. The Doctor conversed with the bed-maker in Spanish, bonding over birds. Invited for supper, we happily accepted. After enjoying a meal cooked in olive oil, we chatted late into the night. Concerned about poorly lit streets, the shopkeeper insisted we stay the night. With no spare rooms, we slept on the beds outside.

"""Rarely do bullfights happen,"" he mentioned. ""Bulls may seem fierce, but they aren't as dangerous as one might think, especially if you're agile and keep a level head. Bullfighters are skilled and quick, admired by many, especially the Spanish ladies. A famed bullfighter, or matador, holds more importance in Spain than even a king.

The next day in Monteverde was bustling with excitement. The Doctor was set to challenge the renowned Pepito de Malaga in a bullfight. As we made our way to the bull-ring, the streets were adorned with flags and lively crowds. Despite the locals finding the Doctor's challenge amusing, he was determined to win. The Doctor, dressed in a borrowed bullfighter's suit, looked quite splendid, even though the outfit struggled to contain his ample size. Upon arriving at the bull-ring, the Doctor inspected the bulls and shared his plans with them. The bulls, eager to be part of a fight that might end bullfighting, agreed to cooperate. The event began with much skepticism from the audience, but as the fight progressed, it became apparent that Pepito's tactics were more about showmanship than true danger, with his assistant diverting the bulls' attention when needed.|"['1.

After roughly ten minutes, the small door to the matadors’ changing area swung open, and the Doctor casually entered the arena. The crowd burst into laughter at the sight of his plump figure clad in sky-blue velvet. Known as Juan Hagapoco, he walked to the ring's center, bowing first to the ladies in the boxes, then to the bull, and finally to Pepito. Suddenly, the bull charged at him from behind. Surprisingly, the bull's pace slowed as if intimidated by the Doctor's stern expression, eventually halting altogether and fleeing with its tail between its legs. The Doctor chased after the bull, showcasing extraordinary feats like making the bull kneel and performing acrobatics on its horns. Pepito and his assistant grew envious as the crowd marveled at the Doctor's unconventional approach to bullfighting.

The Spaniard initially tried to appear brave, but the charging bulls were too much for him. He fled over the fence in fear, disappearing from sight.

Dr. Dolittle, despite being busy, spent his spare time writing in his notebooks. These notebooks were filled with notes and sketches of sea creatures like seaweeds, sea birds, worms, and seashells. One day, while sailing on the _Curlew_, they encountered gulf-weed floating around them. The Doctor explained that it covered the water, making it look like a meadow. They saw crabs crawling on the weed, which reminded the Doctor of his dream to understand shellfish language. He caught a fish called a Silver Fidgit and discovered it could speak English and whistle tunes. Excited, he tried to establish communication with the fish.

In the middle of the night, I dozed off in a chair while Bumpo fell asleep at the helm of the _Curlew_. For hours, the ship drifted freely.

Excitedly, he revealed to me that he had unlocked the key to the fidgit's language. The fidgit agreed to share its life story, starting with its birth in the Pacific Ocean near Chile. The fidgit narrated a perilous escape from whales, followed by a frantic swim to flee dog-fish, fierce predators.

The next morning, two fidgits were discovered by the keeper floating lifeless in their tank.

The fidgits were spared from being thrown into an ash-barrel or the gutter as the keeper was stopped by a man in blue with silver buttons.

We were free to race home, laughing and shouting with joy, leaving behind the troubles of the Giant Shellfish. The Fidgit shared tales of the Deep Hole near the Amazon River and another in the Antarctic Sea. The Doctor, eager to study the sea's depths, sought the help of the enormous salt-water snail with a transparent shell. This snail, the last of its kind, could carry them safely into the ocean's depths. However, the snail rarely ventured out of the Deep Hole, a muddy and fearsome place for ordinary fish.

At first, we weren't concerned, thinking the wind would return. Days passed, but the breeze remained weak. The Doctor, anxious, checked his sextant and maps. Despite having enough food, he fretted about delays. He worried about the Purple Bird-of-Paradise waiting in the Peruvian mountains. The wind shifted erratically, hinting at a storm. The sky darkened, and the sea turned gray. The Doctor prepared for bad weather, fearing the fierce gales. As the storm approached, the crew hurried to secure the ship.

I was scared. Until then, I had only seen the sea in peaceful moments. Now, it showed its angry side. The wind was fierce, the water blinding, and the noise deafening. Our ship was in trouble. Waves crashed over us, making us feel like we were sinking. I tried to reach the Doctor but was thrown by a wave, hitting my head hard. When I woke up, I was tied to a broken mast on a piece of the ship. I was alone in the vast ocean. I was worried about the Doctor and the others. Where were they? I cut the rope and tried to make sense of the situation. I saw a Stormy Petrel, a bird flying nearby, but I couldn't communicate with it. I feared the worst for my companions.|['1.

Once, a petrel gracefully circled my raft, unfazed by the storm. Despite my distress, I marveled at its resilience. The small bird, weaker than me, seemed at ease in the vast sea. It made me realize that size and strength aren't everything. Alone and hungry, I pondered my fate, fearing starvation or thirst. As loneliness crept in, I longed for the Doctor's company. The petrel, also alone, faced the sea with ease. I envied the Doctor's courage and hoped for rescue. Days passed until a kind albatross revealed the Doctor's safety.

I stood at the back of the raft and peered into the water. Just below, four large porpoises swam, their sleek bodies shining in the moonlight, nudging the raft with their noses. Miranda explained they were friends of Doctor Dolittle and loyal to him. Soon, we spotted the Doctor's party in the distance. Even though my eyes couldn't catch all the details, I heard Bumpo singing and saw the remains of the ship _Curlew_ floating nearby. As we reunited with the Doctor, I was comforted by his presence and his ability to navigate the sea like the Stormy Petrel. Despite the shipwreck and losing most of his possessions, the Doctor remained cheerful. He led us towards Spidermonkey Island, showing resilience and resourcefulness by salvaging his precious notebooks.

Our journey to Spidermonkey Island was met with the challenge of the increasing cold due to the island drifting southward from its usual path. Despite the cold, poor Miranda returned nearly frozen, warning us of the island's proximity. As dawn broke, we glimpsed the land with withered trees and grasses, suffering from the unfamiliar climate. Upon landing, we encountered Red Indians who seemed wary of our presence, armed with bows and arrows. The Doctor attempted to communicate our peaceful intentions, but they remained hostile until they departed upon receiving a message.

In the dense and tangled woods at the base of the hills, we faced the challenge of navigating through the thick undergrowth. Following Polynesia's advice, we avoided well-trodden paths to steer clear of encountering any locals. Despite the tricky terrain, Polynesia and Chee-Chee proved to be excellent guides and skilled hunters, quickly foraging a variety of unfamiliar fruits and nuts for our sustenance. Discovering a pristine stream originating from the mountains provided us with refreshing water. As we ascended towards higher ground, the forest thinned, offering glimpses of breathtaking island vistas and the vast blue sea beyond. Dr. Dolittle's excitement peaked upon spotting a rare Jabizri beetle, capturing it with sheer determination despite the risk of a near-fall. His expertise in handling the beetle revealed a mysterious leaf wrapped around its leg, sparking curiosity and admiration among us.|"['1.

Our amazement peaked when we discovered the leaf's interior adorned with intricate signs and minuscule drawings. Some signs remained a mystery, but the images were clear, depicting men and mountains. The illustrations were sketched in a peculiar brown ink, leading the Doctor to suspect it was blood due to its color when dry. The Doctor recognized it as a picture letter, a message conveyed through a beetle, specifically a rare Jabizri beetle. The drawings portrayed men climbing a mountain, entering a cave, a mountain collapsing, men indicating hunger, praying, and appearing sick. The Doctor deciphered the plea for help in the message, urging immediate action to rescue those trapped underground. The urgency to respond to the distress call spurred them to embark on a mission to aid the stranded individuals.|"[""1.

When Long Arrow turned to the newcomers and told them in their own language that it was the white man who had found and freed their relatives, they gathered round John Dolittle, all talking at once and beating their breasts. Long Arrow said they were apologizing and trying to tell the Doctor how sorry they were that they had seemed unfriendly to him at the beach. They had never seen a white man before and had really been afraid of him—especially when they saw him conversing with the porpoises. They had thought he was the Devil, they said. Travelers who have since visited Spidermonkey Island tell me that that huge stone slab is now one of the regular sights of the island. And that the Indian guides, when showing it to visitors, always tell their story of how it came there. They say that when the Doctor found that the rocks had entrapped his friend, Long Arrow, he was so angry that he ripped the mountain in halves with his bare hands and let him out. FROM that time on the Indians’ treatment of us was very different. We were invited to their village for a feast to celebrate the recovery of the lost families. And after we had made a litter from saplings to carry the sick woman in, we all started off down the mountain.

The warm welcome we received in the village was truly remarkable. Despite the chilly evening, the villagers emerged from their homes in large numbers, surrounding us with smiles and gestures of gratitude as Long Arrow recounted our deeds. As we passed through the village, we noticed a grand house at the end of the main street, now vacant due to the absence of a new chief. Inside, a feast awaited us, with the tribe's leaders already gathered at the table. To our surprise, the fish was served raw as the villagers were unfamiliar with cooking over a fire. The Doctor realized the villagers lacked the knowledge of making fire and taught Long Arrow through drawings. A desperate mother sought the Doctor's help for her sick baby, prompting the Doctor to explain fire-making methods that required daylight. Long Arrow, however, assured them that his people could navigate in the dark and promised to fetch the necessary materials for fire-making.|"['1.

The Doctor, with the help of Long Arrow and the Indians, created fire in the dark using a squirrel's nest and wood. The room was lit up as the fire blazed, fascinating the Indians. They learned to cook fish over the fire and were delighted by the smell of fried fish. The tribe gathered around the bonfire, warming themselves and marveling at the fire's warmth. The Doctor then showed them how to take fire into their huts, bringing warmth to every home in the village. The Popsipetels were grateful for the fire, staying up late talking about the Doctor's magical abilities. The Doctor's popularity required him to work in secret to avoid constant attention. In addition to helping the plants and trees, they also found that the animals were suffering in the cold, with birds seeking warmer lands and land-crabs heading to the sea for a better habitat.|"[""1.

The Doctor and his animal friends were on a floating island drifting southward due to a current. Concerned about the island's journey to the icy south, the Doctor asked the porpoises for help. The porpoises agreed to seek out other animals to aid in pushing the island back to safety near Southern Brazil. The Doctor learned that the island was once part of South America, breaking off and filling with air, making it float. With a plan in motion to save the island, the Doctor felt relieved and warmer, eager to eat. As they headed back, the Doctor and Long Arrow discussed plants until news arrived of an impending attack by the Bag-jagderags on the neighboring Popsipetels, setting the stage for a new adventure.|"[""1.

"""It's terrible news,"" the Doctor said solemnly. ""But let's not rush to judgment. Maybe they're desperate for food, their crops ruined by frost.

The bamboo fence around the town was flimsy and kept collapsing as the enemy attacked. The Doctor, Long Arrow, and Bumpo fought bravely, but the enemy kept breaking through. Even as the Three fought valiantly, the overwhelming numbers of the Bag-jagderags proved too much. Long Arrow fell with a spear in his chest, the Doctor fought fiercely, and Bumpo was hit by a stone. John Dolittle was left alone, with Jip and the narrator trying to help. However, the mob overwhelmed them, and they were knocked down.

During the fierce battle, a terrifying noise filled the air: millions of furious parrots screeching. Polynesia had summoned an army of sixty to seventy million parrots from South America, darkening the western sky. These black parrots, with scarlet beaks, attacked the Bag-jagderags by clipping their ears, causing them to flee in pain. Even though the parrots' bites were painful, they only targeted the ears, leaving a unique mark on the defeated Bag-jagderags. Despite the Doctor's anger towards the attackers, the victory was won without many serious injuries. The defeated Bag-jagderags fled as the parrots threatened from above. The next day, the group left for the far end of the island by sea, leaving the City of Bag-jagderag behind.|['1.

Leaving our canoes, we walked up the main street to the chief's palace. Bumpo and I smiled as we saw the crowds bowing to the Doctor, who strutted ahead with pride. At the palace steps, the chief and important tribe members greeted him warmly, but the Doctor ignored them. Inside, he scolded the tribe, calling them names and threatening to let parrots drive them into the sea. He then had a scribe write the terms of peace on the palace walls, known as _The Peace of The Parrots_. Despite his harsh words, the tribe admired him. As he left, they begged him to stay, offering riches. The Doctor declined, emphasizing the importance of honesty and good governance.

Some of the leaders spoke to the Popsipetels as we departed. Although their words were unclear to me, we noticed several canoes filled with Bag-jagderags following us at a safe distance back to Popsipetel. As we set off, we spotted a steep point on the coast where the sea churned with frothy waves. Approaching closer, we realized our loyal whales were nudging us northward. We had been so engrossed in the war that we had forgotten about them. Watching their powerful tails churn the sea, we felt a warmth despite the cold. Speeding up our boat to prevent losing sight of the island, we continued along the coast. Eventually, we landed halfway to Popsipetel and explored the heart of the island. The Indian paddlers guided us to the mountains, where they revealed the Whispering Rocks—a unique amphitheater-like formation with a table of rock and an ivory chair at the center. This was where the kings of Spidermonkey Island were crowned in the past. The guides also showed us a massive hanging stone perched on a volcano's crater, believed to hold a legend that it would fall into the volcano when the greatest king was crowned, causing the island to sink.|"['1.

Bumpo and the crew were discussing the possibility of an island sinking in the sea. Bumpo feared it might fall through the world. As they returned to the shore, they noticed the Bag-jagderags following them. The villagers were up all night for a chief's election. The new chief's name was to be revealed at mid-day. After checking on Long Arrow, the crew rested but was awakened by music. The whole village had gathered around their house, dressed in colorful attire.

In the quiet of the Whispering Rocks, where not even a pin-drop could be heard, the Indian families displayed totem-poles outside their homes. These totem-poles were like door-plates, showcasing the family's qualities and deeds through carved animals.

The loud sound broke the quietness with the noise of a hundred cannons. In a place where even a soft sound could travel far, the impact was strong. The mountains echoed the noise back and forth. The echoes seemed never-ending as they rumbled through the island, reverberating in the lower valleys and booming in the distant sea caves. Suddenly, the old man pointed to the highest mountain, and as I turned, I saw the Hanging Stone slowly disappear into the volcano. After a long minute, we heard a distant thud followed by hissing air. The Doctor, looking anxious, sat down, watching the ocean. The island began to sink slowly, the sea creeping over the beaches. Thankfully, it settled gently on the sandy bottom. Although some houses were underwater, everyone was safe, watching King Jong's coronation. The Doctor, busy from morning till night, worked hard to build the new town, New Popsipetel, teaching the Indians new ways to improve their lives.|"['1.

John Dolittle, a kind and wise man, landed on an island where people didn't use fire or have metals. Determined to help, he discovered iron and copper mines in the mountains. With patience and care, he taught the locals how to melt and shape these metals into useful tools like knives and plows. Despite his reluctance to be a king, the islanders insisted on grandeur, demanding a magnificent palace and elaborate ceremonies. The Doctor, as they called him, embraced his role, settling disputes, teaching school, and even wearing uncomfortable royal attire. His dedication to his people made Popsipetel a well-governed kingdom, admired for its fairness and prosperity. The islanders celebrated his birthday with joy and festivity, honoring the humble man who became a great king.|['1.

At the end of the day, the leaders of the two tribes paraded through the town with a beautifully painted ebony tablet, ten feet tall. This tablet depicted the history of the ancient kings of Popsipetel through pictures and verses. It was placed with great ceremony above the entrance of the new palace. The tablet celebrated six significant events in King Jong's life, each accompanied by verses composed by the Court Poet. The community gathered around to admire the artwork, reflecting on the king's accomplishments. Inside the Royal Palace, the Doctor and his friends had their own rooms, where they often discussed plans and state affairs. On this particular evening, they longed for English food and cocoa with whipped cream, reminiscing about their favorite treats from back home.|"[""1.

The study of plants, known as botany, was not something that initially intrigued me. I found it less captivating compared to the study of animals. However, as Long Arrow shared his collection of plants and their unique qualities, my interest grew. I was completely engrossed in the wonders of the Vegetable Kingdom that he presented. When Bumpo mistakenly consumed some seeds, the effects were remarkable. He laughed uncontrollably, and we had to put him to bed. Long Arrow also showed us red roots that could make people dance with incredible speed when made into a soup. Despite his offer, we declined after Bumpo's incident. Long Arrow's collection included various items like hair growth oil, a giant orange, black honey for sleep, and more with extraordinary properties. The Doctor was fascinated and noted down their details. The Doctor realized the potential of these discoveries in the field of medicine and chemistry. Despite the pleasant life on Spidermonkey Island, thoughts of England and his old life lingered in the Doctor's mind. He remained absorbed in caring for his family, but an accident and Polynesia would soon change his course.|"[""1.

That morning, we observed the Doctor overseeing the construction of a new theater in Popsipetel. The Doctor grew irritated and upset at the sight, prompting me to suggest a walk to clear her mind. She expressed concern about the Doctor's lack of interest in natural history since receiving news that his pets were well cared for. We pondered ways to reignite his passion for nature. Suddenly, a giant pink shell emerged from the sea, resembling a sea serpent. Polynesia recognized it as a rare sea snail and urged me to stay put while she fetched the Doctor. Mesmerized by the creature, I watched as it moved gently in the water, revealing its long neck and horns. The sight was both mesmerizing and puzzling, hinting at a potential adventure ahead.|"[""1.

Dr. Dolittle and his animal friends made a surprising discovery on the beach. They found the Great Glass Sea-snail, a rare and magnificent creature, resting there. The Doctor was thrilled by this unexpected encounter. The porpoises shared with him the snail's unusual journey to the shore. It turned out that the island had unknowingly trapped the snail in the Deep Hole, causing him to struggle and sprain his tail. Now, seeking peace and healing, the snail had come ashore.

Doctor Dolittle sat on the shore, waiting patiently after the island had been accidentally lowered. The Doctor wanted to help a snail that got hurt due to the incident. Porpoises brought sea creatures to assist, and a starfish acted as an interpreter for the snail.

Dr. Dolittle asked Stubbins to go to the town and inform the workers to stop building the theatre for the day. Then, he requested him to proceed to the palace to retrieve his medicine bag from under the throne in the Audience Chamber. Upon returning with the bag, Stubbins found the snail on the beach, resembling a sea-serpent due to its size. The Doctor examined a swelling on the snail's tail and treated it with embrocation and bandages. When the bandages were not long enough, they used sheets from the Royal Linen-closet torn into strips. Dr. Dolittle suggested taking turns to watch over the snail, with Bumpo being a suitable candidate.
