Long ago, a King and Queen wished for a child. Finally, a daughter was born. They invited seven Fairies to bless her, but one was forgotten. The angry Fairy cursed the Princess to prick her finger on a spindle and die. A kind Fairy changed the curse to a hundred years of sleep, broken by a Prince's kiss. The curse came true when the Princess pricked her finger and slept for a century. The Prince found her, woke her with a kiss, and ended the spell. They married and celebrated. The tale of Sleeping Beauty teaches us about kindness, curses, and true love prevailing.|"['1.
