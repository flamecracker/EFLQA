"Believe in Jesus for Salvation

To be saved, it's not just about knowing the truth like the devils do; it's about believing in Christ Jesus. He offers to be our Savior, promising rest to those who come to Him. Imagine being stranded on a bayou with no way to swim, but finding a plank to cling to for life. That's how we must rely on Jesus, trusting in Him alone for eternal life. He will cleanse our sins with His blood and clothe us in His righteousness. We can't earn salvation with our deeds; we must trust in Jesus' righteousness.

The desire for power by a few deceitful individuals may lead them to create false reasons to achieve their ambitions. They spread lies about slavery being abolished and incite fear of insurrection to gain control. However, the real intention is to deceive and manipulate the masses for personal gain. The framers of the constitution aimed for gradual emancipation to eliminate slavery, but extreme abolitionists hindered this progress. The political climate during 1860-'61 was tense and uncertain as states seceded, and conflicts escalated. The fall of Fort Sumter marked the beginning of a devastating war. Families were torn apart as loved ones enlisted on opposing sides, fearing the worst as the nation descended into chaos.|"['1.

In the scorching July sun of 1864, a pine forest held a stockade where thousands of prisoners were trapped. The stockade was guarded by armed sentinels, and a deadly line marked the boundary where any prisoner who crossed it would be shot. The prisoners suffered from lack of water, shelter, and food. The only water source was contaminated, leading to sickness and death. Every morning, a wagon collected the bodies of the deceased to be buried in a mass grave. Many prisoners were on the brink of death, some in despair, others driven to madness by hunger.
