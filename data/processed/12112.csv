Tubby Hopkins noticed Jack Curtiss seemed upset about not having his own Boy Scout patrol. Despite Jack's threats, Tubby teased him about joining their group.

The boys were excited about the upcoming motor-boat races at Hampton's inlet.

"Rob piloted the Flying Fish toward the floating landing, connected by a sloping runway from the wharf. Skipper rushed down to board as soon as he saw what was happening. Captain Job welcomed him with a grateful bark. ""I wouldn't lose that dog for all the money in Rob's father's bank,"" Captain Job declared. The boys learned that Jack Curtiss and his friends had been using the island as a meeting place, which was unwelcome news as the boys had plans for a camp there.

Jack Curtiss and his friend quickly overcame their hesitation when the hydroplane lurched dangerously. Dressed lightly in canvas trousers and sleeveless jerseys, they easily swam to the Flying Fish. As they jumped into the water, Merritt swiftly removed his jacket and shoes to rescue a drowning boy named Sam. Despite Sam's panicked grip, Merritt managed to free himself and strike Sam to loosen his hold. The Flying Fish crew helped Sam recover from swallowing seawater. Later, Merritt was praised for his bravery by Mr. Wingate, the Yacht Club commodore. Sam, after being saved, realized his mistake in underestimating the sea's danger.

"Hold on a moment,"" he yelled, as the crowd started to cheer and jeer. ""There's one more thing to say. The group has chosen to provide an extra prize of five dollars to Thomas Maloney, whose model displays commendable and thorough work.""

The two boys used oars to create a makeshift shelter on their boat during a storm. They faced danger and difficulty as the boat leaped over waves. Eventually, they managed to secure the canvas cover to break the waves. They used a bait tub, boat hook, and broom to create a makeshift sail to steer the boat back to shore. The storm passed, and the waves calmed down. However, they were far from land with no means to navigate back. The boys improvised a sail using the canvas cover and oars.

Jack mocked Hank for being scared and leaving little Joe Digby locked up in a deserted bungalow on an island. Hank bragged about securing the place tightly. Later, a note was found demanding $200 under the signpost at Montauk crossroads for Joe's return. Jack suggested Hank deliver the note and retrieve the money, but Hank felt he deserved a share for his past deeds. The group debated how to split the reward, with Hank insisting on a fair share. Hank reminded Jack of previous favors and threatened to reveal their misdeeds if not compensated.|"['1.

"""We must fend for ourselves now. This area will soon be too hot to stay. I plan to head out West to my cousin's ranch. I think I'll manage fine there if things get tough,"" Jack explained. Bill interrupted sharply, ""If you don't like it, tough luck. Hank and I outvote you. You chump,"" he muttered to Hank, ""he's taking all the blame. It's easy for us to escape if needed.""

Andy began by explaining to Rob that they found a boat keel mark and footprints on the beach, indicating someone had been there. Rob suspected their rivals were involved and questioned the broken shoes. They decided to investigate the Upper Inlet, a remote area with islands. The captain armed himself, eager for the adventure. They quickly prepared the Flying Fish and set off. Rob navigated cautiously through the shallow waters. Upon reaching the Upper Inlet, they spotted the island where the rivals had camped, but it was deserted. A piece of blotting paper in the tent hinted at Jack's presence. Despite the disappointment, they remained determined to find Joe.|"['1.

Rob, Merritt, and the rest of the group were puzzled by the mysterious disappearance of Joe. Rob, with his scouting skills, noticed something peculiar about the footprints near the tent. As they examined the tracks, they realized that Joe was taken by the group that left the camp. Suddenly, they saw smoke signals coming from the bungalow. The boys quickly rowed back to investigate. When they reached the bungalow, they knocked on the door. A loud explosion followed by splintering wood revealed that Joe had been locked inside. Joe explained that he used a smoke signal and Morse code to alert them about his whereabouts.

"""I'm not sure,"" the young boy replied, ""I recognize one of them—the man with the beard. The other two had masks, but I think they sounded like Bill and Jack. I'm positive about the one with the beard."" The Boy Scouts quickly sprinted to their boat and raced towards the Flying Fish. Despite their speed, the other boat managed to turn and speed away. Rob, determined, steered the Flying Fish, but she couldn't keep up due to her heavy load. Jack Curtiss taunted them from the other boat as they sped away effortlessly. Suddenly, Rob fired a warning shot that missed, causing panic in the other boat. Although they were scared, the boys realized they were safe. Rob continued the chase, even when stuck on a sandbar. They decided to head to Hampton to reunite Joe with his worried parents. Upon arrival, they were greeted by Mr. Wingate, Mr. Blake, and Merritt's father, who were relieved to see Joe safe.

Mr. Blake calmly explained how the knowledge of the Morse code, a skill every Boy Scout must possess, saved a boy who was trapped on an island. This revelation softened his previous animosity towards the Boy Scouts. He recounted a past incident where a trick to win an aeroplane model contest was exposed by the son, leading to subsequent trouble. The group then set out to apprehend two troublemakers who tried to extort money from Mr. Digby. The car raced to a train station where the culprits were attempting to escape. Despite the pursuit, the train departed before they could be caught. Mr. Blake suggested that the boys should be left to face the consequences of their actions to spare their families from public disgrace.

As Andy's call faded, the scouts emerged from their tents into a misty morning on the Atlantic coast. The captain, puffing on his pipe, emphasized the importance of being well-fed for a successful journey. Rob shared that a former bully had reformed, but denied involvement in a kidnapping. The mist thickened, making navigation hazardous. The captain expressed concern about ships straying near the Long Island shoals in fog. The boys boarded a cattle ship, meeting Mr. Harkness and his son from a Western ranch. They learned about a grizzly bear named Silver Tip that had eluded capture. The group marveled at the wireless room and Hiram sending a distress signal.|"['1.
