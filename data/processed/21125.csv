Can anything other than God's power transform a morally upright person, once proud of their own righteousness, into humility like that of a child, relying solely on the cross of Christ for salvation? The one who accomplishes this can do even more. What are the sins and self-will of the human heart compared to the immense power of Jehovah's majesty? The same being who laid the foundations of the earth and orchestrated the movements of the stars can shape the soul of a person as desired. Let us not hesitate, timid and discouraged by the sins that tarnish the image of our Maker in humanity. Instead, let us confidently approach the throne of grace, interceding for those who have strayed, especially our loved ones who, like the prodigal son, have wandered far from the Father's house.
