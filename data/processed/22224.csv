With the knowledge of geography we have, it's astounding to think that both Bonaparte and the French authorities believed they could march an army through Syria, Persia, and the northern borders of India to expel the British. Even if unopposed, the march would have been immense. The warlike chiefs of Northern India, not yet threatened by the British, would have united against the invading army. The French overestimated Tippoo Sahib's power. The British navy's superior strength would have cut off any army in Egypt from France, making the project risky. The fate of the campaign was sealed when the French fleet was destroyed in the Bay of Aboukir, and Acre's defense by Sir Sidney Smith was crucial. The failure of the enterprise can be attributed to Nelson, Sir Sidney Smith, and Sir Ralph Abercrombie.|"['1.

The sheik and his men discussed the French army's imminent attack on the city of Alexandria. The sheik expressed concerns about the French army's superior firepower and strategic position near Pompey's Pillar. He believed that the French, led by the skilled General Bonaparte, would swiftly capture the city. Despite considering a southern route into the city, the sheik decided to wait and observe the situation. Meanwhile, Arab scouts reported that the French had landed and were advancing towards the city in columns. The sheik's tribe engaged in skirmishes with the French forces but had to retreat due to heavy fire. The sheik then dispatched riders to warn Ramanieb of the French landing. The sheik and his men prepared to make a decision at sunrise about whether to enter the city or not.|"[""1.

The sheik and his Arab companions rode swiftly south, confident that the Franks wouldn't attack without cannon. As they waited patiently, Edgar, eager for action, paced restlessly. Suddenly, the sound of cannon and musketry erupted in the distance, signaling battle. The young Arab, filled with excitement, gripped his spear, eyes fixed on the city. The sheik's battle cry spurred them forward, galloping towards the distant city. After a brief stop to water their horses, they reached a vantage point overlooking Alexandria. The sheik observed the distant battle as the French engaged the town's defenses. The group discussed the ongoing conflict, speculating on the French assault. Despite the loss, the French eventually gained entry to the town, negotiating its surrender to avoid further destruction.

Messages were quickly sent out across the land, announcing that the French had arrived to end the Mameluke rule and were allies of the Sultan of Turkey. Villages that surrendered would be safeguarded, while those that resisted faced destruction. Seven hundred Turkish captives, freed during the capture of Malta, were generously sent home with money for their journey to Tripoli, Algiers, Morocco, Syria, Smyrna, and Constantinople. These actions had a positive impact. Koraim reached out to nearby Arab tribes, persuading their leaders to support the French by ensuring the road from Alexandria to Damanhour remained open and providing horses, camels, and dromedaries. As French troops unloaded in Alexandria, Koraim's messenger relayed Edgar's refusal to join forces, prompting a swift departure to avoid potential tribal conflicts.|"['1.

The sheik was hesitant about aiding the Franks against the Turks and Mamelukes. He believed that the Franks, if victorious, would not leave the land in peace but would become rulers themselves. Ben Ouafy, a wise man, advised caution. He warned that the promises of the Franks might be forgotten once their goals were achieved. The sheik, concerned about the safety of his tribe and their possessions, decided to meet the Franks to hear their intentions. Ben Ouafy highlighted the greed that drives men to make questionable choices, like aiding the Franks for profit. The sheik, realizing the strength of the Frankish army, chose not to fight against his own people but to maintain peace for the sake of his tribe. Edgar, aware of potential dangers, opted to disguise himself in Arab clothing to avoid drawing attention in Cairo.|"[""1.

A small group of travelers rode a short distance when they spotted a large group of Arab horsemen approaching. The leader of the travelers met with the Arab leaders and returned with news that Mourad Bey and his forces were nearby. Orders had been sent to all Arab tribes to gather and oppose the enemy. The travelers decided to return to gather their fighting men, leaving the caravan to proceed without guard. They caught up with the caravan quickly and ordered them to turn back. The French army, marching through a barren land, faced hardships due to thirst and exhaustion. General Muireur was killed by hidden Arabs, leading the French to maintain strict ranks. Despite occasional Arab attacks, the French reached Ramanieh, finding relief in the sight of the Nile's green banks.|"['1.

Ignoring orders, the soldiers left their positions and hurried towards a stream, where many plunged in, still dressed in their uniforms. They discovered an abundance of melons in the fields, a welcome change from the biscuits they had been surviving on since leaving Alexandria. However, some fell ill from overeating, and a few even died. The army rested the next day, with the horses needing the break more than the men. The Mamelukes, a formidable force, appeared, but after a brief artillery exchange, they retreated. The Bedouins, under their sheik, observed the French army from afar, waiting for an opportunity to engage. The French encountered Egyptian gunboats near a village, and the Mamelukes charged fiercely but were repelled by French artillery. Despite their grand appearance, the Mamelukes were no match for the French firepower, suffering heavy casualties and leaving behind abandoned guns.|['1.

Edgar was surprised by the resilience of the Franks against the cannon charge. He marveled at the exploding shells and sought an explanation from Edgar. Edgar described how shells work, with a fuse lighting up to explode upon impact. The battle on the river was fierce, with gun-boats captured and recaptured. Admiral Perrè was wounded, and losses were heavy on both sides. The French faced hardships and mutiny during their march in Egypt. They doubted Cairo's existence, with some even drowning in despair. Harassed by Arabs, the French army marched at night, halting by day. As they approached the enemy camp, Napoleon strategized to attack the immovable cannons. The Mamelukes charged, but the French repelled them with musketry and grape-shot. The battle was intense, with both sides showing courage and determination.|['1.

The battle was fierce as Mourad Bey led 2000 men towards Gizeh, while the French pressed forward swiftly. Mourad attempted to break through the French lines with his Mamelukes, but the defeat was imminent. The French captured 1000 prisoners and valuable camels and horses. The Egyptian side suffered a loss of around 10,000 men. The French soldiers recovered drowned Mamelukes' bodies, finding gold and jewels. The Arabs, held in reserve, witnessed the chaos and decided to join the Mamelukes. The French, lacking cavalry, advanced with artillery, forcing the infantry to flee. The Arabs, realizing defeat, fled to the desert. The sheik acknowledged their defeat against the well-trained French infantry and artillery, foreseeing Napoleon's dominance in Cairo with both cavalry and infantry.|"['1.

For a limited time only, our fleet will return soon, leaving the enemy troops stranded. They may linger for a while, but ultimately they will have to depart. It is likely that we will dispatch an army to confront them. We will assess their strength and realize they cannot receive reinforcements. In the end, although they have taken control of Egypt, they are essentially captives themselves. When asked for advice, the sheik deferred to a knowledgeable individual, acknowledging his own lack of understanding of the Franks' ways. The advice given was to return promptly to the oasis. The French forces will likely concentrate near Cairo, scouting the area with cavalry and light artillery. The sheik decided to split his followers, with some returning immediately and others departing at daybreak to retrieve women and supplies. The road should be secure from the French for a while, but the Arab territories may pose a threat due to the general unrest.|"[""1.

Initially, the French response was weak, caught off guard by Nelson's tactics. It took time for the French to prepare their guns, but once ready, their fire matched the British. The battle was intense, with losses on both sides. The French rear-admiral's inaction nearly turned the tide, but the British ships prevailed with help from the _Alexandria_ and _Swiftsure_.

The battle at Aboukir Bay was a decisive victory for the British, with most of the French fleet either surrendered, blown up, or captured. The French army was now cut off, and the Sultan of Constantinople declared war against France. The news brought hope to the people of Egypt, showing that the French were not invincible. Sidi's father decided to rejoin the desert tribesmen, leaving his wife and animals behind. Sidi was advised by his father to go to Cairo with his friend, Edgar, to gather information about the French.

In under an hour, they rode swiftly across the plain. Covering a distance of 110 miles in two days, the group camped outside the town on a barren patch of land. Surrounding them were shabby huts belonging to the poorest locals and makeshift tents of black fabric set up by wandering Arabs. Disguised as commoners, they blended in with the crowd to observe the French activities and the town's atmosphere. Edgar warned his companions to act inconspicuously, like spies on a mission. As they ventured into Cairo, the bustling streets showcased a variety of trades and goods, with French soldiers mingling among the merchants. Despite the lively scene, whispers of unrest and danger loomed, hinting at potential trouble stirring in the city's shadows.|['1.

Two officers discussed the challenges of their military campaign in a foreign land. They debated the feasibility of marching to India or Constantinople. The difficulties of the terrain and the lack of provisions made the prospect daunting. They concluded that Constantinople might be a more viable destination. As they walked through the town, they sensed growing unrest among the locals. The prospect of a French army withdrawal and potential uprisings loomed. Edgar, disguised and unrecognizable, intervened when his friend Sidi was attacked by two men. In a swift and skilled move, Edgar defended Sidi by incapacitating one attacker and thwarting the other.

Two friends rushed into a house, closed the door, and quickly ran out to the empty yard behind it. They scaled a wall into another yard, entered an open door, and silently moved through a passage. Wiping blood from their arms, they checked for stains before walking out into a lane. They talked about a boxing trick used to defend themselves. The next day, a grand review of troops marked the republic's anniversary. News of a battle between French and Mamelukes arrived. The French fortifications and actions in Cairo stirred unrest among the people. High taxes and desecration of sacred places fueled anger. The friends decided to leave the area and monitor the situation, hoping to avoid any conflict.|"['1.

"The next morning, they set off at daybreak, rode down to Boulak, and were ferried across the river with their horses. They then rode to the Pyramids. Shortly after, a cloud of dust appeared in the southwest, and the sheik arrived with fifty followers. ""What news do you bring?"" he asked his son. The sheik had heard that the people of Cairo were planning to revolt against the French. Despite the absence of some French troops, the sheik's son, Edgar, doubted the success of the uprising. He believed that the French's military discipline and firepower would ultimately prevail. The sheik, however, felt compelled to join the fight against the French, understanding the risks involved.

The sheik acknowledged the advantage of infantry over cavalry in urban warfare and decided to send their horses back to the desert. Edgar proposed this idea to the sheik, emphasizing the risk of using horses in narrow Cairo streets. The sheik agreed, realizing the importance of preserving his horse Zeila, whom he cherished dearly. The saddle was transferred to one of the sheik's followers as they prepared to head to Cairo. Once there, they gathered with other Arabs, learning of the ongoing conflict in the city. Napoleon and his troops were engaged in combat with insurgents. The sheik and his men entered the city cautiously, staying informed of the situation. Napoleon strategically positioned his troops in El-Esbekieh Square, fortifying the area with cannons and keeping the troops on high alert overnight.

The town was in turmoil. French restaurants were ransacked, and the insurgents gathered near the cemetery. The sheik urged immediate action, fearing the French were preparing. Inside the Mosque of Gama El Ashar, leaders debated attacking. The sheik emphasized the need for a swift assault to catch the French off guard. However, impatience had already hindered their plans. Despite the odds, the sheik remained determined to fight. He believed that even in defeat, the uprising would inspire resistance.

Edgar, a foreigner who had joined the Arab cause, expressed his disgust at the murder of innocent shopkeepers by the insurgents. He believed that attacking unarmed civilians was dishonorable and brought shame to their cause. He argued that the French soldiers were not responsible for the actions of their government and that peaceful people should not be harmed in war. Despite his country being at war with the French, he found it more justifiable to fight alongside the French soldiers than the bloodthirsty insurgents. As the battle loomed, Edgar felt uneasy about the impending violence. When the French made their move, chaos erupted as the insurgents lacked a unified plan. The sheik proposed a strategy to ambush the French soldiers as they entered the town square.

As a large French group entered the street, a fierce battle erupted. Shots rained down from rooftops and windows, while men armed with swords attacked the column. Despite many French casualties, the soldiers fought back with bayonets, pushing back the assailants. The French, enraged by the attack and the loss of their comrades, sought revenge. Led by an Arab sheik, a hundred men charged forward, only to be met with a deadly cannon blast. The sheik's group was decimated, and the French soldiers advanced with more cannons. In the chaos, Edgar and his friends narrowly avoided the gunfire. As the battle unfolded, Edgar found refuge in a looted shop, disguising himself in European clothes.

After the French column passed, Edgar tended to his wound, changed his clothes, and ventured out to follow the troops towards the Mosque of Gama El Ashar. As the French forces faced little resistance, they halted near the mosque to wait for other columns. General Gonmartin positioned artillery near Fort Dupres, bombarding the town. Edgar joined civilians seeking safety with the French troops. A fierce battle erupted as insurgents tried to take a battery defended by the French. The insurgents were mostly defeated, with many fleeing back to the town gate. French infantry and cavalry charged, resulting in the capture of 400 insurgents. Subsequently, the French attacked the crowded Mosque of Gama El Ashar, leading to a brutal slaughter of around 6000 Moslems. The French army, content with the vengeance, returned to the square, ensuring peace through a proclamation issued by town leaders.

"After finishing their meal, the Arabs entrusted the horses to a neighbor they had met. They took down the rough tent and wrapped themselves in dark blankets to hide their white clothes. ""Leave the pistols but take your knives,"" Edgar advised. As they headed towards Fort Dupres, the moon had not yet risen, and they encountered no one. The city was silent, fearful of French retaliation. They found bodies of men from the city and French cavalry, examining each carefully. Eventually, they discovered the wounded sheik among the fallen. Edgar tended to his wounds and fashioned a stretcher with spears and blankets to carry him.

Edgar expressed hope that the wounded man wasn't fatally injured. He suggested using spears to carry him, planning to leave him five miles away from town to avoid French soldiers. Edgar left money for food and water, instructing the others to stay with the wounded man. He intended to return to the city to find Sidi among the prisoners. After cleaning his hands of blood stains, he headed back to the city, feeling weak from blood loss. Edgar rested briefly before going to a hut to hire a donkey for transportation. He learned that the prisoners were to be tried by court-martial, and many were expected to be executed. Edgar then rode to the citadel, where he awaited the trial's start, fearing for the Arab prisoners' fate.|"['1.

"During the two hours he sat there, Edgar decided on the story he would tell. As the hour neared, French officers rode into the citadel. People entering on foot were questioned by the sentry. Just before ten, Edgar approached the officer, ""I have evidence about a prisoner who saved my life from rioters. He is a lad like me."" The officer agreed to hear him out and sent a soldier to take Edgar to the court-martial. In the quadrangle, prisoners were guarded by soldiers. One officer, Giovanni Baptista, mentioned how an Arab boy saved his life. Edgar shared his story of how the same Arab boy had saved him too. The officer advised Edgar to seek employment at the intendence using General Rombaud's name. Among the Arab prisoners, Edgar spotted Sidi but refrained from making contact.

Five minutes later, a sergeant emerged and selected four men from a nearby company to escort six prisoners. After a brief period, three of the men were led away by a soldier towards the gate, while the remaining three were confined behind a nearby door with sentries posted outside. Edgar suspected that those three were condemned to death. The process continued for over an hour, with groups of prisoners being processed every few minutes. When the Arabs were brought in, all six were taken to the ominous door. Among them was Sidi, who Edgar identified to the soldier. They were allowed into a room where six French officers sat at a table. General Rombaud acknowledged Edgar's testimony and decided to spare Sidi due to his past actions. Grateful and emotional, Sidi expressed relief at seeing Edgar alive and shared the sorrow of losing his father in the conflict. Together, they left the room, with tears of relief streaming down Sidi's face.|"['1.

Edgar brought good news to Sidi, saying he found his father alive among the dead, injured but not fatally. He assured Sidi that his father was being cared for in a grove six miles away, where he was expected to recover. Concerned for Sidi's well-being, Edgar urged him to rest and offered to fetch new clothes, food, and medicine. After providing Sidi with a change of clothes and some nourishment, Edgar arranged for donkeys to transport them to Sidi's father. Sidi, feeling better after eating, prepared to leave to reunite with his recovering father.|"['1.

Sidi and Edgar walked towards the donkeys, Sidi stepping out more firmly than before. Concealed in his burnoose, Sidi expressed gratitude to Edgar for saving their lives. Sidi narrated his adventures, from his horse falling to the court-martial room. As they neared the village, Sidi paid for the animals and surprised the boy with a tip. They approached the Arabs, who welcomed Sidi joyfully. The Arabs informed Sidi that his father was weak but better. Sidi's father believed Sidi was dead, causing him grief. The sheik expressed sorrow over his son's fate but was relieved to hear he was a prisoner in the citadel. The sheik feared for his son's life, knowing the consequences of being caught in battle against the Franks.|"['1.

Edgar calmly delivered the good news to the sheik that Sidi had been released. He advised the sheik to remain calm and quiet as his father was weak but aware of his presence. Edgar then instructed the men to prepare a meal for the sheik using a small cooking pot and dry sticks to avoid smoke. The men assured Edgar that they had secured provisions from a nearby village and that they had found a safe haven in the grove. Edgar planned to move the sheik and Sidi to the mountains for safety, away from potential French searches for wounded fugitives.

"""Sidi, can you help lift your father a little? I want him to have some broth to keep up his strength,"" said Edgar. The sheik and his son had been reunited, and the sheik fell asleep after drinking the broth. Edgar suggested moving him to a safer place, fearing the French might search for the wounded. He advised Sidi to change into peasant clothes to avoid suspicion. They planned to hide in the hills in an old tomb until the sheik was well enough to travel. After the sheik woke up refreshed, Edgar arranged for the wounds to be properly bandaged by Hassan and Ali, who were experienced in treating injuries from their raids. Edgar dressed in peasant attire and bought similar outfits for the others. With the wounds dressed and a plan in place, Edgar shared his strategy with the sheik."|"['1.

Apart from the deep cut on his face, the sheik had another on his left arm. A third cut grazed his right side, and a musket shot left a deep groove on his hip. Edgar had bought kabobs in the village, and at night, the two Arabs, now disguised, filled water-skins at the well. The sheik drank the broth, then laid on a blanket attached to spears. Blankets were placed under his head, and soon he fell asleep. Some more kabobs stewed as they set off. Sidi and Edgar carried the sheik, with the weight evenly distributed. They headed for the hills, away from the village. They found a spot to rest, ensuring the sheik was comfortable. Sidi checked on his father, who was sleeping soundly. The fire warmed broth for him.

Edgar assured his companions that there was no rush. He planned to search for a tomb where they could find shelter from the scorching sun and night dew. Feeling safe from French interference, he believed the soldiers would be preoccupied with other matters. Edgar predicted Kleber would head to Damietta, while Desaix was far south. He suspected a force might march to Suez. Edgar recounted his recent encounter with the French, where he lost his horse and sustained a minor arm injury. After breakfast, he scouted a shady spot for the sheik to rest. Discovering a suitable location with rock ledges, he created a makeshift shelter using a blanket. Edgar, accompanied by Hassan, explored the nearby tombs, observing the ancient designs and artwork. Satisfied with their findings, they returned to the sheik's resting place.|"['1.

The sheik remained silent, gazing at Edgar with a puzzled look. About to inquire about the sheik's health, Sidi spoke up, expressing gratitude for Edgar's help in saving their lives. Overwhelmed with emotion, the sheik struggled to find the words to convey his thanks. Edgar humbly downplayed his actions, emphasizing the bond they shared. The sheik acknowledged the bravery Edgar displayed, contrasting it with his and Sidi's initial reaction to Edgar's disappearance. He praised Edgar's quick thinking and selfless actions in rescuing them from danger. Despite the risks involved, Edgar's unwavering dedication to their safety impressed the sheik. As the day waned, they moved the sheik to a cave for the night. Edgar and Sidi gathered supplies while the sheik rested, and a warm fire illuminated their makeshift shelter, providing comfort after a long day.|"['1.

Edgar spoke to the sheik after adding more sticks to the fire, discussing their upcoming plans. The sheik expressed gratitude for Edgar's advice that saved his wife's life. Edgar suggested sending a messenger with good news to the sheik's wife, who might think he and Sidi were dead. The sheik agreed to send a man with the news immediately. They also talked about the French possibly attacking the Arabs and how the French cavalry may target their oases. The sheik mentioned the advantage of their horses over the French ones due to the weight difference. They decided that Hassan would leave the next day to inform the sheik's wife and bring back a horse for water and provisions. They planned for Hassan to blend in by wearing peasant clothes and carrying extra water skins from nearby villages.|"[""1.

Edgar instructed Hassan to tend to the fire carefully, ensuring it stayed low. Ali had shared a secret with Hassan about possibly returning with the sheik's wife. When Ali and Ayala arrived, Edgar was pleased. Ali updated Edgar on the sheik's recovery. They decided to move inside, and Ayala took charge of caring for the sheik. Edgar visited nearby villages and learned of tensions between the Sultan and the French. He discussed the news with the sheik, predicting the Sultan's decision to declare war. Edgar believed the French's defeat at sea prompted this action. Now, with no reinforcements, the Sultan's army could potentially overpower the French in Egypt.|"['1.

Edgar was informed that French cavalry had ventured into the desert, pushing back the Arabs who had gathered near the Nile. Despite this, the French were unable to gain an advantage as the Arabs retreated each time the cavalry approached. The Arabs only suffered minor losses, using the desert's terrain to their advantage. The sheik, having recovered, felt ready for the journey. Disguised as peasants, the group set off early in the morning towards the Pyramids. The sheik, in traditional Arab attire, led the way on horseback. Edgar and Sidi scouted a path through the hills. Carefully descending, they reached the river at dawn. The ferryman, though surprised by the group's composition, helped them cross the river. Once on the other side, they continued their journey at a steady pace towards their destination.|"['1.

As the sun rose, Sidi and his companions approached the Pyramid. A group of thirty horsemen swiftly rode out to meet them, waving their weapons in excitement and shouting greetings. Sidi and the Arabs had changed into traditional attire upon landing, though they found it distasteful. The Beni Ouafy tribe warmly welcomed their chief, expressing relief at his safe return. The sheik, moved by the reception, led the group towards the Pyramids. He acknowledged the sacrifices made during their recent battles, praising Edgar, who had saved their lives. The sheik outlined a plan to return home cautiously, avoiding encounters with French troops. He instructed some members to secure the women and children, warning of potential dangers ahead.

Zeila was thrilled to meet the sheik and his horse, but there was no time for long greetings. The sheik mounted his horse, with Ayala riding behind him. Ali and Hassan, along with two other men, joined the group as they headed north. Sidi and Edgar rode their own horses towards the southwest. The French cavalry, about fifteen hundred strong, were within a mile, but they didn't bother the smaller group. The party continued on, keeping an eye on the French from a distance. Sidi decided to send two of his best men with Edgar to keep an eye on the French while they rode ahead. Edgar and his men waited until the French were close, then moved on. They eventually reached the wells, refilled their water supplies, and set off towards the oasis of the Beni Ouafy. The Arabs were confident in their ability to navigate the desert, relying on their horses' instincts to find water even in the darkest night.|"[""1.

At ten in the evening, Edgar arrived at the Bedouins' camp after traveling over eighty miles from the Pyramid. Sidi's group had reached the camp half an hour earlier, and Edgar found Sidi with his uncle, who was older than his father. The sheik welcomed Edgar, grateful for his help to Sidi and his family. Edgar shared that Sidi's family was headed to the wells of Orab, camping there for the night, and would take about three days to reach the camp. The sheik, knowing they couldn't fight the approaching Franks, planned to move the women, children, and supplies to the wells of Azim, seventy miles away, with a guard of a hundred men. Meanwhile, he intended to harass the Franks if they caused trouble and hoped for peace through a message delivered by two horsemen with a white flag.

A celebration with the sheep, goats, and extra horses began at dawn. The rest of the group spread out beside the long line of camels. Sidi's group set off at the same time. The sheik had been busy organizing the camp's move and asked Sidi and Edgar to stay back to hear about the Cairo events. After sharing the story, they had a meal, said goodbye, and rode off. They caught up with the slow-moving group in an hour. After six days, they reached their previous campsite. Napoleon learned that the Sultan declared war when an army from Syria set up a fort in the desert between Syria and Egypt.

Mr. Muller was pleased to hear the news. Edgar's father had planned to make Mr. Muller his partner and have Edgar stay with him while he moved to London due to the French invasion. Edgar, prepared with European clothes, was to pose as a French trader's son from Cairo. The sheik and his son supported Edgar's decision to travel to England. They rode with him to Alexandria, where Edgar boarded an Italian brig as the sole passenger. The ship set sail, and after five days, they were still far from the Italian coast. On the sixth day, a British warship approached. Edgar's fluency in Italian impressed the captain. The warship stopped them, and the British captain offered Edgar a midshipman's rating to join him to Constantinople. Edgar had five minutes to decide.|"[""1.

Edgar quickly made up his mind. The idea of working in a London office didn't appeal to him at all. Instead, the thought of being on a ship, visiting places like Constantinople, and the chance of facing the French in battle excited him. In no time, he accepted the captain's offer to be an interpreter on the British ship. As the _Tigre_ set sail, Edgar met an officer who recognized his father's work in Alexandria. Edgar shared his plans of returning to his father's business after the French left Egypt. Despite facing a bully named Condor onboard, Edgar was confident in his ability to handle any confrontation. His decision to join the ship for a few years of active service was driven by the opportunity to use his language skills and the thrill of adventure.|"[""1.

"Condor belonged to the latter class. As he lay in bed he saw clearly that he had made a great mistake, that his successes had been won simply because those he licked were less skilled or strong than himself, and that, in point of fact, instead of being, as he believed, a good boxer, he knew next to nothing about it. Edgar had, after the first day, gone in regularly to have a chat with him. He had been somewhat doubtful as to how his advances would be received, but had determined to do his best to become friends with Condor, whom he felt, rather remorsefully, he had punished terribly severely. ""I hope, Condor,"" he said the first time he entered, ""that you will believe that I have come in because I am really sorry that you have been hurt so much, and not from any idea of triumphing over you.

During the journey to the Dardanelles, the _Tigre_ faced changing weather, requiring frequent adjustments to the sails. Edgar, while on watch, learned from his friend Wilkinson, observing his commands and actions closely. Soon, Edgar was proficient enough to assist in reefing the sails during sudden squalls.

Condor, absent until then, reappeared at mealtime, looking better but with slight discoloration under his eyes. After an initial awkwardness, the atmosphere lightened as the midshipmen welcomed Condor back. The meal ended, a boat was lowered, and Edgar was excused by Condor for a few hours.

The Porte, also known as the Ottoman government, had limited resources to assist in naval operations. They could only provide two bomb ships and seventeen gun-boats. However, there was a delay in placing these vessels under the command of Sir Sidney Smith. Ahmed Pasha, also called Djezzar Pasha, the Governor of Syria, was in Constantinople during this time. He rushed there to seek aid as he knew Napoleon was advancing towards Syria. Bonaparte swiftly responded by leading 12,428 men to conquer Syria. Despite facing challenges like thirst and harsh weather, the French defeated the Turkish and Mameluke cavalry, capturing El-A'rich. They then marched into Palestine, thinking their hardships were over. However, at Jaffa, the French faced resistance, and after breaching the town, a brutal massacre took place. Napoleon's decision to execute thousands of prisoners was widely condemned. Subsequently, diseases like the plague spread among the French troops, leading to further hardships.|"['1.

Napoleon faced a challenging situation. Despite his care for the wounded and efforts to uplift their spirits, the army's health was at risk in Jaffa. He couldn't risk spreading illness or leaving the dying behind. After much deliberation, a plan was set in motion. Sir Sidney Smith took charge in Syria, a critical move due to the lack of trust in local leaders. The _Tigre_ was to sail to Alexandria, part of a strategic agreement. The crew, eager for action after a long stay in Constantinople, welcomed the order. Edgar, valued for his interpreting skills, relished his shore duties. When news of Jaffa's fall arrived, urgency gripped the crew. Sir Sidney swiftly set sail for Acre, anticipating a French assault.

On her way, she picked up the _Theseus_, which was cruising, and the two men-of-war arrived off Acre on March 15th. Napoleon had not appeared before the town yet. Sir Sidney Smith took command of the operations due to the convention terms. The arrival of the men-of-war excited the garrison and inhabitants, who now believed in beating off the French. The French were seen marching along Mount Carmel and the sea, but the men-of-war boats opened fire, forcing them to change course. Sir Sidney Smith believed the French lacked a siege train. The _Theseus_ was sent to Jaffa to prevent the landing of guns or stores. A corvette and gun-boats were seen, and the _Tigre_ pursued and captured seven gun-boats. The captured guns and ammunition were transported to the Turkish troops for the defence of Acre. Edgar assisted in translating orders to the Turkish soldiers during the operation.|['1.

Lambert, the French leader, had a howitzer, a small gun, and eighty troops. He ordered them not to fire until he commanded. As the gun-boats approached to set fire to French storehouses, they faced a sudden heavy attack. The French guns loaded with grape shot and musketry caused significant damage. The gun-boat leading the attack was hit the hardest, losing most of its crew. The vessel surrendered after being grounded. The capture was valuable for the French, especially the 32-pounder cannon on board. The French quickly transported the captured gun-boat to their batteries, improving their siege capabilities. Lieutenant Beatty noted the risky move of the gun-boats and anticipated tough battles ahead due to weak defenses. The French were fortifying their positions, and the town of Acre's strategic location made it defensible against naval attacks.|"['1.

The water was too shallow for the warships to anchor close to shore. The _Tigre_ was moored over a mile away, alongside the _Alliance_ sloop. French and Turkish gun-boats were positioned closer to shore, ready to defend against the impending French attack. Sir Sidney Smith, along with his aides-de-camp, was stationed on land, prepared for any emergency. The midshipmen's mess adhered to set meal times, while Sir Sidney took meals whenever possible. The midshipmen rotated ashore daily to relay messages swiftly. Turkish guns and British sailors returned fire, but the French battery caused significant damage to the tower. Edgar, along with his companions, observed the French fire and noted a breach in the tower, signaling an imminent French assault. They rushed to alert the Turks and gather reinforcements to defend against the impending attack.|['1.

"Edgar realized he had shared the news too abruptly. He sprinted along the wall until he reached the stairs leading down to the open space in front of Djezzar's palace. Familiar with the layout, he headed straight to the chambers where Djezzar conducted business. ""The French have breached the tower, pasha,"" he urgently informed. ""Their storming party was on the verge of crossing the ditch when I left. There are no defenders at the breach, and those on the wall are fleeing. Unless you rally the men, the town is lost."" Edgar hurried back towards the breach and encountered his companions with the marines and blue-jackets close behind. The French, however, faced unexpected challenges at the breach, where a counterscarp and moat impeded their progress, allowing the defenders to repel their assault.

During the siege, the defenders learned that the French were digging a mine. Colonel Phelypeaux had been working tirelessly to prepare for this. They filled the breach with combustible materials and set up shells with fuses to drop on the attackers. The British soldiers worked quickly, boosting the morale of the Turkish troops. A consultation among Sir Sidney Smith, Captain Wilmot, Colonel Phelypeaux, and the pasha led to a plan. They decided to make a strong attack to disrupt the French mining operation. Three columns were formed for the assault. As they moved out in the early morning, the Turks were loud, alerting the French. Sir Sidney ordered a fierce response with cannons and guns from the ships. The Turks bravely engaged the French in hand-to-hand combat, while a group tried to sabotage the mine. Despite facing heavy resistance, they managed to cause some disruption before being forced to retreat.|['1.

Lieutenant Knight, exhausted from blood loss and aiding the pioneers, needed help leaving the gallery and was carried away by seamen. Major Oldfield, leading the marines of _Theseus_, died along with two of his men. Mr. Janverin, a midshipman of the _Tigre_, and eleven others were wounded. Beatty and Forbes, midshipmen of the _Theseus_, sustained minor injuries, as did five marines from that ship, a seaman, and two marines from the _Alliance_. The Turkish troops on the wall opened fire as the group retreated, and the batteries intensified their attack. The bugles signaled the retreat of the Turkish forces, which proceeded without incident. The Turks were in good spirits, displaying sixty decapitated heads of the enemy. Despite the sortie's failure, the Turks fought bravely and impressed the French, who now took greater precautions.|"['1.

Sir Sidney Smith commended the Turks for their admirable behavior and acknowledged their bravery once they overcame their initial doubts about the French. The French, under Napoleon's leadership, had been well supplied by the locals in Palestine, particularly Christians who were promised liberation from Turkish rule. Sir Sidney countered Napoleon's proclamations by distributing his own messages, clarifying the situation and warning the Syrians about the true intentions of the French. The English support for the Syrian Christians influenced the supply dynamics to the French camp. The French attempted multiple assaults on the breach, facing heavy resistance and suffering significant losses due to the effective defense tactics employed by the Turks and British forces. The ongoing conflict intensified as both sides engaged in frequent skirmishes and counterattacks, resulting in casualties on both sides.|"[""1.

The battle was fierce as swords clashed and pikes clashed against bayonets. An ally, Djezzar, joined the fight, rallying soldiers to defend the breach. The reinforcements brought hope, allowing a strategic sally against the enemy. The Turks rushed out, but the new regiment faltered under fire, retreating back to safety. Despite this setback, the French were forced to retreat from the breach due to the strong defense. Napoleon observed the chaos from afar, signaling a new plan. The defenders lured the French into the town, ambushing them with a surprise attack. As the French advanced, they were met with a sudden onslaught from all sides. The Albanians in the garden fought fiercely, causing heavy casualties among the French. The Turkish troops emerged victorious, dealing a significant blow to the enemy forces.|"[""1.

The loud sounds of battle echoed through the town as the French forces fought bravely but were eventually pushed back by the defenders. Bonaparte himself led the assault, standing firm at the top of the tower. Despite Kleber's valiant efforts, the Turks proved to be a formidable enemy. The casualties were high on both sides, with many lives lost in the fierce conflict. The French troops faced dwindling numbers and supplies, making their situation increasingly dire. Following a failed sortie by the Turkish regiment, a second attempt saw them briefly break through enemy lines before being forced to retreat. The French frigates off Caesarea prompted Sir Sidney to set sail in pursuit, but a tragic accident aboard the _Theseus_ claimed many lives, including Captain Miller's. Despite the setbacks, the French frigates were eventually driven away, marking a bittersweet victory for the British forces.|"['1.

Captain Miller's loss was a heavy blow to Sir Sidney Smith, who appointed Lieutenant Canes to command the _Theseus_ and transferred Lieutenant England to first lieutenant of the _Tigre_. The French siege ended after suffering significant losses, leading to the raising of the siege and the French army's departure. Sir Sidney Smith's offer of safe passage to France for the French army added to their discontent. The _Tigre_ intercepted the French army's retreat, providing aid to the sick and wounded.

The pasha expressed his gratitude to Sir Sidney Smith and his sailors for saving the town from the French attack. He admitted that without their help, the town would have fallen easily. The pasha also praised the bravery of the sailors during the siege, especially towards the end when they fought fiercely against the French. Sir Sidney Smith mentioned the possibility of encountering French frigates again but assured the pasha that the French would not return to the town due to the news of their defeat spreading fear among the Egyptians. The pasha then commended the young midshipmen for their valuable service during the siege and offered them gifts as tokens of appreciation. Edgar and Wilkinson received precious jewels as gifts, recognizing their courage and dedication during the siege. Sir Sidney Smith declined an offer from the pasha for Blagrove to join his service permanently, citing concerns about the pasha's leadership and potential dangers.|"['1.

""Djezzar has behaved very handsomely,"" Sir Sidney said. ""He obtained from me a list of all the officers of the three ships and of the petty officers who have specially distinguished themselves. He has given me jewels to hand to all the officers in his name, and also purses of money for the petty officers. He is, you know, immensely rich. The old fellow was really grieved that he could not offer anything to me; he said as much, but I at once pointed out that, putting everything else aside, it would be an unheard-of thing for the commander-in-chief of the Sultan's army to receive a present from one, however high in rank, who was under his orders. He just now insisted, however, that we should exchange rings, and as he had absolutely tears in his eyes when he spoke, I could not refuse, though mine was but a signet-ring with my crest, and his a diamond worth, I should say, a thousand pounds if it is worth a penny.""

"""No, I will take a watch, at any rate until we see how the petty officers get on.

I don't think, in a breeze like this, that the _Tigre_ would be able to catch us, although, of course, if the wind strengthened much her weight would tell. However, there is no doubt at all that this craft is fast. I hope ere long we shall try our speed against one of these pirates. I expect that off the wind with those big lateen sails of theirs they are very fast, but on the wind they would have no chance with us.

The governor offered to find two experienced men to help Edgar in his mission against the pirates. These men were former ship captains who now owned multiple vessels. Edgar learned from them about the pirates' possible hideouts and tactics. The two men were asked to gather more information from the town and meet Edgar at the landing-place after dark. The crew prepared the ship with ammunition and provisions. The next morning, they set sail southward and then changed course northward between islands where piracy was common. The crew disguised the ship as a merchant vessel to avoid suspicion. They were advised to steer east of Astropalaia, a known pirate stronghold. As they approached the Pirate Rocks, the wind died down, leaving them becalmed near the island, where potential pirate ships might be lurking.

Some boats are used for fishing when the seas are calm and there are warships nearby, while larger ones may engage in trading. Smaller boats may carry a couple of guns, while larger ones may have eight or ten, but these are usually smaller than yours. They sometimes use cannons taken from captured ships but generally avoid relying on their guns. They prefer stealth, attacking at night or appearing peaceful during the day to surprise their targets. At Rhodes, they disguised their ship by wetting the sails with muddy water and altering the appearance of the rigging. The crew prepared for potential conflict by sharpening weapons and loading guns. The sailors eagerly participated in the disguise, viewing it as a break from their usual duties.

On the ship, the crew hoped for calm seas to avoid drawing attention from pirates. To deceive potential threats, they sang songs and maintained silence in between. When a fishing boat approached, they realized it was not a threat and continued their ruse. Strategizing, they planned to surprise the pirates by pretending to be an easy target. Dividing the crew, they prepared to capture the pirates using the element of surprise.

The ships varied in size, with some as small as thirty tons and others up to a hundred and fifty, armed with light guns. The _Tigress_ approached the line, pretending to be Turkish ships. When the crew realized the ruse, they fired their guns. The crew of the _Tigress_ retaliated by targeting the pirate ships. The pirates, overwhelmed by the heavy fire, abandoned their ships and fled to the shore. The _Tigress_ then bombarded the pirates on land. A landing party was sent ashore, encountering resistance from the pirates hiding in houses. After a fierce firefight, the pirates fled, leaving behind valuable loot from their raids on various ships.

After exploring the underground storage, Wilkinson and his crew made a surprising discovery near the houses - what seemed to be a well filled with saltwater. Intrigued, Wilkinson descended into the ancient well and found a hidden chamber packed with goods. Edgar speculated that the place might have been part of an old castle, possibly used for storage or as a prison. The pirates likely stumbled upon it while clearing the well. The crew emptied the hidden storehouses and burned down the pirate's hideouts on the island. The villagers, though not involved in piracy, were likely aiding the pirates in secret. Wilkinson advised them to take action against pirates to prove their innocence.

The _Tigress_ sailed with a heavy load of spoils, causing her to sit lower in the water. The prisoners posed a dilemma; the crew debated their fate and decided to give them a boat and lashings instead of execution. The pirates' retreat led to successful trade in Smyrna, where the prizes were sold. The ship continued its voyage, encountering occasional resistance but mostly scaring off pirates.

"He yelled to the deck, but it took a while for his voice to rise above the storm's noise. When someone finally looked up, he gestured to the back. The sailor rushed to the helm and alerted Wilkinson about Edgar. Edgar then motioned towards the rocks. Wilkinson signaled back, and Edgar, leaving the sailor on watch, descended to the deck. ""I was thinking the same, Blagrove, not much difference. I'm not concerned now that we're clear of the rocks. Once we pass them, we can steer off the wind again, and there's nothing in our path for over forty miles, just a small island with deep water all around. I've just reviewed the chart."" An hour later, the wind weakened, the fore-staysail was reefed, and by sunset, the ship was sailing again with fresh topsails being prepared. 

""You've done remarkably well,"" Wilkinson was praised in a letter. ""The pashas of Smyrna and Rhodes admire your work. Your report on capturing or destroying pirate vessels speaks for itself."" They welcomed the order. They had only made a few small captures in the past month and were content to return to regular duties after their independent ventures.

We fully understood that we were to share any captured items with the Tigre. It would have been unfair to gain an advantage over our comrades in prize money.

We didn't face major battles, just some skirmishes. Two men were shot during a pirate attack, and many crew members were wounded but all recovered. The casualties need to be listed in our report. It's essential to focus on successful operations rather than high casualties. You and Mr. Blagrove are invited to dine with me. If the weather changes, Mr. Blagrove should remain on board. Let's go below and catch up. We've had some excitement here but mostly dull times. The Turks and French had a skirmish, and we tried to assist the Turks. Bonaparte was near Ramanieh, and we hoped the Turks could hold their ground. Unfortunately, the Turkish gun-boats didn't arrive in time to help. The Turks defended bravely, but the French were provoked when the Turks cut off the fallen's heads. This enraged the French, leading to a fierce final attack.|"['1.

The chaos was intense as the Turks were ousted. The sandy strip was swarmed with refugees, many plunging into the water and swimming to us. The castle, a small place, was packed to the brim, and thousands were left outside. Our ship's artillery kept the French at bay temporarily, and when the Turkish gunboats finally positioned themselves, the French had to retreat and attack the castle conventionally. Mustapha Pasha had been captured, leaving the garrison leaderless. Despite this, they resisted for two days before surrendering due to severe thirst. The marines played a crucial role in saving the castle, with Colonel Douglas restoring order. The Turks were fighting amongst themselves until Colonel Douglas intervened. The entire situation arose because Mustapha Pasha did not heed Sir Sidney's advice to act against Damietta or Rosetta. Instead, the ships stationed themselves in the Bay of Aboukir, deterring the French from sending reinforcements to fight the Turks.|"['1.

"""I have been considering your situation, gentlemen,"" Sir Sidney addressed them upon entering his quarters. ""I possess the authority to designate a prize agent in England, which I have not yet done. Initially, I had no intention of capturing prizes during my diplomatic mission here. The prizes we acquired were sent to Gibraltar, although it is not the best place for selling vessels due to low prices. Ordinarily, Malta would have been ideal, but since it is under French control, Gibraltar remains the only option in the Mediterranean. I will write to a friend who heads the prize court, proposing that your father, Mr. Blagrove, handles the sale of the Eastern goods due to his experience in trading with the East. We have also captured a brig, similar in size to the _Tigress_, which I suggest your father purchases to transport the cargo back. I can arrange for officers to assess its value. Additionally, I can provide passage for invalided men and officers on the brig. The proceeds from the merchandise sale will be managed by the prize court, while the brig's ownership will be your father's private venture. What are your thoughts on this plan?"" The young midshipmen were delighted with the proposal and expressed their gratitude to Sir Sidney for his assistance. Subsequently, a panel of officers estimated the French brig's value at £850, and Edgar officially acquired it in his father's name, drawing a bill for payment within three months."|"[""1.

Since he had joined the _Tigre_, Edgar had been in touch with Mr. Blagrove, who praised his decision to gain ship knowledge at sea, beneficial for their business. Edgar's letters from Egypt, especially detailing his role in the Cairo uprising, worried his family. The new ship, _Suzanne_, was loaded systematically. Edgar recruited skilled sailors, and Condor took command of the _Tigress_. Edgar's capture yielded valuable goods, though the exact worth was unknown. The crew shared prize money, and additional sailors joined for the voyage home. After transferring cargo, invalids were taken aboard for the journey to England.

He passed his exam and got his captain certificate before this voyage. Without it, he couldn't have taken Edgar's offer. The trip was quick. They paused at Gibraltar for water for two days. They faced trouble with the prize-agent there as the ship's papers showed it was a prize. Sir Sidney Smith couldn't spare a prize crew, so they sold her in Gibraltar. The ship had munitions of war for the French army, so the capture was lawful. The officials fixed her value at £850 and authorized the sale. Afterward, they sailed west of the usual track and encountered no issues until the Channel. The _Suzanne_ kept her distance from French privateers and anchored off Ryde. The gig took Wilkinson, Edgar, and the captain to Portsmouth, where Wilkinson reported to the admiral with despatches. The captain took the brig to London while the friends went to the Admiralty. Wilkinson's work was praised, and he was advised to pass his exams for promotion. He was told to wait for the examiners.|['1.

The short delay ended swiftly. Within ten minutes, the messenger summoned him to a room where three naval captains awaited. The central figure paused from his paperwork, commending Mr. Wilkinson on his responses. The captain noted Sir Sidney Smith's endorsement of Wilkinson's command of the _Tigress_ for the challenging island mission as proof of his readiness for advancement. After a few more inquiries, Wilkinson was praised for his success. Subsequently, he visited the prize court, delivering Sir Sidney Smith's note and discussing the cargo. The captain acknowledged the goods' assessment in Alexandria by an experienced merchant and the strategic sale planning. Plans were made to meet with Mr. Blagrove for further arrangements and to express gratitude to Sir Sidney Smith.

In the early afternoon, Wilkinson arrived at the _Tigre_. Edgar had praised Wilkinson's kindness and the friendship between them to Mr. and Mrs. Blagrove. Mr. Blagrove was pleased with the details of the interview with the president of the prize court. He decided to rent a warehouse for a month or two to work in peace. The goods were examined, sorted, and stored safely. Edgar left for Devonshire, and Mr. Blagrove and Edgar began selling the goods. Only a third was sold, but they made over £40,000. Mr. Blagrove expected a good sum for the rest. The fleet blockaded the Egyptian coast. In November, news came of an expedition to reconquer Egypt. Sir Sidney Smith went to assess the situation. French ships evaded the blockade, strengthening the French army.

One of the most remarkable harbors known is the Bay of Marmorice, located near Rhodes on the mainland. It was stumbled upon accidentally while pursuing a suspect vessel, leading to the discovery of a vast sheltered harbor capable of accommodating a hundred warships. This harbor left a lasting impression on the narrator, who considered it the finest he had ever seen. When Edgar returned to the ship _Tigress_, he received news of the substantial profits from the captured goods, totaling £133,000. Sir Sidney Smith commended the successful business deal facilitated by Edgar's father. Sir Sidney then set sail for Rhodes to meet Lord Keith, impressed by the harbor's potential as a rendezvous point for the fleet.

While stationed at Marmorice Bay, the general held frequent meetings with his subordinate. During these gatherings, various high-ranking officers were also present, asking numerous questions about the terrain between Alexandria and Cairo, the availability of animals for transportation, the food supplies, the march distances, and the potential support from the locals. The subordinate provided detailed answers, emphasizing the reliance on river transport for provisions due to the scarcity of horses. The general discussed the strategic importance of capturing Damietta and Rosetta before advancing, highlighting the need for gun-boats to secure supply routes.

The boats' progress was closely observed by Sir Ralph Abercrombie's team from the deck of the _Mondovi_. Edgar doubted any boat could make it to shore amidst the chaos of shots and shells. Cheers erupted as soldiers landed and advanced up the hill, forcing the French to retreat. Full success was only felt when all regiments were safely ashore. Troops dug for water, and Edgar led a cavalry to locate a peasant's hut. The peasant helped locate a well. Troopers dug and found water. The army established itself between the sea and the Lake of Aboukir. They marched to confront the French, who had reinforcements and strong defenses. Despite heavy losses, the British couldn't capture the French position. The British set up a strong defensive line with batteries and ample supplies. They besieged the castle of Aboukir, which surrendered on the eighteenth.|"[""1.

"On the day after Aboukir Castle was captured, an Arab was spotted riding swiftly towards the British side. French cavalry chased him, and another group tried to intercept him. The general was observing the troops working on the batteries when he noticed the chase. ""That Arab rides well,"" he remarked as they watched. The Arab, waving his gun defiantly, outmaneuvered his pursuers, crossing a canal and approaching the battery. Edgar, a naval officer, recognized the Arab as his friend Sidi. Overjoyed, they embraced. Sidi brought news of the French forces' plans to attack the next day. The general was pleased with Sidi's arrival and requested to be informed.

Sidi shared a crucial message with Lieutenant Blagrove. Early that morning, some tribesmen set out with sheep to bring to the British camp but were ambushed by French cavalry from Damanhour. Many were killed, but two escaped and informed their camp. Sidi, who set out later, overtook them and learned that the French were planning an imminent attack. Disguised as a peasant, he gathered intel in Damanhour, confirming General Menou's presence and the impending assault. Sidi raced back to share the news. As evening fell, the troops fortified their defenses. At 3 a.m., the army readied for a potential attack. The French surprised the British, initiating a fierce battle.

The battle unfolded with the 28th Regiment facing heavy fire from the front while the flanking columns advanced. The 58th Regiment was surrounded, but the colonel swiftly maneuvered, attacking the French with bayonets. The 23rd Regiment and the 42nd Regiment joined the fight, cutting off the French troops. General Abercrombie, despite facing cavalry charges, showed bravery, even disarming a French officer. Sir Ralph Abercrombie was wounded but continued to lead until the French retreated. The British forces endured an intense struggle, with both sides resorting to throwing stones when ammunition ran out. Ultimately, the British forces repelled the French attacks, leading to a French retreat.

The British force, with less than 10,000 men, only had half actively involved in the battle, while the French, around 11,000 strong, nearly all participated. The Capitan Pasha and his 6000 men landed, and three days later, Sir Ralph Abercrombie's death was mourned, succeeded by General Hutchinson. Edgar had a leisurely time as the French remained strong after the failed attack. The Capitan Pasha, with an interpreter, spent the night before the battle conversing with Sidi. The French feared the British cutting the Canal of Alexandria. General Hutchinson eventually ordered the canal to be cut, flooding the area. The British forces seized Fort St. Julian with the help of Sir Sidney Smith, who was later recalled due to a disagreement over a treaty with the French.|['1.

The Turks were still upset with Sir Sidney Smith for a previous incident, but he had not expected them to neglect informing the Grand Vizier. The Grand Vizier then demanded Sir Sidney's removal from operations involving the Turkish army and the naval flotilla he had commanded. General Hutchinson weakly complied, appointing another captain instead. Edgar, upon learning of this injustice, visited Sir Sidney to resign in protest. However, Sir Sidney convinced Edgar to stay, emphasizing duty over personal feelings. He highlighted the upcoming advance on Cairo and the value of Edgar's knowledge. Edgar agreed to continue his service, realizing the importance of seeing the mission through. The expedition up the Nile, accompanied by native craft loaded with supplies, encountered minimal French resistance.

During the military campaign, the French generals faced little resistance as their troops longed to return to France. Despite some successes in Syria, the arrival of a large British and Turkish force caused despair among the French. Negotiations ensued, leading to the surrender of Cairo and Alexandria. The Indian army played a crucial role in the surrender. General Abercrombie's leadership was commendable, and the sheik's knowledge of the terrain proved valuable. The British troops endured hardships but accomplished a brilliant operation. Lieutenant Blagrove's services were highly praised, and his promotion to naval lieutenant was confirmed. Edgar surprised his father with his grown appearance and naval achievements upon returning to Alexandria after the successful military operations.|"[""1.

Mr. Muller offered to help Mr. Blagrove with a draft for a thousand pounds, a sum from his father's money. Mr. Blagrove, short of timber, was well-off otherwise, having bought spare stores from ships leaving port. Edgar wrote a letter to his father, which was sent with official despatches on the _Carmine_ to England. The fleet, under Lord Keith, sailed to Malta and Gibraltar. A general peace was declared, and the fleet returned to England. The officers were concerned about being laid off, anticipating a long wait for employment. Mr. Addington's retrenchment left the navy unprepared for the war that resumed under Pitt's leadership.
