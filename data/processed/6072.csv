A group of red buoys marked the channel where German destroyers had strategically anchored them. These buoys served as markers for minefields and helped the enemy set their guns for any approaching threats. The situation turned dire when some of our boats were hit by enemy fire. Despite being in the lead, our vessel was a challenging target due to its speed. Amidst the chaos, I found myself amidst steam, aiding scalded comrades. As we struggled to carry the wounded to safety, another explosion rocked the ship, causing havoc. The bridge took a direct hit, but with Captain Ames' guidance, we managed to navigate the chaos and evade further enemy fire.

There was no point in trying to pull the ship out now. I scanned the water for survivors, hoping to rescue some despite the orders against stopping in peril. I disagreed with the rules at that moment. Sadly, I couldn't spot anyone alive. Suddenly, the Germans focused on us, improving their aim. A violent impact threw me off balance as the steering gear was destroyed, leaving us directionless. I improvised by using men to relay commands to the engine room. We maneuvered erratically, confusing the enemy's gunners. Amidst the chaos, a small mine sweeper approached, armed but vulnerable. It bravely towed us to safety despite being hit.

The British cruiser Lawrence, led by Lord Hastings, departed from a Canadian port as part of a convoy taking American troops to France. The northern route was chosen to avoid German submarines. The journey began quietly, hidden from the public and the enemy. The convoy included five transports with soldiers, escorted by warships. The Lawrence, with officers Jack and Frank, was at the front. Suddenly, the ship's guns fired at a suspected German submarine. The crew was on high alert, prepared for any danger.

Shortly after, the two cruisers on the left side, which initially seemed to be following the Lawrence towards the enemy, returned to their positions, along with the ships guarding the transports on that side. In contrast, the two destroyers abruptly changed course and pursued the Lawrence. Following Lord Hastings' orders, the three cruisers on the right side protecting the transports maintained their formation to prevent potential submarine attacks. A cheer erupted from the Lawrence as a British shell hit one of the enemy submarines, causing it to explode. Despite sinking two U-boats, four enemy submarines remained a threat. The British and American ships faced a challenging battle against the remaining submarines. The Angelic, a British destroyer, bravely engaged one of the submarines, ultimately sinking it with precise shots. The enemy retaliated by launching torpedoes at the Lawrence, one of which struck the ship's engine room, causing casualties among the crew. The British fleet intensified its attack on the enemy submarines, but the relentless foes continued to launch torpedoes. Despite sustaining hits, the Lawrence persevered in the fight.|"['1.

The British and American forces were closing in. Lord Hastings, determined to seize the remaining submarines, steered the Lawrence boldly forward, despite the danger of torpedoes. With a swift maneuver, the Lawrence headed straight for the nearest submarine, crushing it with precision. The white flag signaled surrender, and Lord Hastings ordered boats to rescue the German crew before sinking their vessel. As the crew was being rescued, a sudden explosion shattered the submarine into pieces, confirming the treachery of the enemy. The American troops safely arrived in England and were soon transported to France for intensive training alongside their allies. With the mission accomplished, Lord Hastings, Frank, and Jack headed to London for further orders, leaving the Lawrence in the hands of another officer.|['1.

"""Alright,"" said the captain. ""The Albatross is now an armed merchant ship, shuttling between Liverpool and Halifax, carrying mainly food for American troops.

The words had barely left his mouth when a strong gale struck. The Albatross leaned to one side, almost touching the water. Jack, Frank, and the captain clung to the railing tightly to avoid being swept overboard. The ship steadied briefly before tilting sharply to the other side, drenching the deck in water. The boys struggled, gripping anything they could find as the ship swayed unpredictably. Despite the rough weather, they managed to make their way back to the bridge where Captain Glenn, soaked, stood. The storm persisted through the day and into the night, causing concern among the crew. With water seeping in and the ship struggling, Captain Glenn decided to lower the lifeboats. Despite the dangerous sea, they rowed onward, unsure of their location. Eventually, they found shelter in a hidden harbor after a perilous journey.|"['1.

Captain Glenn and his crew found themselves stranded on an unknown coast, suspected to be in South America. Despite the uncertainty, they prepared for potential dangers, aware of the unpredictable nature of the times due to the ongoing war. Equipped with rifles, revolvers, and knives, they secured their provisions and ammunition, ready to face any challenges. As they unloaded the boat, a submarine-like vessel approached with armed men. Keeping calm, Frank took the lead in communicating with the strangers, hoping for a peaceful encounter.

The new group had approached closely. They stopped upon a signal from their apparent leader, armed heavily. A man from the group shouted. They remained still as they neared. Frank noticed their diverse origins - Spanish, English, American, African, Chinese, and Japanese. The young leader, likely American of German descent, spoke in English. He instructed Frank to join them, hinting at a test of intelligence. Suddenly, Captain Glenn, ahead, noticed a large tree clump and suggested they head south. As they turned, sounds of approaching men startled them. Quickly, they hid behind trees with revolvers drawn.

Captain Glenn, Jack, and Williams found themselves in a tense standoff with strangers. The strangers, fearing they would be shot, sought cover behind trees. Despite the tense situation, no shots were fired. Jack, hit in the arm by a bullet, retaliated by disarming one of the strangers. Captain Glenn and Williams followed suit, tossing their weapons aside. With a smile, Jack took action, disarming the man covering his companions.

Two men attacked the boy. Frank quickly drew his revolvers, firing with lightning speed. Jack had always praised Frank's sharpshooting skills. The attackers fell, but more approached. Frank fired again, disarming the boy. His wrists ached as the guns fell. The pirate leader spoke, assuring the boy he wasn't hurt, just disarmed. They were taken aboard the Roger, a submarine docked nearby. Inside, Frank was amazed by the luxurious cabin, a stark contrast to the pirate life. Timothy admired the pirate's success but doubted their resolve. Frank agreed, realizing the pirate life wasn't as glamorous as it seemed.

"""It's a shame,"" he remarked. ""You're quite skilled with a gun. You could be a great help to me. I've received word from my inland wireless station that a ship full of treasure will soon pass through these waters. I plan to capture it. I'd appreciate your assistance.""

""Did you know the Germans have a naval base north of here?"" Captain Jack inquired. ""They use it to supply their raiders and have a dozen submarines. I even managed to 'cut out' one of their submarines five months ago.""

Frank was amazed by the pirate's disregard for laws and civilization but not surprised by the existence of a German submarine base in the Atlantic. Despite suspicions, the base had remained elusive to allied forces.

""I'm not pretending to fight Germany,"" the pirate explained. ""Attacking their ship would be risky. If they find me, I'm done for.""

Frank acknowledged the situation. ""I've noticed the Germans aren't top-notch pirates. By the way, where are we?""

The pirate revealed, ""This island, known as Kaiserland, is our hideout. It's off the usual shipping route and undiscovered on maps. We stumbled upon it after being shipwrecked with fifty men.

Frank excitedly proposed a daring adventure to Jack and Captain Jack, suggesting they become pirates to seek riches and confront Germans. Despite initial tension, the pirate chief eventually offered a truce. They planned to attack a German ship with inside information from a messenger. The friends spent a night on a submarine, strategizing their mission. Captain Jack aimed to immobilize the enemy vessel without sinking it to loot its treasures.

Two hours later, Captain Jack returned to the deck and signaled for Frank to join him. Despite Captain Glenn's presence on board and Jack's higher rank on the Albatross, the pirate chief selected Frank as his first officer. They discussed the transmission of information to Germany from the South American coast, with Jack expressing sympathy for Germany as the underdog. Frank, however, emphasized that the Allies, including the United States, aimed to create a safe world free from Prussian militarism. Captain Jack focused on his pursuit of the German ship for profit, emphasizing the need for swift action. As tensions rose between Captain Jack and Frank, a confrontation ensued, with Frank quickly taking control of the situation by brandishing revolvers.

Jack and Captain Jack were in a fierce battle for control, with Jack holding on grimly despite being underneath. Jack managed to heave the pirate chief into the air, stunning him momentarily. When Captain Jack recovered, he aimed a blow at Jack, who dodged and retaliated with a heavy punch. The two sparred, with Jack landing several blows before the pirate chief rushed in. As the fight continued, Captain Jack realized he had met his match in Jack. Jack struck him with a powerful blow, causing him to collapse.

Frank and Williams were quickly captured and tied up by the pirates. Meanwhile, Jack spotted what seemed to be wreckage in the sea, likely from the German raider. As he tried to make sense of the situation, he was suddenly seized and taken to the deck. Despite being outnumbered, Jack fought back and managed to land some blows. Later, the group found themselves surrounded by armed men and were led inland. The leader mentioned a hidden place in the forest where they would be kept safe until it was time to leave the island for good.

Captain Jack instructed Jackson to guard the prisoners in a windowless room with sturdy oak doors. Despite having candles, escape was futile due to the guards outside. Allen revealed how they overpowered Jackson to escape, armed themselves, and quietly left the building. They found the gates locked but managed to sneak into the stockade. Aware that their absence would soon be noticed, Frank planned to hide in the forest until Captain Jack's men passed by, then return to the fort for food.

Captain Glenn and Williams stood watch at the door to prevent any surprise attacks by pirates. Frank inspected the fort, collecting firearms and ensuring no pirates remained. He also tended to the wounded and respectfully laid the deceased on cots for burial. Meanwhile, Jack operated the wireless room, attempting to send messages into space using the key. Despite his efforts, he couldn't establish contact with any ships or stations in South America. Jack signed each message with his initials, ""J. T.""

The pirates emerged from the trees to meet their leader, Captain Jack. They were surprised by his friendliness towards their enemies but remained silent. Captain Jack gestured for them to gather around. As they formed a circle, Captain Glenn, with his hands on his revolvers, remained vigilant. He suspected Captain Jack's intentions. As the pirates closed in, Frank and Jack also readied their weapons. Captain Jack declared his decision to renounce piracy, urging the men to join him in a mission against the German submarine base. Amidst dissent from a man named Jackson, Captain Jack appealed to the pirates' sense of duty to their countries. Despite the risks, he emphasized the greater reward of fulfilling a noble cause.

Captain Jack confidently proposed a plan to destroy the German submarine base using bombs. Frank assumed control of the submarine, facing initial resistance from the men chosen by Captain Jack, but the pirate chief quickly gained their cooperation. The submarine departed from Kaiserland, with the crew ready to follow Frank's instructions. The land and sea parties' paths converged, and they set off together towards the target. Divided into three groups, Captain Jack, Captain Glenn, and Templeton led the land party towards the base. They planned to plant bombs stealthily and withdraw without confrontation. Jack, armed with a timed bomb, approached the clearing near the enemy settlement, ready to execute the mission. The success of their operation relied on precise execution and avoiding detection.|"[""1.

Jack focused on the spot where Captain Jack's party was about to cross the open area. After staring for five minutes, he spotted shadowy figures sneaking through the clearing. Following Captain Jack's instructions, Frank steered the vessel accurately at five knots. At half past eleven, Frank took caution as he spotted the coastline through the periscope, noticing a row of buildings in the distance. He prepared to drop mines with Williams as the submarine surfaced in what seemed like a man-made harbor. Despite dodging torpedoes, they successfully deployed the mines. The raiders, noticing the Germans preparing for defense, launched an attack. The Germans, assuming a larger force, retreated towards the water's edge.|"[""1.

Captain Jack's group was the first to arrive at the settlement. They fired at the Germans continuously. Following them, Jack and his team were soon joined by Captain Glenn's forces attacking from the side. At precisely 12:15, Captain Jack threw a bomb forward. Both Jack and Captain Glenn then ordered a retreat simultaneously. As they retreated, the Germans shot at them. Suddenly, Captain Jack fell, wounded by a German bullet. Despite the pain, he followed his men. The Germans initially thought the retreat was a trick, but eventually, they realized it wasn't and started pursuing. The pirates, realizing Jack was left behind, turned back to rescue him. Despite the danger, they rushed back to help. Explosions ensued, causing chaos. Miraculously, Captain Jack remained unharmed amidst the destruction. The pirates, with Jack and Captain Glenn, fled to safety as the environment around them crumbled.|"['1.
