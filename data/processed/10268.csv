Despite her worries about her father's reaction to the bills, Patty felt a sense of guilt for overspending and betraying trust.

The horticulture department can be both fun and profitable. At a fair, there were beautiful pin-cushions and trinkets shaped like fruits and vegetables. Mr. Hepworth suggested a loan exhibition where members could borrow interesting items from friends for a display. Patty and her friends planned side shows with funny acts like 'Punch and Judy' and fortune-telling gipsies. They decided on a parade with people in eccentric costumes. The fair would be held at the old Warner place, with rooms showcasing a loan exhibition, domestic items, and horticultural displays. Committees were formed to manage different areas, ensuring a smooth operation. The fair was set for two days with perfect weather. Patty, dressed as the Queen of Hearts, led the candy kitchen.
