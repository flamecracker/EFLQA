"""Good evening, Mrs. Bennett,"" greeted the scoutmaster with a pleasant surprise. The spider was in his web, but he hid his excitement. ""You're just in time for dinner. We're having corn wiggles; have you ever tried them?"" Mrs. Bennett listened as the scoutmaster shared the day's events. A scout approached, saluted, and handed him a paper with river water temperature and a weather forecast. The scoutmaster's questions showed care for the boys' well-being.

From the group near the fire, Connover stepped forward with a sense of guilt. Mrs. Bennett embraced him, though her expression hinted at some displeasure. Her worry was now being replaced by recollections of Connover's disobedience. A few scouts eager to help and share their camp experiences joined them. Mr. Ellsworth proudly showed them their first aid kit back in his tent, boasting about their superior care abilities compared to the village. Mrs. Bennett, hesitant to show approval before tasting the food, felt a pang of disappointment towards her son. Despite his disobedience, she noticed the boys were understanding towards Connover, which touched her. As they prepared for a special meal, Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Ellsworth strolled away from camp.

The bugle's cheerful call announced supper was served. Scouts gathered at the long table under the dimming foliage. A guest approached, masking humiliation with grace. Mr. Ellsworth and the guest emerged from the woods. The troop celebrated its birthday, honoring two scouts with pink ribbons. Roy humorously presented the ribbons, symbolizing brotherhood and a new beginning. Later, Mary Temple rushed to the camp, seeking help for a robbery and shootings at her house. Startled, she found Tom Slade present, unaware of his father's involvement. Mary recounted the harrowing events, seeking aid from the scouts.|"[""1.

In the woods, Roy lit a lantern, dividing the troop into two groups. One readied a stretcher, assisting Doc Carson, while the other watched Tom at the wireless apparatus. Roy stood by, the others speaking quietly. Tom seemed detached, adjusting the spark gap. He signaled in Morse Code with expertise, a smile crossing his face. Mary admired Tom's skill and aloofness. As they left the woods, Mary felt awe for Tom, who was signaling for help. Tom, Pee-wee, and Charlie walked with purpose, hinting at foreboding. Mary shared details of a robbery at Five Oaks, where Tom's message had summoned help. The doctor's arrival was met with relief, but Tom had disappeared, leaving behind a sense of loyalty and mystery.|"['1.

When the doctor was brought around, he was found still in that position and had to be lifted gently away. The news that the wound was not fatal did not seem to affect his composure at all. It wasn't the usual scout way to send a young girl on an errand, and it was definitely not the norm to summon John Temple so abruptly. Tom was a law unto himself, and even Mr. Ellsworth didn't intervene. The owner of Five Oaks appeared with his daughter by his side. Tom, who had knocked his hat off, stood up to face him. Tom's voice trembled with earnestness as he explained his loyalty to the troop and how his father's influence kept him from going astray.
