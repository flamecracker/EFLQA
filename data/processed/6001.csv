Mr. Maynard traveled through Bear Forks and upon suggesting a ranch there, he asked for immediate settlement. A mother, unable to accompany her daughters for the summer, invited Polly to join them as a friend and advisor rather than a tutor. Polly's expenses will be covered, and her tutoring salary for Nolla will aid Paul in college. Polly's mother, considering the proposal, recalls John Brewster's connection to the girls and Pebbly Pit. Polly's mother reflects on the potential benefits of having the girls stay, hoping it will provide insights into John's relationship with one of the girls. Polly, while her mother contemplates, imagines the girls visiting Pebbly Pit from Denver and Chicago.

Mr. Maynard's wife, Mrs. Maynard, sneered quietly as she understood her husband's desire for a simpler life compared to the extravagant social scene she had built.

Sary remained silent as she observed Mrs. Brewster approach the window and pull a cord, causing the decorative shade to rise and let in more light. Impressed by the modern convenience, Sary expressed her amazement at the new contraptions in the house. Mrs. Brewster then excused herself to start dinner, inviting Sary to join her in the kitchen when ready. Sary, in her calico house-dress, planned to discuss the poor mattress quality. During dinner, the family and Jeb, the hired man, gathered in the kitchen. Despite being religious, Sam Brewster's lengthy grace didn't align with his liberal nature. When soup was served in a new way, Sary was puzzled by the unfamiliar customs.

Sary didn't respond to the news but showed her annoyance towards the newcomers by suggesting throwing their trunks into Wyoming for the Native Americans.

A seasoned prospector in the Klondike shared his thrilling adventure with me. He was an honest prospector but not very successful. After returning from Alaska, he had to work in Denver to earn his fare back home. With his skills as an engineer and mineralogist, he joined a crew of mining engineers to inspect the Pagoda Peak section and Lost Lake district. Confident of finding gold, he stayed behind when the crew returned to Denver. After patient digging, he discovered a rich lode of red-gold in a dangerous and remote area.

I often visited the old man who lived alone in his cabin, with only his loyal dog, Patsy, by his side. The locals thought he was crazy for believing in a gold mine that no one had ever seen. When I found him one day, unconscious and in need of help, I realized how sick he truly was. Despite my efforts to assist him, he passed away, leaving me a surprising inheritance in his will. Patsy, unable to bear the loss of his master, also passed away soon after. They were buried together, a fitting end for two inseparable friends.

In a short time, the riders arrived at a smaller park with towering rocks piercing the sky instead of trees. Along the trail, lodge-pole pines lined the way toward Grizzly Slide, a glacier rarely changing shape like other peaks in summer.

Polly carefully led her burros, Noddy and Choko, along a narrow ledge on the mountain-side to a cave. The wind howled and a blizzard raged around them. Polly beckoned her friends, Barbara and Anne, to follow. They descended cautiously, guided by Polly's instructions. Once in the cave, they realized they needed firewood to stay warm and keep wild animals away. Polly used an ax to chop pine, which Noddy carried back to the cave. The girls worked together to gather enough wood to create a fire. As they made their way back, a fallen pine obstructed their path, but Polly saw it as a miracle, providing them with the wood they needed.

Smoke and sparks deter wild animals as they instinctively fear forest fires. Despite this, they do not comprehend that humans intentionally create fires to keep them at bay. In an outdoor setting, Polly strategically allocates sleeping arrangements, ensuring safety. Exhausted, the group settles down near the crackling pine fires.

Tom Latimer brought his younger brother Jim to visit in Chicago, but Eleanor never expected Jim to be close by in the summer. If she had known, she would have paid more attention to him during their previous meeting. Eleanor and Polly discussed the idea of having John bring Tom along for a visit. Eleanor suggested that John would likely divide his time between spending time with Anne and working on the mine. Polly was left with much to ponder about Eleanor's words and decided to join the rest of the group. Polly and Simms had to be discreet in their communication to ensure secrecy about their plans, so they devised a coded message for John to bring Tom and his friend to join the party. Mrs. Brewster suggested setting up temporary sleeping arrangements for the boys in the loft or a tent near the terrace for a more comfortable stay than what they were used to during the summer.|"['1.
