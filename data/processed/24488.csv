"Rollo, a twelve-year-old, is accompanied by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Holiday, on a journey through Europe. His younger brother, Thanny, and cousin, Jane, who was adopted by the Holidays, are also part of the adventure. Rollo's uncle, Mr. George, joins them. The group explores various places in Italy, such as an orange garden, churches in Florence, and the city of Naples. When traveling in Italy, tourists often opt for a unique mode of transportation called a ""vetturino,"" which is a carriage man that takes care of all travel arrangements.

In Florence, market women and flower girls use little fire jars to keep warm in winter while attending to their businesses. Artists in palaces and galleries have these jars by their side as they work on copying great masterpieces or drawing from ancient statues. Another interesting use of these jars in Florence is to warm beds when someone is sick. They hang the jar inside a wooden cage, turn it upside down, and place it in the bed to warm it. This tradition stems from the Middle Ages when people invested in building and decorating churches due to the instability of the times. While Mr. George explored the art galleries, Rollo enjoyed observing the city's customs and scenes. The prevalence of paintings and sculptures in Italy is due to the historical investment in church construction and decoration during the Middle Ages.|"['1.

This statue can be seen in the foreground of a painting, set against the backdrop of Florence. While Mr. George immersed himself in the city's churches and art galleries, Rollo expressed a desire to continue their journey towards Naples. They discussed various travel options, considering routes via seaports and carriages.

After leaving Tuscany, the group entered the Papal States in the center of Italy with Rome as its capital. This country is under the rule of the pope, and the Catholic religion holds supreme authority here.

Pompeii and Herculaneum are ancient cities near Naples, Italy, buried by volcanic eruptions. Pompeii has been more extensively excavated than Herculaneum due to its softer covering of ashes and cinders. Herculaneum, buried under hard lava, requires deep digging to access. Both cities were discovered by men digging wells. Treasures like statues and art found in the excavations are displayed in a museum in Naples. The Grotto of Posilipo, a historic tunnel near Naples, offers a unique experience. Rollo leads his family to a balcony and rooftop, offering a panoramic view.

Rosie gazed eastward, taking in the stunning view of the bay's shore, lined with towns and villages, and the lush slopes of Vesuvius in the distance. Villas dotted the green fields, and smoke billowed from the volcano's peaks. Using an opera glass as a spy-glass, Rollo showed Rosie the smoke more clearly. They observed the highest house on the mountain's ridge and the steamers and boats in the bay. Mrs. Gray, intrigued by Rosie's account, went up to the roof to see for herself. The group marveled at the mountain and the fiery glow from the crater. Despite waiting for days for clear weather, an opportunity arose for Mr. George to plan the ascent of Vesuvius with Rollo and the family.|"['1.

Philippe described a unique way to ascend the mountain using a chair carried by four men. He explained how the chair was lifted onto their shoulders, making the ride feel as smooth as being carried in a room. Philippe shared that the men who carry passengers up the mountain are paid well for their efforts. Rosie's initial fear turned into admiration for these men upon learning about their hard work. Philippe assured the group that a guide ensures their safety on the mountain, highlighting the importance of caution. The plan was set for the expedition, including transportation, chair bearers, and animals for the ascent. Mr. George entrusted Philippe to handle all payments during the journey to avoid any issues.

The carriage rode through Naples, offering a view of bustling streets with people carrying goods on their heads, cooking, and working on various trades. The sidewalks were filled with families engaged in daily activities. Josie mentioned the beggars crowding around pedestrians. The road led to a series of villages along the shore, with people traveling to and from Naples. The carriage eventually stopped at an inn, surrounded by a noisy crowd of beggars and drivers. Mr. George and Mrs. Gray ignored the beggars and entered the inn, followed by the children. Philippe lit candles for the group, and they descended stone steps into a building. As they entered, a group of visitors emerged from below, each holding a candle, creating a unique and picturesque sight.|['1.

The guide spoke briefly with Philippe in Italian before Philippe led his group down the wide stairs. As they descended and turned, a light akin to daylight emerged, growing brighter until they reached a large circular opening in the rock. The light illuminated a moss-covered platform and walls, where Mrs. Gray collected plants. Moving down more steps, they entered dark chambers hewn from the rock, revealing remnants of an ancient theater. The party explored further, finding old arches, columns, and frescoes. The guide, mainly speaking Italian with a mix of English, pointed out original features in the ancient site. The exploration concluded, and they returned to the surface. Mr. George led them back to the waiting carriage, passing through vineyards and groves on the mountain road. Mrs. Gray's selfless gesture impressed Mr. George, who decided to invite her and Rosie on future excursions.|"['1.

As the carriage ascended, the views around them expanded. The Bay of Naples with its mountainous islands and a line of hamlets along the shore unfolded before their eyes. In the distance, Naples and the Castle of St. Elmo perched on a rocky summit came into view. The travelers glimpsed fertile valleys between lofty peaks, marred only by recent lava flows. The Hermitage, a white stone building on a mountain spur, awaited them. The grounds, with vineyards and mulberry trees, looked inviting. Upon arrival, a commotion ensued with beggars, musicians, and guides clamoring for attention. Ignoring the chaos, Mr. George led his companions inside. The monk, in traditional attire, served the guests in desolate stone rooms. Philippe arranged a table, and the group explored the surroundings before descending for their next adventure.|['1.

Philippe covered the chair with a shawl for Rosie to sit in, and the men lifted it onto their shoulders. Rosie felt a bit scared as she rose high into the air, but she smiled down at her mother once she felt secure. Rollo and Josie rode donkeys while Mr. George walked. The group followed a winding path along the ridge towards the mountain's base. The travelers could see the towering cone ahead. As they ascended, they passed rough lava streams. When they reached a resting spot, Rosie was lifted onto the bearers' shoulders again. The party continued climbing, with Rollo leading the way and Josie being helped up by strapmen. Mr. George stayed close to Rosie, ensuring her safety. Despite the rough demeanor of the men, Mr. George remained calm and refused their demands for money, stating that Philippe would handle the payments.|"['1.

When Rollo reached the top of the mountain, he saw a huge cloud of white vapor rising into the sky nearby. He wanted to rush closer to the crater but decided to wait for the rest of the group. The bearers put down the chair, and everyone gathered around Mr. George asking for tips. Mr. George calmly helped Rosie out of her chair, and they followed the guide towards the crater. Let's take a moment to understand what a crater is and how it forms. A crater is a large pit on top of a volcano caused by the ground sinking due to cooling and shrinking of the molten material below. Just like lead shrinks when cooling in a mold, the lava inside a volcano cools, causing the top to sink and form a crater. Steam escapes from small openings in the crater, forming a visible vapor column.|['1.

After a while, the inside of the mountain heats up once more. Steam and hot lava start to escape from one of the vents in the crater's base. The lava becomes hotter with each eruption, enlarging the opening by melting and blowing away its sides. The lava accumulates around the hole, forming a mound like a small dome. This cone, rising in the crater's base, vents the steam while other openings get blocked by lava. Vesuvius, during Rollo's visit, had two craters with black cones emitting molten matter. Visitors observed the colorful cliffs formed by sulfur deposits. The crater's floor was covered in black, wave-like lava, with a large cone emitting steam and red-hot stones. Despite initial fears of the cliffs collapsing, the party watched explosions of stones and lava at the cone's top. The guide then led them to another crater with similar volcanic activity.|"['1.

While they stood on the narrow ridge at the edge of the crater, a guide led two young men down the slope. Mr. George saw the descent was safe as it was a guided path. Rollo and Josie followed the young men down the sandy track with ease. The floor of the crater was covered in black lava, surprising them that it was solid enough to walk on. The guide confidently stepped onto the lava, followed by the group. The lava was hard on the surface but hot underneath. Rollo and Josie bought lava pieces from local boys near the crater's center. As they ventured closer to the cone, steam obscured their view, worrying Rosie. Mr. George reassured her, trusting the guides' expertise. Soon, the vapor cleared, revealing Rollo and Josie returning safely.|"['1.

Mr. George, a guide, left Rosie with Rollo and Josie to explore a volcanic crater. The group found a spot where locals cooked using hot steam and gases from the crater. Rollo bought eggs cooked in the steam. Mr. George ventured down the crater to explore further while the children observed two students using a metallic barometer to measure the mountain's height. The barometer measures air pressure, which decreases as altitude increases. By comparing pressure readings at the base and summit, the height of the mountain can be calculated. The students were kind enough to explain this to Rollo, offering a fascinating lesson on how technology is used to measure natural phenomena like mountain heights.|"['1.

Mr. George was keen on learning about the barometer, despite never having seen one before. He was fascinated by Rollo's description and decided to visit the instrument. The students warmly welcomed him, forming a quick friendship. They planned to stay on the mountain until night to observe it differently and invited Mr. George to join. Rollo, though unable to go, supported Mr. George's visit. Mr. George appreciated Rollo's offer and agreed to let him lead the group back. He promised to return to the students if Mrs. Gray allowed. After exploring the crater's edge and collecting specimens, they descended easily down a sandy slope. Mrs. Gray, feeling safe with the children and Philippe, urged them to go home, expressing interest in their adventures. Rollo later informed Mrs. Gray about a development regarding their plans for Pompeii, showing some concern.|"[""1.

Rosie picked up a guidebook from the table and flipped to a map of Pompeii. She hoped the town had few streets to make finding Mr. George easier. Unfortunately, the map revealed a complex layout with many intersecting streets. Rosie closed the book, thinking it might hinder rather than help Rollo's plan. Mrs. Gray suggested taking a carriage to explore Pompeii and Herculaneum. In Naples, carriages were abundant, with eager coachmen offering rides. Rollo and Josie set out to find a carriage, eventually selecting one with a good pair of horses. The coachman, upon their approach, opened the carriage door. The boys ignored the other coachmen's calls and engaged the selected carriage for a trip to Pompeii.|"['1.

"""How much?"" asked Rollo. ""Quanto"" is the Italian term for ""how much."" By saying ""Quanto,"" Rollo used his right hand fingers to indicate to the coachman that he wanted to know how many piastres the fare would be. The coachman hesitated briefly but then agreed to the regular price when he saw the boys were ready to find another carriage. They got in, and the coachman drove them to the hotel. The road to Pompeii was initially the same as the one to Vesuvius, passing through Naples and along the bay. The sides of the mountain were fertile with vineyards and groves, interspersed with streams of lava. In Pompeii, they were greeted by a man in uniform who seemed pleased to see them, and they began their exploration of the open village of ruined houses."|"['1.

In ancient times, houses were structured differently from modern homes due to the absence of windows and chimneys. The people of Pompeii didn't have chimneys because the climate was mild, and they rarely needed fires. When they did, they used open vessels with small fires inside. Windows were lacking because glass was not easily made then. Openings in the houses served as windows, but they needed to be sheltered to keep out wind and rain. Rooms often opened into porticos, with a central open area called an _impluvium_ to let in light and air. Some houses had multiple courts, with gardens and subterranean chambers. Skeletons found in one chamber showed how people were buried during a volcanic eruption. Visitors today can still see these ancient structures and imagine how people lived in them.|"['1.

In Pompeii, the discovery of a female skeleton adorned with jewelry suggested she was the homeowner's wife who perished trying to save her valuables. Most inhabitants escaped, but a brave sentinel stayed at his post and died. The town had narrow streets with unique shops like barbers' and wine shops. The Forum, a public square, was surrounded by ruins of temples and edifices. The theatres and amphitheatre outside the walls were points of interest. While Mr. George and the students focused on theatres and temples, Mrs. Gray and the children were intrigued by houses and shops. The baker's shop with an intact oven and stone hand mills was a highlight. Although the museum in Naples houses the artifacts found, exploring Pompeii's shops and houses firsthand was more captivating.|"[""1.

Mrs. Gray explained that the group's interests at the museum differed. The students wanted to focus on antiquities, Latin and Greek inscriptions, and monuments. In contrast, Mrs. Gray preferred paintings, jewelry, and household items from Pompeii. Mr. George initially hesitated but agreed to split up to accommodate both interests. Rollo arranged for a carriage to take Mrs. Gray and the children to the museum while Mr. George met with the students. The group met at the museum at ten o'clock. Rollo assisted the ladies into the carriage through crowded Naples streets. Upon arrival, they were greeted by a guard at the entrance. Inside, they marveled at the grand hall with columns and staircases leading to different museum sections. Each section was guarded by men near iron gates with inscriptions labeling the departments.|"['1.

At the museum, visitors had to leave their canes and umbrellas at a small room near the entrance. This was to prevent any accidental damage to the artifacts on display. Rollo helped Mrs. Gray by handing over her parasol to the attendants for safekeeping. Each item was tagged with a number for identification. As more visitors arrived, they followed the same procedure of depositing their belongings before entering the museum. Inside, each section had its own locked gate, which was opened by a staff member for visitors. Rollo had prepared the correct amount of money for the entrance fee. The rooms containing tools and household items from Pompeii caught the attention of Rollo and his companions. They marveled at the ancient artifacts, noting both similarities and differences to modern-day objects.|"['1.

"In ancient Pompeii, many floors were made of mosaic, using colored stones set in cement to create intricate designs. Some mosaics depicted animals or elaborate patterns, while others showcased battle scenes with countless stones. These masterpieces were carefully removed and displayed in museums. One notable mosaic featured a dog with the warning ""CAVE CANEM"" or ""LOOK OUT FOR THE DOG"" in Latin. Intricate vases and jars adorned with various scenes provided insight into ancient life. Visitors marveled at the detailed engravings on jewelry and gems found in Pompeii and Herculaneum. Mrs. Gray and her children explored the museum, including the fascinating Gem Room, filled with these precious artifacts.

Rollo and Josie enjoyed exploring the bustling streets of Naples, where lower-class families engaged in various trades and activities outdoors. They observed cabinet makers polishing tables, iron bedsteads being forged, turners crafting with lathes, and women knitting or sewing. The most fascinating area for Rollo and Josie was where sailors lived, with fishing boats lining the beach and fishermen's families working and relaxing nearby. Despite the picturesque scenes, the sight of many impoverished and beggarly individuals marred the experience. The streets were filled with diseased and impoverished people begging for alms, even though Naples had established hospitals for their care. The constant presence of beggars, some genuine and some impostors, made leisurely walks challenging for visitors, as they were incessantly besieged for money.|['1.

Mrs. Gray understood the situation well. If everyone refused to give money to beggars in public, the practice of showcasing misery in Naples would end. She, Mr. George, and Rollo didn't give money to beggars and were rarely bothered. Rollo once gave a piece of cake to a hungry dog. Mr. George suggested Rollo take the ladies on an excursion to Pozzuoli and Solfatara. Rollo agreed and planned a trip to Virgil's Tomb, Grotto of Posilipo, and more. The next day, Rollo and Josie found a carriage and drove Mrs. Gray, Rosie, and themselves out of town. They passed by the public gardens and headed towards the Grotto of Posilipo, a famous subterranean passage. Rosie marveled at the journey until they reached the grand entrance of the grotto.|['1.

Rollo and his party visited the grotto, wide enough for two carriages, illuminated by lamps, bustling with people and carriages. Along the rock walls, curious structures and openings were visible. A chapel with an altar and a priest asking for donations stood on one side, while an ancient monument with a Latin inscription was on the other. They stopped at Virgil's Tomb entrance, where a gate led to stone steps ascending to a vineyard with a stunning view. Descending back to the grotto mouth, they explored caverns and reached Virgil's Tomb, a peculiar spot. Passing through the grotto, they encountered carts, donkeys, and foot passengers. Emerging into open land, they admired the scenery before reaching the ancient seaport town of Puteoli, once crucial for ships and where Apostle Paul landed on his way to Rome.|"['1.

Puteoli, now known as Pozzuoli, was a significant place in ancient times. The group was on their way to see the ruins of the immense amphitheater, but first, they were headed to Solfatara. As the carriage approached Puteoli, they encountered a bridge where many people, including guides and beggars, gathered. The commotion startled Rosie briefly. Rollo selected a boy as their guide, and the carriage moved on, leaving the noisy crowd behind. Eventually, they reached a lane where they had to continue on foot. They entered the crater, a circular valley surrounded by high ridges, with white soil indicating exposure to fire. Inside, an old man demonstrated the hollow ground with a large stone. They proceeded to a spot where dense steam emerged from a cavern, with a roaring sound. After observing the steam and hot earth, they moved on to see an alum manufacturing site within the crater.|"[""1.

After leaving the site, the group followed the road's path even further, eventually returning to the entrance of the crater. They paid the guide, exited through the gate, and headed back down the lane to their carriage. Once inside the carriage, they drove back towards town, making various turns until they arrived at a large wooden gate. A man in uniform unlocked the gate, allowing them to enter. Before them stood the walls of a massive ruin, with curved walls and vast arches. The custodian led them through the ruins, including an oval amphitheater with stone seats rising high around a central arena. The guide explained that the structure could accommodate up to forty thousand people and detailed how wild beasts were released into the arena for spectacles. The group also visited the Temple of Serapis, partially submerged in water due to geological changes over time.|"['1.

On the shore, there lies a fascinating ruin partially submerged underwater, with columns and structures still visible. Visitors can explore this ancient site using a raised stone pathway provided by the government. Rollo and his group gained entry through a gate guarded by a custodian and walked along the raised path, observing the submerged marble floor and columns of the temple. Evidence suggests that these ruins were once deeper underwater and resurfaced. Rollo wished to explore the underwater ruins by boat but refrained from suggesting it, knowing Mrs. Gray's concerns. Mrs. Gray was pleased with the excursion and encouraged Rollo to plan more trips. The next day, Rollo surprised Mr. George with an unplanned excursion to Castellamare, a charming town by the bay known for its hot springs and naval base. They found carriages ready for coastal and mountain excursions, offering trips to Sorrento, Pæstum, Amalfi, and other destinations.|"['1.

Rollo carefully chose a carriage amidst the noisy chaos of coachmen and carriages on the street. After selecting the best one, he negotiated a deal in broken Italian to go to Sorrento and back. With a guide on the box beside the coachman and Josie inside, they embarked on a splendid ride along the coast. The road hugged the mountains and offered stunning views of the sea and terraced vineyards. As they approached the valley of Sorrento, they beheld groves of citrus trees and countless villas. Upon arrival, they explored a garden, indulging in sweet oranges. After a leisurely hour, they left, generously tipping the gardener. They continued to wander in Sorrento, even venturing to the cliffs overlooking the sea.|['1.
