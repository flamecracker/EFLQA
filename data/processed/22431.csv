Dalzell quickly got up and dashed down the aisle, with Dave close behind him. They were followed by a pale young man in a gray suit. Soon, they all came to a stop as they encountered a group of British guards on the brightly lit street. Dave suspected the waiter had helped the man in the green hat escape. The man, named Cushing, revealed he was part of a secret American service and had an important document stolen from him. He needed to reach the American admiral urgently.

Gibraltar's harbor is small but could once hold a large fleet securely within its confines. In the past, the British fleet could have hidden there, protected by the fortress's guns that could have defeated any approaching navy. However, modern threats from the heights of Algeciras in Spain, just seven miles away, pose a risk. If Spain or another power controlled these heights, they could dominate Gibraltar's harbor. Despite this, Gibraltar's strong military history endures. In a different scenario, American officers faced a mix-up during a dramatic incident involving stolen government papers and a secret code. The stolen code, although old and no longer in use, highlights the importance of secure communication methods in diplomatic and military affairs.|"[""1.

"Shortly after the signal was given, the officers took their seats. Following instructions to the attentive Filipino boys who were serving as mess attendants, a lively conversation filled the room. The executive officer, the captain's trusted aide, sometimes has valid reasons for not disclosing the ship's destination. In such cases, his claim of not knowing is merely a polite way of saying it's not prudent to reveal the port. ""I will share our likely destination with you. We are headed to a port on the Riviera, possibly Nice or Monte Carlo. The final decision is pending from the admiral,"" he explained. The Riviera, a slender coastal area between mountains and the sea along the Gulf of Genoa, includes popular spots like Nice and Monte Carlo. While Monte Carlo is famous for its gambling scene, some officers joked about the government sending them there to spend their money. However, one officer, Dave, expressed his intent not to gamble but to explore the renowned destination. The navigating officer added that the Riviera extends from Nice to Genoa, with a rocky shoreline requiring numerous tunnels for the railway. As the discussion unfolded, the paymaster addressed a previous issue of an unexplained shortage in the mess-fund, which led to further deliberation among the officers."|"[""1.

Lieutenant Commander Wales suggested a straightforward solution to cover the thirty-three dollar deficit in the mess - levy a small assessment on each member. Barnes proposed a fine for asking unanswerable questions during dinner on Tuesday. Dan planned to make Barnes the victim of his own scheme. However, Dave warned Dan about underestimating Barnes' cleverness. The conversation shifted to Monaco's history of piracy and toll collection. Darrin expressed pity for those who gamble away their money in Monaco's casinos. The officers looked forward to visiting Monaco that evening. The executive officer announced a penalty for asking unanswerable questions, but clarified exceptions for inquiries about the food.

At the casino, groups of men and women gathered around tables, hoping to leave richer but likely to depart poorer. Dave pointed out the greed and desperation on their faces, emphasizing the dangers of gambling. A man in panic, his face pale and contorted, exemplified the consequences of losing. Despite the distress, the allure of gambling kept the players fixated. An attendant discreetly approached a young woman, offering assistance. The woman, with a valuable necklace but limited funds, lamented the pawnbrokers' unfair deals.

The order to return to the fleet had been given, and all but Darrin, Dalzell, and Jetson, along with Seaman Runkle, were already on their ships. The Admiral awaited the arrival of the launch carrying the remaining crew members before setting sail. The Captain informed them of urgent communications from Paris for Admiral Timworth. They were instructed to accompany him to the fleet commander's quarters promptly. Ensign Darrin revealed a crucial piece of evidence regarding a plot against Great Britain and their country. The evidence, a receipted bill for storage batteries intended for a submarine, was obtained through deceptive means by the plotters. The group discussed the plotters' likely plan to sink a British battleship using the submarine and torpedoes, emphasizing the importance of vigilance in the Grand Harbor of Malta.|"[""1.

The plotters must understand that sinking a British ship wouldn't make the English suspect our nation. Dave argued that the British might think it was the work of some officers and men in our Navy who disliked England. The tension of the war is affecting the British deeply. Admiral Timworth pointed out a flaw in Dave's reasoning, suggesting that the British could believe a German submarine sneaked into Malta's harbor. Dave proposed that the plotters might use an American torpedo to frame us for sinking a British battleship. Admiral Timworth, after considering this, feared that plotters might provoke England into war with us. He decided to head to Malta to stop any such plot. Admiral Barkham was shocked to learn of this plan. He believed only madmen would attempt such a horrific act without government support.|"['1.

Surigny explained the devious plot to sink a British battleship at Malta. The scheme involved a hidden submarine with American torpedo tubes. The craft, thought lost, was actually concealed along the Mediterranean shore. Maltese traitors towed it to the area for the attack. The plotters used a Russian yacht with fake papers to evade suspicion. The yacht supposedly sold to Japanese buyers for trade between the U.S. and Japan. However, two passengers were imposters - a Filipino deserter and a man pretending to be a Russian prince. Dave and the Count realized the intricate plan and the danger it posed. The treacherous plot aimed to blame American naval men for the sinking, orchestrated by enemies with no loyalty but greed.|['1.

The distance to the middle of North Channel was calculated to be around fifteen miles. The plan was for the yacht not to spot them during daylight. At night, the two launches would come closer, with Whyte serving as the pilot. Ensign Dave, equipped with night glasses, monitored the British launch's movements to adjust his course. Ropes with grappling hooks were thrown, securing the yacht's rail. Sailormen climbed aboard, and rope ladders were set up. Dave and his crew swiftly boarded the yacht. While exploring below deck, Dave suspected the skipper might only have a few crew members. Despite the tense situation, Dave remained calm and focused. With heightened senses, Dave noticed a peculiar disturbance in the water, which turned out to be a periscope rising to the surface.|"['1.

Darrin's signal had been acknowledged by both fleets, indicating that the submarine had been spotted. The agreed-upon signal of three blue rockets had been sent. Runkle, manning the gun, received the range from Ensign Darrin. After firing, Runkle anxiously watched the water for the splash to gauge his accuracy. The searchlight illuminated the target as Runkle maintained his focus. Despite his excellent gunnery skills, Darrin observed Runkle's frustration at missing the target. It was crucial to sink the submarine promptly. Darrin considered following the bubbles to track the enemy but ultimately had to slow down due to lack of visibility. As the Navy launch continued cautiously, Darrin strategized with his crew to prevent the submarine from doubling back undetected. Despite some missed shots, the crew remained determined to locate and neutralize the submarine.|"['1.

During the third launch, Dave gave Ensign Sutton the order to approach the shore slowly and keep an eye out for bubbles and the enemy craft. He warned not to use the searchlights without permission and planned to follow the submarine if its conning tower stayed above water. A shot from the one-pounder hit the mark, but they prepared for another shot. Inside the submarine, Dave called out in French, trying to get the crew to obey. The body of Emil Gortchky was identified, and his crew members were taken as prisoners. Dave was congratulated for his success, and later, he married his high school sweetheart Belle Meade.
