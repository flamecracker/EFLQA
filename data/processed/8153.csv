Half a minute later, a series of loud blasts echoed through the camp, stirring the laborers from their tents. Many had slept so deeply that the dynamite noise seemed part of their dreams. But the shrill whistle signaled seriousness. Tom anticipated the situation, explaining to the group under the torches how the quicksand had shifted despite a solid foundation. Reade expressed concern about the need for a mile-long suspension bridge to avoid treacherous quicksand patches. Aware of the risks, he instructed Bell to select twenty-one reliable men for night watch duty. Tom, feeling regret for the situation, suspected foul play by Chicago contractors. Tom and Harry checked on the watchmen, ensuring alertness. The night concluded with the general manager and engineers retiring, pending approval from Jim Duff. Tom emphasized the importance of honesty to reinstate any laborers who were genuinely absent.|['1.

Overcoming a quicksand is a challenging task that requires careful planning based on the specific conditions of the area. Sometimes, the best approach is to build a suspension bridge over the quicksand, supported by strong pillars. In other cases, filling the quicksand with new sand or loam gradually can create a solid foundation. Another method involves laying logs in a transverse network and allowing the structure to sink slowly as the quicksand shifts. Steel piles filled with cement can also be driven into the ground to block side drift. Tom and his team are determined to conquer the Man-killer quicksand using innovative methods, despite facing challenges from rival groups. Their goal is not just about money but about overcoming the obstacle and making the area safe for everyone.|['1.

Tom assured the physician that all necessary medical attention should be given, and any expenses would be covered by the company. The physician commended Reade for his compassion and promised to return the man in good health.

A railway worker swiftly signaled as an engineer in his cab responded with a short whistle blast. The train, carrying steel rails for construction, began moving after the lever was switched. The load of ten flat cars, each holding ten tons of rails, totaled one hundred and fifty tons. This weight pressed on the new track over the Man-killer area, where laborers had been working for two weeks. Despite the once treacherous quicksand, a secure roadbed now lay. Tom Reade's unexpected actions surprised his colleagues, showing confidence in his work. Harry Hazelton, though not responsible for monitoring the tracks, grew anxious as the train crossed the area.

George Ashby, however, was not easily scared. He quickly saw that the car didn't have armed men. So, he moved his horse out of the way and aimed at Reade, shooting less often. He didn't waste shots on Hazelton. The riders from Arizona were getting closer. Some drew guns and shot at the hotel owner, but the distance was too far for accurate shots. In just thirty seconds, Ashby would have been shot down. Suddenly, he turned his horse sharply to the right, rode back without shooting, and Reade was safe. Ashby claimed to be bulletproof, saying any bullet shot at him would bounce back. Dr. Furniss was called to handle the situation. The men took Ashby to the office, where the doctor revealed that Ashby was insane and needed to be taken to an asylum. Ashby broke free, knocked down his captors, and rode off at full speed.|['1.

"Jake, ride back a few hundred yards and keep a sharp lookout,"" suggested Duff calmly. ""The pursuers may come in cars. Let's end things here quickly and leave only lifeless bodies for the rescuers to find."" ""Gentlemen, you might as well take off your masks on this warm evening,"" proposed Jim Duff. The masks came off. Reade and Hazelton glanced at their captors discreetly, trying not to show too much interest. ""I didn't think there were such dishonest gamblers,"" Tom said in surprise. ""It's hard to believe. How can a man be fair and honorable if he won't work but lives off others' earnings? Does that have anything to do with honor?"" ""Stop that talk, you young troublemaker!"" commanded Duff, approaching Tom angrily. Duff's usual polite manner was gone. His eyes showed anger as he clenched his fist and hit Reade in the face, knocking him down. One of the men pulled Tom up. ""Talking about fairness,"" Tom said, ""I demand it now. Duff, you hit me when I couldn't defend myself. If you're not a coward, free my hands - then hit me again if you dare."" ""I knew it,"" Reade said sadly.

"""Am I the leader here or not?"" boldly demanded Duff. ""Weren't my interests the first attacked by these newcomers? Didn't you all come out tonight to help me with my problem? And weren't you also here to seek revenge for the harm done to poor George Ashby's success?""

Duff's command to bring Reade and Hazelton under the trees was followed by Bodson and Moore, who kept a close eye on the situation. In a tense silence, Duff placed the two engineers under the trees and tied a lariat around their necks. Bodson urged Duff to face the consequences of his actions and not hide behind others. Superintendent Hawkins arrived, instructing to round up everyone involved. Duff freed Ashby and urged him to follow orders to take Reade and Hazelton.

Crawling quietly, the two investigators approached unnoticed. They witnessed the late fighters getting into their cars as Hawkins directed the search for Reade and Hazelton. A surprising discovery in the gully amazed them - there were no dead or injured men left behind. It seemed the raiders had efficiently taken their wounded with them on horses, knowing paths inaccessible to cars. Rafe suggested going back to the trees to find the missing duo. Amidst the tension, Jeff silenced Duff's deceitful words with a threat. Harry and Tom, now freed from their restraints, were grateful for each other's quick thinking. Rafe fired shots as a signal, and soon an approaching car emerged from the darkness in response to the gunfire.|"['1.

Mr. Hawkins swiftly commanded the group to return to Paloma safely. He anticipated a jubilant reception upon receiving the good news. Tom's suspicions were confirmed as the raiders had sabotaged the telegraph wire. Mr. Hawkins, upon discovering this, raced back to camp on horseback. The men in Paloma despised Duff and his gang. The posse, hearing Ashby's gunshots from afar, circled around to approach the gully cautiously. Upon reaching Duff, who was apprehended, Dr. Furniss examined him and declared his condition grave. Duff, despite his predicament, harbored ill intentions towards Tom. Tom, in return, urged Duff to seek peace and hope for a better future.|"['1.

Tom declined, expressing no ill will towards Duff. Dr. Furniss nodded as men brought an old door to serve as a stretcher for the wounded gambler. Duff, shot in the lung, received immediate care on the sidewalk before being taken back to the Mansion House. Ashby, silent after the incident, was detained at the police station. Hawkins advised against honoring debts to gamblers, emphasizing the lack of integrity in their dealings. Duff passed away without remorse. Ashby was sent to an asylum and eventually discharged.
