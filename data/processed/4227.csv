Tom received a message today through a wire. It was from those aboard a yacht at St. Augustine, having a wonderful time. The owner, Mr. Hosbrook, was praised as an excellent host by Tom's mother. They were heading to the West Indies, and Tom hoped for their safe arrival, especially with the stormy season there. Tom confidently assured Miss Nestor that they would be fine, even joking that he would rescue them if they were stranded on a desert island. As Tom left Miss Nestor's company that night, he looked forward to visiting again and trying more dishes from the new cook once he fixed Mr. Fenwick's airship, BUTTERFLY. Tom cared deeply for BUTTERFLY, his lightweight and agile monoplane, more than his larger airship, RED CLOUD. As Tom approached his shed, he noticed movement inside and heard strange noises. Ready to confront the intruder, Tom hurried to the door, only to collide with the fleeing figure.|"['1.

Before Tom could even look at his own face, he saw Andy Foger under the faint light of the crescent moon. Tom recognized the town bully and was frustrated. Despite wanting to chase after Andy, Tom decided to check the damage first. The propeller of his beloved BUTTERFLY had been destroyed by Andy. Tom knew he had to focus on fixing Mr. Fenwick's airship first. He regretted not having the burglar alarm on, vowing to never let it happen again. Tom quickly reconnected the alarm, informed his father and the engineer, and they all agreed to be vigilant. Tom wished he had time to repair his monoplane before leaving for the WHIZZER trial, but his priorities lay elsewhere.|"['1.

Tom Swift, the young inventor, discussed his plans with his father. Tom mentioned flying the WHIZZER for a long journey and possibly visiting his dad. However, he also noted that if the aircraft needed more modifications, he couldn't predict when he would return. Tom assured his father that he would keep him updated through letters. Tom had recently equipped his aircraft, the RED CLOUD, with a wireless apparatus, allowing him to send and receive messages during flights. The wireless system used the frame's wires for transmission and had trailers for reception. Tom, along with Mr. Damon, arrived in Philadelphia to work on the airship. Mr. Fenwick suggested a long flight if the WHIZZER performed well, as the aircraft was provisioned for such journeys. The airship was tested in the yard with only a few individuals present.|"['1.

Tom, Mr. Damon, and Mr. Fenwick boarded the airship, suspended beneath the gas bag with wing-like planes on each side. Tom's plan was to make the WHIZZER rise by moving her across the ground on bicycle wheels and then using the tilting planes to lift her into the air without relying on the gas bag. As the motor started and the propellers spun faster, the airship was secured by a rope attached to a spring balance to measure the engine's power. With a cheer from spectators, the WHIZZER sped across the ground. Tom, closely monitoring the instruments, increased the engine speed and raised the elevating plane to lift the craft. After clearing a fence, the airship soared into the sky. Tom adjusted controls, remarking on the successful flight without using the gas bag, while Mr. Fenwick marveled at the experience. The airship circled at a height of two hundred feet before rising to nearly five thousand feet after filling the gas bag, proving its capability beyond expectations.|"['Question 1: How did Tom plan to make the WHIZZER rise into the air?\nA) By inflating the gas bag\nB) By using the propellers\nC) By moving her across the ground on bicycle wheels and then using the tilting planes\nD) By releasing the rope attached to the spring balance\nE) By increasing the engine speed without any other action', ""Question 2: What was attached to a spring balance to measure the engine's power?\nA) Gas bag\nB) Propellers\nC) Elevating plane\nD) Rope\nE) Airship"", 'Question 3: How did spectators react when the WHIZZER sped across the ground?\nA) They booed\nB) They remained silent\nC) They cheered\nD) They left the scene\nE) They shouted in fear', 'Question 4: What did Tom do after clearing a fence during the flight?\nA) Increased the engine speed\nB) Deflated the gas bag\nC) Released the rope\nD) Landed the airship\nE) Reduced the engine speed', 'Question 5: How did Mr. Fenwick feel about the experience of flying in the airship?\nA) Annoyed\nB) Disappointed\nC) Frightened\nD) Amazed\nE) Bored', 'Question 6: What did the airship do after circling at a height of two hundred feet?\nA) Landed\nB) Increased engine speed\nC) Rose to nearly five thousand feet after filling the gas bag\nD) Decreased in altitude\nE) Stopped moving']"|['C) By moving her across the ground on bicycle wheels and then using the tilting planes', 'D) Rope', 'C) They cheered', 'A) Increased the engine speed', 'D) Amazed', 'C) Rose to nearly five thousand feet after filling the gas bag']

Tom and his companions continued their journey in the airship, the WHIZZER, towards Cape May, a resort on the Jersey coast. As they approached their destination, Tom noticed the strengthening wind that would be against them on their return journey. Mr. Fenwick suggested descending to drop a message to a friend's house using a tube on the airship. Tom maneuvered the craft to fly low over the friend's residence, allowing Mr. Fenwick to send the message. However, as they tried to turn back towards Philadelphia, they encountered a strong headwind that turned into a near-hurricane force. Realizing the danger, Tom decided to fly with the wind's force, reaching speeds of up to seventy miles per hour.

"""The concept is quite straightforward,"" explained the young innovator. ""In telegraphy, a message is transmitted through wires using a battery or dynamo to create a current. This current is then interrupted by a 'key,' producing clicks on a sounding instrument. Dots and dashes represent letters, spelled out by different combinations. For wireless telegraphy, the air acts as a conductor with the earth's assistance. Messages are sent by generating a current with a dynamo, which then travels through the air until reaching receiving wires. The receiver decodes the clicks into letters, words, and sentences. By sending out distress signals like 'C.Q.D.' and our location, we hope for rescue.
