Tom Swift had a unique plan to find the treasure ship Pandora using a special cigar-shaped craft. This vessel, named the M. N. 1, was rebuilt and refitted with advanced features. Tom intended to use a diving bell to retrieve the treasure from the sunken ship's depths. The diving bell, inspired by his father's idea, allowed for deeper exploration underwater. Tom explained the concept using a glass tumbler in water to illustrate how the diving bell worked. With the deadline approaching to reach the West Indies before fall storms, Tom and his team worked tirelessly to prepare for the expedition, ensuring they could locate the sunken wreck before conditions became unfavorable.|"['1.

"Due to strong undersea currents, wrecks can be carried away and buried under sand, making it nearly impossible to recover them. In this case, time is of the essence. Ned quickly agreed to join his friend using the Air Scout aircraft. Tom explained that Mary had a minor car accident nearby and needed assistance. Tom planned to use his Air Scout to rescue her.

About a week prior, Tom and Ned traveled from Shopton to the dry dock where the submarine was being reconstructed in a small airship. Engine trouble arose after landing, leading them to return by car, leaving the Air Scout for repairs. Now, Tom planned to use it to rescue Mary. Hovering at a low altitude, Tom quickly reached the spot where Mary's car had broken down. Landing in a field, Tom noticed a crowd around Mary's stalled car. A young man driving another car admitted fault and offered to cover damages. Mary declined his offer to drive her, opting to return with Tom. After a brief inspection of Mary's car, Tom led her to the waiting airship. Mary expressed gratitude for the aerial rescue, mentioning family financial concerns but reassuring Tom it was not their own.|"['1.

Tom Swift and his friend Ned were flying back home in Tom's Air Scout after bidding farewell to Mary and her mother. Tom was deep in thought about Dixwell Hardley, whom he didn't trust. Despite his reservations, Tom was determined to continue with their plans to find a treasure ship. Tom wished he could locate the ship, give Hardley his share, and return to his work. He envisioned creating an airship as easy to use as a car. After dropping off Ned, Tom discussed the treasure-hunting trip with Mr. Damon and Hardley. They were eager to start the adventure. Tom was concerned about keeping the gold they found, but Hardley assured him they could claim it legally. Tom was skeptical of Hardley's intentions and disliked him more as time passed. Busy days followed as Tom rushed to complete the submarine for the treasure hunt. Mary christened the submarine the M.

Tom Swift, the young inventor, wanted to ensure that everything on the submarine was in order before venturing out for a test dive. He planned to try the new diving outfit and invited Ned and Koku to join. The special diving suits were prepared, with a giant-sized suit made for Koku. The suits were equipped with compressed air tanks and reinforced steel sheets to withstand the water pressure at great depths. The divers would have the freedom to explore the ocean floor without being tethered to the submarine. Once ready, Ned and Koku entered a steel chamber in the submarine, and as the water rushed in to equalize pressure, they prepared to step outside for their underwater adventure. Tom watched as the divers, illuminated by portable lights, moved gracefully through the Atlantic waters.|"[""1.

Ned and the large man moved slowly under the immense pressure, waving towards the submarine. They were testing a new diving suit successfully. Ned pretended to search for treasure and found a strange turtle. Koku kept watch for unusual sea creatures. Suddenly, the submarine shook, though it was still. Mr. Hardley was upset, questioning the safety of the submarine. Tom rushed to pump the water out of the chamber. Once clear, Ned and Koku stepped inside the craft. They decided to surface to avoid the whales. Tom believed moving would prevent further collisions.|"['1.

Tom and his companions hurried to the observation chamber and turned on the bright lights. In the green water, two huge bow-head whales appeared, puzzled by the lights. The whales approached the submarine, but the motion, lights, and steel skin made them uneasy. Tom mentioned they had guns and torpedoes for protection. Fortunately, the whales swam away, and the group reached the calm sea surface safely. Tom was determined to fulfill their mission and ensure everyone followed orders.

Tom, with a grin, considered trying something new in the future. However, at the moment, he had a different task at hand. Turning to Ned, he proposed another attempt at using the diving suit with a fresh air tank. Eager, Ned agreed to the challenge. Soon, he and a sailor ventured outside the submarine in the diving gear, while Tom and the rest observed from the glass windows. The new air tank appeared to be functioning smoothly, as Ned signaled his comfort from outside. As they explored, collecting coral samples, a sudden danger arose. A strange creature approached Ned, causing alarm among the onlookers. Tom swiftly took charge, assuring his crew of their duties.

Ned's friend, armed with a pole and knife, was trying to free him from a massive starfish that had trapped him underwater. Despite his efforts, the creature's grip remained strong, and Ned struggled to break free. As the sailor fought the sea beast, Tom and Koku arrived to help. Tom carried an electric rifle, and Koku had an axe. The sailor, Norton, was so focused on battling the giant starfish that he didn't notice Tom and Koku approaching. The creature, mistaken Ned for prey, had enveloped him in its arms, resembling a sack with segments opening and closing over him. The starfish's thousands of little feelers created a powerful suction, making it challenging for Ned to escape.|"['1.

Tom and his companions were in a perilous situation as a gigantic starfish enveloped Ned underwater. Tom, equipped with a new electric gun, fired a powerful electric charge at the starfish, aiming to stun or kill it. With Koku wielding an axe and Norton with a lance, they joined forces to attack the creature. After a tense moment, the starfish began to loosen its grip on Ned as the electric current took effect. With a swift stroke, Koku severed one of the starfish's arms, while Norton thrust his lance deep into its body, ensuring its demise. The team successfully freed Ned, and as the creature floated away, a school of fish swiftly devoured it.

Tom and his companions spent the day cruising in the open sea, recharging their batteries and preparing for their search for the Pandora, which Tom estimated would take some time. Finding the sunken ship in the deep sea wouldn't be easy. Ned and Mr. Damon fished while on the surface, providing a welcome change from their usual food. Thanks to Tom's refrigerating plant, they had fresh meat along with tinned and preserved foods. After consulting charts and calculating their progress, Tom predicted they would reach the Pandora's location in a day or two. To avoid navigating in darkness, they submerged the craft at night, resting on the seabed. The next morning, they ascended towards the Pandora's location.

Tom Swift and his companions found themselves in a tricky situation as their undersea craft got entangled in serpent weed. Despite the alarm on Ned and Mr. Damon's faces, Tom remained calm and suggested a solution. They decided to put on diving suits and go outside to chop away the weed from the craft's propellers. Tom took the lead and, along with Ned and Koku, ventured into the ocean. Equipped with diving gear and powerful lights, they carefully navigated the underwater world, surrounded by curious fish. Despite a failed attempt to reverse the propellers from inside the craft, Tom remained determined to free their vessel.

Tom and Ned were exploring the ocean floor in special suits invented by Tom, walking among beautiful coral formations and vibrant sea life. They were on a mission to free the propellers of their craft and locate the wreck of the Pandora. As they worked to clear the propellers entangled with serpent weed, Ned noticed a menacing shadow above. It was a devil fish, a member of the stingray family known for its horn-tipped tail used for defense and hunting. These creatures, with wing-like fins and powerful tails, can grow up to fifteen feet wide and are capable of creating a suction current to catch their prey. Ned, Tom, and Koku were faced with a dangerous encounter as they realized the threat posed by the devil fish in the depths of the ocean.|"['1.

"""Be still, and they'll swim away,"" Tom advised Ned and Koku via the telephone. The trio was observing devil fish near their boat, curious about the new presence. Unfortunately, Koku acted rashly, provoking one of the devil fish. The sea turned red as the wounded creature retaliated. The devil fish, equipped with poisonous and sharp tails, attacked the divers. Despite the danger, the well-made steel-lined suits protected them. Tom and his team fought back, landing blows on the devil fish. With careful jabs and strikes, they managed to fend off the creatures. Koku even severed the tail of the beast attacking him, ending the intense battle.

As the devil fish swam away wounded, Koku and Ned focused on Tom's foe, also injuring it until it sank. Exhausted, the divers saw the biggest creature, now harmless, carried away by the sea. Koku untangled his shaft first, followed by the others. Days later, they spotted a sunken steamer with massive torpedo holes.

"Tom suggested, ""Let's check the other side,"" and they moved to the back of the boat. When they reached a spot where the name was visible, Tom used his electric torch and they all read ""Blakesly, New York"" painted on it. Ned exclaimed, ""That's the ship that vanished mysteriously! I recall reading about it. It sailed from New York to Brest but never arrived. Finally, we've solved the mystery!"" Ned continued, ""None of the crew or passengers were ever found. It was thought a German sub attacked it, sinking it without a trace or taking survivors to Germany."" Tom said, ""Let's investigate further,"" and they entered through a smaller hole on the other side. Inside, they saw the destroyed engine room and disrupted boilers. Koku pointed to ropes used by those escaping the sinking ship. Tom, Ned, and Koku climbed up using a chain. On the deck, they found the captain's cabin, now empty and damaged by the sea."|"['1.

Using the iron bars they had, they pried open some lockers, finding only pulp inside. It was risky to explore further, so Tom's group left without uncovering the Blakesly's secret. Back home, Tom and Ned shared what they saw, revealing the ship held no treasure. They were relieved not to have risked their lives. While the submarine floated on the calm sea, the crew washed clothes on deck. Tom planned to stay on the surface all day for repairs and recharging. The search for the Pandora was paused, but not abandoned entirely. Tom mentioned a new theory would be developed. They threw cork pieces into the water to study the currents for clues. Mr. Damon was surprised by their method, thinking it was a game, but Tom explained their reasoning behind it.|"['1.

"""No, we'll have to use something heavier than cork,"" Tom said. ""We'll probably use weights and see how far they move along the bottom in a given time. But we have established one thing, and I begin to have hopes now that we may locate the Pandora.""

As evening approached, the submarine's lookout on deck informed Tom discreetly, ""Not exactly. But she might want to start a search on her own account, and there's no use of giving our presence away, or letting them guess at what might be right conclusions as to the location of the Pandora.""

""I shouldn't be a bit surprised. Anyhow, it's just as easy for us to submerge and let them do their own guessing. I was going down soon, anyhow, and another hour won't make any difference. Here, take a look, if you like.""

The M.N.1 submerged quickly, resting on the sea bottom. Tom planned experiments to determine how far weighted objects drifted, aiding in estimating the Pandora's location. The night passed calmly, and in the morning, calculations were made to deduce the Pandora's size and weight based on the drift distances of the objects."|"['1.

The depth gauge displayed over a thousand feet below as the M. N. 1 settled. Tom was surprised by the depth but his craft could handle the pressure. After a quick check, they began the search. The craft moved in wider circles underwater. They didn't find the treasure ship on the first day, but Tom had not promised immediate success. Ned suggested redoing current experiments when a sudden collision threw them off their feet. The crew worked to assess the damage. Automatic devices detected leaks and started pumps to remove water. Tom suspected multiple sections may have been breached. They decided to inspect the damage wearing diving suits. Mr. Damon, though willing, was not allowed due to safety concerns.|"[""1.

After the close call with the collision, Tom and his friends found themselves walking on the sandy seabed outside the submarine. Surrounded by a variety of fish, some quite large, they seemed harmless as they swiftly swam away. Moving cautiously due to the water pressure, they circled the submarine's nose. In the searchlight's glow, they spotted a partially buried steamer with its name still visible. Tom decided to investigate further. They noticed a peculiar current beyond the wreck and realized it was caused by the meeting of two strong currents. Staying behind the wreck provided safety from the powerful current. Using chains and a ladder left by the crew, they boarded the steamer easily. The Pandora was accessible, and they explored the cabins, focusing on the captain's cabin and the purser's strong room in search of valuable items.|"['1.

Tom explained that many plots involve someone investing money to gain control of a country, often for what they believe is the country's benefit. However, in this case, someone made a substitution, leaving the patriots at a loss. Despite not finding what he expected, Tom considered the trip a valuable experience where he learned something new. Although he didn't need the money, he sympathized with Mr. Damon's investment with Hardley. As they prepared to store the recovered gold, divers from the Pandora returned with a small steel box. Tom suspected that Hardley had returned with a different ship to try and recover the gold. Looking out through the glass windows, they saw a grappling iron near the wreck, indicating Hardley's presence on a nearby steamer.

Tom spoke about the Pandora, drawing a parallel to the ancient story of Pandora's box. He mentioned that most of the treasures seemed to have disappeared, leaving only Hope behind. However, they found a box on the Pandora, and when they managed to open it with Koku's strength, they discovered bundles of papers inside. These papers turned out to be the missing documents related to an oil-well deal, proving that Barton Keith owned a significant share in a valuable property. Tom suspected that Hardley, who was after the papers, might have known about their presence on the ship. Despite the gold being missing, the discovery of the papers revealed a fortune, confirming Mary's uncle's wealth. Tom speculated that Hardley might have orchestrated the search for the papers to claim them as his own. Ultimately, the M.
