A rainy winter day can be delightful indoors. The perfect pastime is reading a travel book, transporting you far from the gloomy weather outside. Imagination thrives, painting vivid scenes described in the book. Walls disappear, replaced by exotic landscapes and characters. Even in a small room, the vast Arabian desert or towering Central Asian mountains come alive. The magic of words conjures bustling bazaars and distant lands. Yet, as night falls, reality beckons. Venturing out, the rain's drumming on the umbrella contrasts with the cozy home. Despite initial reluctance, stepping into the wet darkness unveils a world waiting to be explored. The adventure begins, overcoming fears and uncertainties, to embrace the unknown beyond the cozy confines of home.|"['1.

I walk through the town center on solid paths, brightly lit up like after a great victory. Rows of shops with low windows shine side to side, while the dark night above keeps the light from spreading. The wet sidewalks reflect a red glow. Raindrops sparkle like rubies. Spouts gush with fire. It's like a symbol of the false light people use to blind themselves in the moral world. It's a dreary scene. A retired sea-captain heads to the Marine Insurance Office. A man rushes in the storm to find a doctor. A child stands under a spout, rain his element. A young couple, one in dancing shoes, struggle in the rain, heading to a dance. They slip on ice but emerge hand in hand, wet but still in love.|['1.
