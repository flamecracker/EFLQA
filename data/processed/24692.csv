Pa-pa was about to go out, holding his hat, but he sat down to listen to Kate. He promised to take them out in half an hour. Kate hurried upstairs to ask nurse for her wraps. When the horses were ready, Kate gleefully joined the outing. The afternoon was bright after the rain, making the grass and leaves look fresh and green. Ships sailed at sea like white birds. Kate's home was by the seaside, and their drive would lead them to the beach. The waves were wild due to the heavy surf. Passing a fishing village, they saw houses with fishing boats drawn up on the beach. A man worked on one boat, while a boy in another boat smiled at Kate. They passed a girl making lace and a boy carving a boat. They stopped by the cliffs to watch the sea waves and took a short run on the sands. Afterward, they continued their journey down a green lane where they met a girl and boy returning from school.|['1.

As the raindrops began to fall, Kate and her family stayed dry in their carriage with rugs. Kate noticed a girl and a boy seeking shelter under a bush. Concerned about getting home for Kate's supper and bedtime, she pointed out a girl heading to milk the cows. Passing a house, Kate spotted the children near a hogshead and assumed they were playing with chips. Suddenly, a dog chased by an angry cat caught their attention. Later, they saw a dog eyeing a baby's meal. Nearby, birds fed their young in an old cart filled with hay. Ready to head home, Kate's father took a different route, and they arrived just as the clock struck six.|"['1.
