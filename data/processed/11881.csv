"The young captain gazed at Robert, his eyes filled with disbelief. Soldiers nearby heard the warning, but it did not register with them.

Robert, forgetting his hunger, observed the dawn breaking in the east, turning the sky from gray to silver, then red and gold.

It was close to noon, and a large golden sun beamed over the vast wilderness where two small groups of men battled, barely visible in the expansive sea of green. Robert ate some venison and drank water from a soldier's canteen. His thoughts drifted to Tayoga, a remarkable runner who had been gone for a while. Would he return safely from investigating the smoke? The afternoon passed with sharpshooters on both sides attempting to stalk each other. Although Robert wasn't involved, the intense game intrigued and repelled him. Despite the skirmishes yielding no clear outcomes, the tension mounted as the day progressed. Hope swelled in Robert's heart, anticipating Tayoga's return with reinforcements. As the sun dipped low, anxiety gripped the men, awaiting help before nightfall. The sky hinted at signals of hope, possibly heralding Tayoga's return.|"['1. What did Robert eat during the battle?\nA) Bread\nB) Venison\nC) Fish\nD) Cheese\nE) Apples', ""2.

The gray mist in the east darkened as the sun set in the west, fading the colorful terraces. The firing stopped, and a tense silence fell. Hunter Colden gathered his troops near a cliff, all on high alert despite fatigue. Robert, instead of watching the east where St. Luc's forces were, focused on the sunset where Tayoga had gone, expecting a signal. As darkness enveloped the forest, a burst of firing from the south and war cries erupted. Tayoga and Mohawk chief Daganoweda arrived with their warriors, joining the battle against St. Luc's forces. Robert praised Daganoweda's courage and loyalty, explaining their timely arrival. The soldiers, initially alarmed, were reassured that the Mohawks were allies. The battle intensified with fierce fighting and war cries echoing through the forest.|"[""1.

Robert and his companions, along with the Mohawks, observed the soldiers fighting effectively from cover. The young Philadelphians, caught up in the battle's intensity and sudden turn of luck, risked exposing themselves recklessly. The advice from the experienced forest warriors proved invaluable. Despite losing two more men and having several wounded, Captain Colden could see the tide turning in their favor. The Mohawks' strategic intervention was decisive, forcing St. Luc's forces northward. Robert felt a surge of triumph, knowing the defeat would be bitter for St. Luc. As the Frenchmen began to retreat, Black Rifle noted their flight, and the pursuing force, fueled by victory, pressed on. Willet trusted Daganoweda and the Mohawks to safeguard them against any surprises, urging the group to strike with full force. Robert, caught up in the excitement, fired at fleeting figures, his imagination heightened by the chaos of battle. In a tense moment, he confronted St. Luc at close range, only to witness the Frenchman spare him and vanish into the darkness.|"[""1.

The battle had ended, leaving behind scattered flames and distant shouts of victory. Robert, saved by St. Luc's sudden change of heart, felt grateful. Despite the danger, he kept the encounter to himself. Grateful for the Mohawks' bravery, he mentioned the honorable French foe, St. Luc. Tayoga, exhausted but relentless, had pursued the fleeing enemy. Willet praised Captain Colden and his men for their valor in the fight. Returning to their defended ground, they lit a large fire, bringing comfort to the weary city lads. The victorious atmosphere dispelled any fear of St. Luc's return, as the Mohawks stood guard. The crackling fire symbolized their triumph, and the group basked in the warmth, reflecting on their hard-fought victory.|"['1.

The soldiers worked tirelessly, even in the dead of night, to bury their fallen comrades in shallow graves. Captain Colden, with his eloquent words, paid tribute to the deceased, ensuring their resting place was secure from scavengers. The wounded were cared for, a fire lit for warmth and comfort. Tayoga located a nearby spring for fresh water, ensuring their survival. As the soldiers settled down to rest, Black Rifle, a mysterious figure, joined them silently. The Mohawks, led by Daganoweda, returned, their loyalty and bravery evident. Robert's words of gratitude in Mohawk resonated deeply with them. Meanwhile, Willet reflected on the strange yet profound bond forged in the wilderness, where life and death intertwined. As dawn broke, he pondered the contrast between his past life and the present, where true friendship and sacrifice defined his existence.|"['1.

At daybreak, light flooded the land, rousing Daganoweda and the Mohawk warriors. The exhausted Philadelphia captain and his men remained in deep slumber. Tayoga, having exerted himself greatly, continued to rest, while Robert lay still by the coals. Daganoweda, a young chief of Mohawk courage, stirred awake. He observed his warriors with pride, embodying bravery and resourcefulness. Unlike Tayoga, he lacked spiritual depth, focused solely on warfare. Daganoweda, from the Turtle Clan of Ganeagaono, part of the Hodenosaunee League, felt immense satisfaction at their recent success. The warriors cooked a hearty breakfast of venison, hominy, bear meat, and beans. Daganoweda and Willet shared a meal, while Black Rifle sat alone, respected for his solitude and revered for his warrior prowess. Daganoweda silently thanked the sun, revered by the Mohawks, for their victory and prayed for future triumphs.|['1.

As they returned to the fire for their meal, they heard a rhythmic song and the steady thud of feet. Some Mohawks performed the Buffalo Dance, a tribute to their bravery and energy while hunting buffalo with the Cherokees. The dance, called Dageyagooanno, involved drumming and rattling, with warriors leaping and bending like buffaloes. Robert, intrigued, watched as they danced and sang about war and victory. After a long night's rest, Captain Colden discussed plans to build a fort in the west to defend the border. Despite injuries, the troop resumed their journey, with Daganoweda departing for a raid. He bid farewell to Robert, Tayoga, Willet, and Black Rifle, acknowledging their warrior spirit and foreseeing future alliances in the ongoing conflict.|"['1.

Lieutenant Wilton, maintaining his manners despite the circumstances, expressed his gratitude for the improved vigilance now that Colden and his troop had joined forces. The camp was filled with joy at their unity. Wilton's confidence had shifted to extreme distrust, seeing danger lurking in every shadow. The group was uplifted by the skilled care provided by Willet and Black Rifle for the wounded, expecting quick recoveries. Amid high spirits, discussions ranged from Philadelphia to Quebec, with a mix of fashion and war. Wilton reflected on his sudden urge for battle, attributing it to generations of repressed belligerency. Colden reassured him, emphasizing the importance of vigilance after their recent ordeal.

Great Britain and the Colonies had not yet started to act. The Provincial legislatures were still arguing, and the London government was frustratingly slow. There was no solid plan yet, and the Anglo-Saxons' vast resources were not yet united against the agile French. Willet anticipated a prolonged and dreadful war with initial setbacks. He felt downcast, foreseeing the impact of early French victories on the Indian tribes. He also realized that there would be no English campaign that year due to the challenging North American wilderness. Despite this, he decided to leave, knowing the company was in good spirits. The wounded were placed on pack horses, and the rest marched ahead energetically. Robert, Tayoga, and the Philadelphians formed a strong bond during the journey.

The young officers chatted cheerfully as the troop marched vigilantly. Willet, Tayoga, and Colden ensured the group's safety. Robert, Tayoga, and Willet scouted the flanks, with soldiers assisting. Despite no further Indian trace, the guard remained alert. Robert found the march exciting, his imagination magnifying the forests and rivers. His friendships with the Philadelphians deepened, forming a lasting bond. As the heat intensified, they encountered a fierce storm. The men, drenched but undeterred, dried off quickly under the sun's warmth. The next day, they discovered an Indian trail, but Willet and Tayoga deduced it was a small group heading north.|"[""1.

Wilton, a keen observer, predicted that the fort they were building in the woods would attract attention. He anticipated that Indian messengers would spread the news, drawing them like bees to honey. Two days later, they arrived at the chosen site, naming it Fort Refuge to offer shelter to settlers in need. The location, near a creek with a nearby spring, promised a secure water source during any siege. The task of constructing the fort was daunting, but the young soldiers, led by Colden, Wilton, and Carson, persevered. They toiled to erect a log blockhouse and a sturdy palisade, ensuring the safety of their horses and supplies. Despite the challenging work, the soldiers found purpose and unity in their shared mission. Colden envisioned adding a cannon to the fort, bolstering their defenses.

"""Many underestimate the strength of the Native Americans,"" Robert remarked. ""But in this war, we'll witness their power. If the Hodenosaunee turned against us, we'd be defeated by now."" Robert continued to praise Tayoga, a swift and agile member of the Onondaga nation. Tayoga's speed and stealth were unmatched, enabling him to navigate dangerous paths undetected.

Robert smiled confidently, envisioning his friend Tayoga with remarkable clarity. He described Tayoga's tall, sturdy frame, his keen eyes that pierced through darkness, and his tireless stride. Despite the icy rain, Robert's faith in Tayoga's abilities remained unwavering. As the sentinels patrolled the palisade, Robert acknowledged their concern for Tayoga's journey into the storm. He reassured them of Tayoga's unmatched wilderness skills. Later, when hail began to fall, Robert retreated indoors, joining his comrades in sleep. The next morning, as the hail persisted, Wilton expressed worry for Tayoga's safety. Robert, however, remained steadfast in his belief in Tayoga's resilience. The fort, though not as comfortable as Philadelphia, provided essential shelter. Under Captain Colden's guidance, the men thrived, honing their hunting skills and preparing for the challenges ahead. Despite the harsh conditions, the fort became a place of growth and resilience for all its inhabitants.|"['1.

The snow fell for a whole day and night, creating a beautiful yet inaccessible wilderness. Wilton and Robert discussed visions of the future. Wilton doubted the mystical abilities of the Highland Scotch and Indians. Robert was confident in his vision of Tayoga using a hidden canoe. The warm rain caused flooding, forcing Tayoga to adapt. The sudden cold turned everything to ice, halting hunting. The men sought shelter in the fort as temperatures plummeted. The next morning dawned clear and frigid, with the world transformed into a glittering winter wonderland. The creek froze over, and the landscape sparkled in the cold. Despite the challenges, the fort dwellers found warmth and comfort by the fireside.|['1.

Tayoga, a skilled observer of nature, saw the freeze coming. He carefully hid his canoe on land among thick bushes to protect it from the ice. To move swiftly over the frozen ground, he used heavy moose skin moccasins with the hair outside, ensuring a secure grip. Despite the harsh cold lasting two days, Willet's preparation with abundant fuel kept them warm. A sudden thaw followed by a fierce winter hurricane tested their resilience. Tayoga, now far from the Onondaga vale, sought shelter in a rocky crevice, enjoying the storm's primal power from his safe hideout. His adaptability and foresight ensured his comfort and safety amidst nature's fury.|"['1.

In all honesty, Lennox can indeed do it, Will. He lies on a stone shelf with a stone ledge above him. His blanket softens the hardness of the stone beneath him. He watches branches and twigs swept away by the storm, yet none reach him. The wind howls and shrieks at a pitch that might scare someone unfamiliar with the woods, but to Tayoga, it's just a melody. It calms him, it lulls him, and knowing he can't travel during the storm, he uses it to rest, allowing him to travel less later when the storm ends. In the end, he loses nothing for his journey. Now, his eyelids droop, his eyes shut, and he sleeps while the storm rages on, unable to harm him.|['1.

In the wintry wilderness, a group of city men, young soldiers, faced a strange and threatening situation. Surrounded by a black forest, they awaited an attack from a hidden enemy.

During the night, the fort was under attack with burning arrows raining down, but the defenders managed to put out the flames. In a fierce battle, the garrison repelled a charge of warriors who vanished into the darkness. Despite sporadic attacks, the defenders held their ground. The next day, with the sun shining brightly, the spirits of the defenders were uplifted. The siege continued, but the defenders felt confident in their stronghold. However, worries lingered about Tayoga, who was missing. Later, a sharpshooter was neutralized, and a white flag was seen among the trees, leading to a meeting with French officers. Robert, despite their past treachery, did not harbor hatred towards them. Captain Colden sought the advice of Robert and the hunter, Mr. Willet, during the negotiations.

Colonel Auguste de Courcelles, a French officer, and Captain Francois de Jumonville are leading a French and Indian force laying siege to a fort defended by Captain Colden. The French demand the surrender of the fort, but Colden, standing confidently before the gate, refuses.

Robert chuckled, teasing Will for lacking humility. He hinted that Will's jest about his ancestry's valor might hold some truth. Robert anticipated seeing Will's bravery in battle. Will, however, attributed any valor to fate, not himself. They discussed the French officers and their allies' next moves after a challenge. The night was bright with stars, and the forest glowed. The French and their allies set fires around Fort Refuge, tightening their watch. Despite Robert's confidence, Will doubted Tayoga's chances of reaching them. The next day dawned beautifully, with the Indian fires still burning. Will saw no way for Tayoga to break through the encirclement.

The winter day was cold but dazzling, with a vivid sun rising in the sky. Robert spotted De Courcelles and Jumonville about six hundred yards away by a fire, joined by the gigantic figure of Tandakora, painted with hideous designs. Despite the cold, the Ojibway warrior seemed fierce, his size exaggerated by the flames. Robert knew they must be wary of Tandakora's hate for them. The besiegers appeared lazy but vigilant, ensuring no intruders passed unnoticed. The Indians shot arrows and shouted, but it went unanswered. Willet predicted more tribes would join the siege.

The young man from Philadelphia felt his heart sink as noon approached, the appointed time. The sky was bright with no clouds to hide anyone. Wilton, his comrade, noticed a glint in his eyes, not of despair, but triumph. Had Robert seen a sign? Scanning the forest, Wilton saw the French, Indians, and runners near the fires. Suddenly, Robert gasped, his eyes fixed on De Courcelles and the Indian. The runner swiftly knocked De Courcelles out and dashed towards the fort. Willet ordered the gate open, and Tayoga, disguised as a Micmac, rushed in. Tayoga explained his clever plan to deceive Tandakora and gain entry.

In the forest, angry yells rose as Jumonville and two French soldiers tended to the injured De Courcelles. Inside the fort, Tayoga's arrival was met with admiration. He washed off his Micmac paint, revealing his true identity, and then ate and drank. Wilton apologized for underestimating Tayoga's abilities, impressed by the Onondaga's actions. Tayoga shared news from the vale of Onondaga, where the French were active, gaining support from western tribes. The British colonies were slower to act but had greater strength. Franklin was preparing a movement against Fort Duquesne, and an English force was on its way. The Mohawks supported the English, maintaining a friendly stance.

The attackers made no moves, but defiantly increased the fires around the fort. Robert noticed De Courcelles with a bandaged head, seething with anger. The weather turned bitterly cold, and the forest tepees multiplied, indicating a long siege. The blockhouse creaked in the intense cold. Willet foresaw the need to cut grass for the horses.

"Their camp, too, shows increasing signs of permanency. They've built a dozen bark huts in which all the French, all the chiefs and some of the warriors sleep, and there are skin lodges for the rest. Oh, it's quite a village! And they've accumulated game, too, for a long time. ""We're not fulfilling our mission,"" he said.

After a long and captivating day, they returned to Mr. Hardy's house. Grosvenor soon joined them, and after a hearty supper, they all went to the play. Dressed in their finest attire, even young Master Jonathan had his hair powdered and tied back neatly. Mr. Hardy admired his appearance. Jonathan smiled proudly. Among them, Tayoga stood out the most, towering above the rest in his traditional Native American attire. As they walked towards the theater on Nassau Street, they crossed paths with Governor de Lancey and other prominent figures, all showing respect. Edward Charteris, a stylish young man soon to join the Royal Americans, joined their group.

Robert was very interested in the conversation. Charteris had a wealth of knowledge and added his own unique touch to it. He not only knew about the people but also their personal quirks, rivalries, and jealousies. Robert learned that New York was bustling not just commercially but socially too. Family held great importance, and the wealthy landowners who had received vast grants along the Hudson still had feudal rights, exuding pride like noble families in Europe. Class distinctions were strong, with English fashion setting the trend. As they settled down, the display of luxurious clothing and jewelry was remarkable, catching the eye of many British officers. The group Robert was with, led by Master Benjamin Hardy, drew attention. They were a diverse and impressive group, including Edward Charteris, a model of manners, a tall youth, a dignified Indian chief, and the formidable Willet. The gathering was extraordinary, causing whispers of admiration, especially for Robert and Tayoga. Mr. Hardy was pleased by the attention, noting the unique qualities of his companions, including Colonel Brandon and Major Apthorpe. The audience was now ready for the play, promising a splendid and diverse spectacle comparable to the grand theaters in London.|['1.

Robert felt a secret pleasure as he sat in the theater. Even though he was more connected to Albany than New York, he still felt a sense of belonging to the city at the mouth of the Hudson River. The anticipation of the city's future greatness excited him. The play 'Richard III' was about to begin, and Robert was eager. As the curtain rose, he was transported into a world of romance and tragedy created by Shakespeare's powerful words. The actors, Hallam and his wife, held the audience captive with their skilled performances. Robert was completely absorbed in the play, forgetting everything around him. The influence of the tragedy on Tayoga, an Onondaga with a unique perspective, was as profound as on Robert. Tayoga felt a sense of pride in his heritage, believing that his people governed better than the English nobles. As the play unfolded, Robert noticed a man in the audience who bore a striking resemblance to himself, but dismissed it as unlikely.|"[""1.

Robert was initially convinced that the man sitting near the door was St. Luc, a romantic and adventurous figure. He positioned himself between Tayoga and the man, trying to shield St. Luc from recognition. However, as the play progressed, Robert's attention shifted back to the performance, and he momentarily forgot about St. Luc. When the second act ended and he looked back, the man he thought was St. Luc had vanished, replaced by a stout Dutchman. Robert felt relieved, realizing it must have been a trick of his imagination. As he mingled with notable figures during the intermission, he adapted seamlessly to the high society of New York. Despite the earlier confusion, he engaged with the crowd and even received invitations to prestigious events. Although he had hoped to confirm St. Luc's presence, he found no sign of him, accepting the situation and focusing on the play once more.|"['1.

Robert was about to offer his hand, but noticing that Mynheer Van Zoon did not reciprocate, he held back. The merchant's face turned a deeper shade of red than usual, his eyes avoiding contact. Robert found Van Zoon, who was a few years older and stouter than Hardy, unappealing. Mr. Hardy hinted at hidden motives, mentioning his special friends who had returned to civilization. As the play reached its climax, Robert was immersed in the drama, forgetting those around him. After the play, they observed the bustling street as carriages departed. Mr. Hardy, Willet, and Jonathan chuckled quietly, noticing Van Zoon's departure without acknowledging them. Robert left for the public library the next morning, admiring the city's progress. He explored the vast collection, particularly enjoying history and fiction. The New York Society Library impressed him, and he vowed to visit frequently if he became a permanent resident.|"[""1.

When Robert left the library around noon, the day was cloudy with flurries of snow, making the streets cold. He wrapped his heavy cloak tightly and walked towards the Battery to see the ships from around the world. A stranger, with his coat collar up, approached Robert. The man, a Frenchman, praised Shakespeare and the play they both watched the night before. Robert, intrigued by the stranger's journey, acknowledged the risks taken to see the play. The Frenchman admitted enduring a storm to reach New York for the love of Shakespeare. Robert noticed the humor in the Frenchman's eyes, feeling a connection to his adventurous spirit. They bonded over their shared appreciation for the play and discussed staying for more performances by Mr. Hallam's company during their stay in New York.|"['1.

They walked through the town, unnoticed by the passersby. The day grew darker as heavy clouds rolled in from the sea, casting a somber atmosphere over the solid buildings. Snowflakes started to fall, whipped by a sharp wind. People hunched forward, wrapping their cloaks tightly around them. In the midst of the storm, a man spoke softly to Robert, revealing his genuine intentions. As they trudged on through the snow, the man shared how those around him had shown kindness and protection. He warned Robert about Adrian Van Zoon, urging caution. With a heartfelt farewell, the man vanished into the blizzard.

Robert, a young man, was enchanted by the grandeur of New York City. Attending a lavish ball at the Walton mansion, he marveled at the opulence of the most elaborate home in North America. The mansion, reminiscent of an English country house, boasted imported woodwork and a staircase made of dark ebony that was a marvel of its time. Robert reveled in the company of the city's elite, feeling welcomed into their social circle through the sponsorship of Mr. Hardy.

He listened carefully, and he felt like the sounds of the ship's ropes were getting louder. At times, he thought he heard footsteps above, but he dismissed it as his mind playing tricks. Finally, the door opened, and two men entered the room with a lantern. Robert managed to turn and look at them. The shorter man with gold earrings seemed Portuguese, but Robert's focus shifted to the taller man behind him. This man, with his clean-shaven face and piercing blue eyes, appeared to be the ship's captain. Their laughter filled Robert with disgust, but he held back his anger.

Robert was assigned to help Miguel in the galley for a couple of days. The captain threatened him with a belaying pin if he didn't stay there. Robert suspected the captain's plan to endanger him by sending him to icy rigging. However, he realized the captain's fear of him being seen on deck near the land. Robert worked diligently in the galley, listening attentively to gather information. He noticed the fog and guessed they were near the coast, giving him hope for escape. Despite his humiliation, he served the captain well, planning to repay the debt later. Miguel complimented Robert's improvement, boosting his spirits for the challenging tasks ahead.|"[""1.

When all the work was finished, he climbed into a bunk just above the cook's and in another scenario, would have fallen asleep immediately. But his nerves were tense, and he wasn't tired at all. Miguel, without changing his clothes, lay in the bunk below him, and Robert soon heard him snoring. Above, new sounds emerged, a whistle, a shriek, and a roar combined that he didn't recognize at first, but a moment's thought revealed it to be a rising wind and the crashing waves. The ship began to sway violently. He felt dizzy for a moment, but quickly regained his composure. A storm! This realization brought him comfort. He couldn't explain why, but it also brought hope and opportunity. He sat up in his bunk, occasionally hearing voices and footsteps above, but they were soon drowned out by the howling wind and the constant roar of the waves crashing against the ship's side. It was indeed a fierce storm. He knew the ship, though stripped down, must be sailing fast, but he had no idea where they were headed. He would have given anything to know. The cook woke up groggily, then jumped up, a look of fear on his face. While the Portuguese man's eyes showed fear, he also appeared bewildered. It was clear to Robert that he was a deep sleeper; with his long black hair falling over his face, he looked around frantically. His appearance even brought a flicker of humor|"['1.

The strong, icy wind blew from the northeast, pushing the schooner dangerously fast. Despite the efforts of the skilled captain and crew, the ship struggled against the violent swells. Robert, looking westward, spotted land - a beacon of freedom. Even though the land may be treacherous, it was better than the horrors of the slaver's deck. As the storm raged on, Robert prepared for the worst. He armed himself with a greatcoat, pistols, and a small sword. When the crew launched the boats, disaster struck. Robert witnessed the loss of his crewmates and was left in charge of the ship by the captain.

A leveled pistol made him stop, then he slid down a rope into a boat. The sailors cut the rope, leaving Robert alone on the schooner. His exultation turned to despair momentarily, but his courage returned. He remembered Tayoga, who would pray to his Manitou, Robert's God, and trust in His wisdom. He felt relieved to be rid of the hateful crew. As he watched the slavers' ship disappear, he saw the second boat overturn, but felt no pity. The captain's boat vanished in the mist. Clinging to the mast's stump, he braced for impact as the breakers approached. He prayed for a miracle. The schooner miraculously navigated through a narrow opening in the breakers, grounding on a sandy beach. Robert, saved, gave thanks. Wet and cold, he ran for the land, surviving the waves.

Robert woke up on a desolate shore, feeling cold and wet but free. The slaver's ship had run aground, a victim of the storm. Despite the chill, Robert felt a thrill of joy. He ran to warm himself up, drying his clothes in the wind. With his pistols reloaded, he set out to explore the area. Realizing the need for sleep and food, he found a hidden spot among the bushes to rest. As the sun rose, he awoke feeling refreshed and hungry.

The calm sea gently swayed as Robert approached the schooner, partially buried in the sand. He saw it as a refuge filled with provisions. Walking down the beach, he stumbled upon the bodies of slavers washed ashore. Eager to leave the grim sight behind, he boarded the vessel. Despite the water damage, it held a bounty of food.

The brave sailor carefully outwitted the angry captain on the ship. With a steady hand, he held a pistol, forcing the captain and his men to raise their hands.

He was right in his belief, seeing them linger on the deck, likely searching for a glimpse of him among the bushes. After observing them for a bit, he headed inland, carrying his load of weapons and food, amused by how he had turned the tables on the captain. Feeling that justice was served, he was ready to part ways for good. Youth and success had a profound impact on him, fueling his optimism for more triumphs. While he felt momentarily content with his self-rescue, he knew his journey back to New York awaited.

He followed the stream for a long way until he reached a shallow area where he could cross on stones. His search for a dry crossing had caused a delay, but he found comfort in the large, round stones that resembled those he had seen back in New York. As the day turned into night and the cold set in, he prepared to spend another night in the wilderness. He gathered dead leaves to make a warm nest for himself, shielding against the cold earth and air. Despite the darkness, he found solace in the stars, especially the one he believed to be Tododaho, the Onondaga chieftain watching over him. The next morning, he resumed his journey and encountered the captain and two sailors. Despite the tension, he remained calm, knowing he had faced many dangers before.

In a society where slavery was common, there was a mix of grandeur and gaudiness. Carriages from London paraded the streets, accompanied by black coachmen. Young men rode horses with English elegance and skill. The parsons, like those in England, also rode and socialized with the best. This exclusive yet provincial society soon produced remarkable individuals, reminiscent of ancient Athens. Robert, Tayoga, and Grosvenor encountered a young man on a white horse, exuding strength and outdoor living. Despite offers to join the army, Robert chose to be a scout and skirmisher, valued for their keen eyes in the wilderness. The governor recognized their quality and granted them commissions. At a lively gathering at the Governor's Palace, with music and dancing, the Virginia gentry displayed their British mannerisms and devotion to personal independence. The atmosphere was jovial yet restrained, reflecting a cultivated society in close connection with Britain.|"['1.

Robert observed that the men, accustomed to outdoor living and nourishing meals, were consistently tall and sturdy. The women appeared robust with rosy complexions. His adaptable nature, which had allowed him to appreciate diverse places like New York and Quebec, also made him fond of Williamsburg, a place distinct from the others. Robert quickly felt at ease in this society, finding the hours too short for the festivities. Engaging in dancing with both young and elderly women, he earned approving glances from Willet. The atmosphere was lively with continuous music and dancing, lasting throughout the night and into the next day at grand houses. Amidst a late-night debate, Robert was approached by two young men, Walter and James, discussing the speed of their horses. Robert, fully immersed in Virginia's lifestyle, eagerly anticipated the upcoming race.|"['1.

He shared with them that the shadow to the north appeared dark and threatening. The French were described as an ambitious, courageous, and skilled people. They had earned the trust of the natives and now ruled the vast wilderness. Their actions were shrouded in mystery, making it unclear where or when they would strike. The driving force behind their actions stemmed from the proud and powerful court at Versailles with aspirations of universal control. It was crucial for Virginians and all colonists to unite against this looming threat. The members paid close attention, understanding the seriousness of the situation. Robert, who had encountered the French in battle, was well aware of their abilities and the menacing shadow in the north. However, his spirits lifted upon reuniting with his young friends in the vibrant sunshine. The Virginians were a unique mix of cheerfulness and seriousness, focusing momentarily on an upcoming horse race rather than the impending conflict. The excitement around the race brought more visitors to Williamsburg, with young men showcasing their horses and engaging in friendly competitions. The atmosphere was jovial, resembling a large family gathering. Grosvenor expressed interest in the race and sought advice on placing a bet. The following day, the race track was bustling with activity as people eagerly awaited the main event.

Robert was fixated on St. Luc, a man in poor circumstances but dressed like a gentleman, at the horse race. He pondered why St. Luc was in Williamsburg, suspecting he might be spying on the American preparations. Despite his admiration for St. Luc, Robert felt duty-bound to have him captured for the sake of his country. As the race began, the excitement grew, with spectators cheering for their favored horses. Stuart and Cabell, the jockeys, mounted their horses, ready to race around the mile-long track. The crowd erupted as the horses thundered past, neck and neck.

Robert comprehended the Virginians' passion for horse racing. Witnessing the test of strength and endurance of the horses and the skill of the riders was exhilarating. As the race progressed, the crowd's excitement grew. The lead shifted back and forth between the sorrel and the bay horse, leaving spectators on edge.

"""No! No, friends!"" exclaimed the Governor. ""Be satisfied! You have two excellent horses, the finest in Virginia, evenly matched. Besides, you rode them exceptionally well. Now, let them rest, sharing the honor that each deserves."" Stuart and Cabell, after their competitive spirit had cooled, agreed it was a good idea. They shook hands warmly, praising each other, and joined a group of friends at the tavern for punch. ""Even Todadaho, who sees the future, doesn't know which horse is better,"" remarked Tayoga. ""It's good. Some mysteries make life interesting."" Willet added, ""The unknown attracts us, and this race ended well. Instead of envy, they feel like brothers."" As they headed back to the tavern, Willet mentioned a council in Alexandria with General Braddock, suggesting they attend.

Robert, following Tayoga's lead, ate little and barely sipped the punch. As the night grew warm, he slipped out of the lively tavern in Williamsburg for some fresh air. In the moonlit darkness, the outline of the college and the Governor's Palace loomed. A cool sea breeze refreshed him as he strolled hat in hand. Suddenly, St. Luc emerged, hinting at Robert's hidden past and his suspicions. St. Luc challenged Robert's loyalty, but Robert, loyal to Virginia, prepared to confront him. Just as a sentinel approached, St. Luc vanished into the shadows. The guests spilled out of the tavern, confused by the commotion. Robert watched St. Luc evade capture, feeling relieved that he had upheld his duty.|"['1.

Robert was pleased to have the sentinel's account because the revelers mocked him for a false alarm, claiming the punch had made him see a French spy. The next day, he reported to Governor Dinwiddie about seeing St. Luc, a formidable French leader. At Alexandria, Braddock's camp was set for a crucial council with other governors. The council proposed a strategic campaign: Braddock would attack Fort Duquesne, Shirley would target Beauséjour, De Lancey would move on Crown Point and Niagara, and Acadia would be seized. The vision was to eliminate French power from North America. Colonel Johnson shared plans for a northern expedition and expressed the significance of the council's decisions.

Colonel Johnson, a towering figure among the Hodenosaunee nations, was granted full powers to negotiate with the tribes and lead the expedition against Crown Point. Despite delays, Johnson's eyes shone with anticipation after the council. Meanwhile, General Braddock's army faced supply issues due to a rift between Pennsylvania and Virginia. The Pennsylvanians, many being Quakers and Germans, clashed with Braddock over the army's landing at Alexandria instead of Philadelphia, causing a stalemate in supplying the troops. Contractors prioritized profits over patriotism, exacerbating the situation. Braddock, though valiant, struggled with the unfamiliar terrain and lack of discipline among the troops.

Robert heard that in these turbulent times, young Washington, who Braddock had appointed as a colonel, was proving to be an effective mediator between the irritable general and the stubborn locals. Despite his youth, Washington displayed remarkable character traits that would later define him during the Revolutionary War. Willet mentioned that General Braddock trusted Washington's judgment and honesty. Robert, amidst the uncertainties, found joy in his interactions with Virginians and British officers. He befriended Captain Robert Orme, Lieutenant Halket's son, and Morris, among others. Grosvenor, along with Tayoga, joined in the conversations by the campfires where tales of London's high life and royal gossip were shared. Willet highlighted Franklin's diplomatic success in resolving tensions with Pennsylvanians, ensuring the army's readiness to march from Wills Creek to establish Fort Cumberland and advance into the uncharted wilderness.|"['1.

Robert, Willet, and Tayoga decided to decline the offer of horses despite protests from their English friends. They believed they could scout better on foot along the army's flanks. Willet explained to Grosvenor that the forest felt like home to them, offering shelter and food. Grosvenor admired the wilderness's beauty and the adventure of exploring unknown lands with a grand army. The group was in the western part of Pennsylvania, claimed by both the English and the French. Trader Croghan brought Indian warriors to the camp, including some from the Hodenosaunee, offering their services. Willet trusted Colonel William Johnson to treat the Indians fairly. Robert and Tayoga discussed the impending battle to take Fort Duquesne, a key stronghold in the Ohio country. Later, a mysterious figure and his wild-looking companions approached General Braddock's tent, sparking curiosity among the soldiers.|"['1.

"""These are brave and skillful men,"" Willet remarked, impressed by the French leaders' names. ""It was kind of you, Black Rifle, to bring your men to assist us."" After a brief rest, they entered the large tent where the general sat. Robert, Grosvenor, and Tayoga stayed close, recognizing the value of Black Rifle's expertise in the wilderness. However, after a tense encounter with General Braddock, Black Rifle and his men abruptly left, feeling misunderstood and unappreciated. Willet expressed his disappointment, emphasizing the need for Black Rifle's help. Despite the army's departure into the wilderness, the loss of Black Rifle was deeply felt.

The army, filled with joy, marveled at the beauty of the wilderness during a splendid time of year. Robert, Willet, and Tayoga scouted ahead, ensuring the safety of the group as they explored the forest. The axmen, skilled and strong, cleared the way for the army, a sight that saddened Robert as majestic trees fell. Nights at camp were cheerful, with scouts on alert and fires providing warmth and light. Despite some falling ill, the army pressed on, leaving the sick behind to meet the French reinforcements at Fort Duquesne. Braddock, though irritable, trusted young Washington and others. Robert, Tayoga, and Willet scouted freely, noticing signs of enemy presence. As they followed a large trail, they spotted a distinct large moccasin print, hinting at danger ahead.|['1.

After a long march through the wilderness, the army finally arrived near Fort Duquesne. Scouts reported silence and desolation, indicating that victory was close. The soldiers rejoiced at the peaceful surroundings, with no signs of the enemy. Robert, Tayoga, and Willet ventured closer to the fort and observed small trails but no large forces. As they saw a light from Duquesne, Willet reminded Robert of the unpredictability of the wilderness and the bravery of the French commanders.
