At four o'clock in the afternoon and morning, the ship's bell rings eight times. It then repeats with one bell at half-past four, two bells at five, and so on. Betty and her friends set off on a boat, using an automatic gauge to check the fuel level. As they cruise down the stream, they enjoy the ride, taking turns steering and saluting passing boats. Discovering stowaways on board, Betty locks them in the cabin playfully. The stowaways, two boys looking for a joyride, admit their prank. Grace shares candy with one of the boys, and the group decides to let them stay and work their passage on the boat.|"[""1.

"Betty's boat was a beautiful sight, the envy of all the boys in Deepdale. Will and Frank eagerly stowed away for a chance to ride in it. Mollie mentioned, “He writes little verses as he waits on you. You'll see."" She also shared stories of a polite old man with quirky tales they often met while rowing. Mr. Lagg brushed off ghost stories, questioning the logic of clanking chains on a ghost. Despite the girls' nerves, Betty dismissed the talk of ghosts, focusing on a brass lantern for her boat. The girls, including Alice and Kittie, who had been forgiven for past actions, were getting ready for a trip to Rainbow Lake.

The boat, named the _Gem_, gently drifted along the river as Betty, the captain, reduced the engine's speed to hear farewell calls better. Mrs. Billette waved goodbye and hurried back home, leaving the maid with little Paul. Amy asked Betty for orders as the girls and Aunt Kate gathered on the deck. The girls, dressed in sailor suits, presented a picturesque sight as the _Gem_ sailed down the Argono River. Betty accelerated the boat's engine, creating foam at the stern. She planned a leisurely cruise, stopping for lunch and overnight stays. Amy took the wheel but nearly collided with a canoeist. The engine had a minor issue but was fixed by a passing boater. They discussed camping plans and enjoyed a sunset stroll before settling in for the night on the dock.|"['1.

Betty, a light sleeper, was the first to wake up. She felt a strange swinging motion, like being in a hammock. Realizing they were on a boat, Betty and Mollie hurried to the deck upon seeing a bright light approaching. They noticed the white light with red and green on the sides, indicating a ship. Betty took charge, signaling the other ship while trying to start their motor. They realized they forgot to turn on their side lamps for visibility. With a quick thinking, they turned on the electric lamps to signal their presence. The other ship couldn't change course due to shallow waters. They attempted to start their motor, but it didn't respond as expected.|"['1.

Betty skillfully maneuvered the _Gem_ as it sped past the river steamer. Almost colliding, they heard the pilot's concern. After a slight detour, they docked. Betty defended their near-miss, explaining the right of way. Mollie reassured her, blaming the mishap on motorists. As they prepared breakfast, Aunt Kate cooked while the girls chatted. The next morning, they reminisced about a past adventure. Grace then practiced sailor knots. After breakfast, they planned a stop in Dunkirk for supplies. Jokingly, they asked if anyone had seen their boat, the _Gem_, manned by four girls. It was a playful start to another day of nautical escapades.|"['1.

""Of course, I'll come! That's why I came here. I calculated your arrival and decided to join you. How was your journey?"" Betty's uncle responded warmly.

The girls were delighted to see him, and with supplies on board, the old sea captain took the wheel as they sailed down the river. At noon, they stopped for lunch and learned knot-tying from Mr. Marlin. Later, they made a call to check on little Dodo and the missing horse and papers.

"""I will send you a formal entry blank tomorrow,"" Mr. Stone said as his companion started the motor, and soon they were speeding off in a flurry of foam churned up by the powerful racing craft.

She laughed and looked around for help. ""Well, if we make some inquiries and find out that they are alright to talk to—and they may be despite the mean way they acted toward you—then we can question them and gradually steer the conversation towards cars, racing, storms, and all that.

Grace and Amy were in charge of the motor, well-prepared by Uncle Amos. They ensured it had oil and could fix any issues. Positioned in the cabin, they could access the machinery easily. Before the Class B race, all boats, including the _Gem_, were inspected. As the race began, the _Gem_ trailed but gradually caught up. Amid the chugging motors, spray, and tense atmosphere, the _Gem_ surpassed the leading boat, the _Bug_. However, the _Eagle_ was closing in fast from behind, making the race intense.|['1.

However, Betty and her friends opted to stay onboard and suggested a moonlit lake trip. As they set off, a burning hay barge drifted dangerously close to the boathouse. Whistles of alarm filled the air, but the _Gem_ was the closest vessel. Mr. Kennedy prepared to help, urging the girls to seek safety in the cabin to avoid sparks on their dresses. Aunt Kate bravely fetched water-filled pails and readied pots and pans. Despite the danger, they worked to anchor the burning barge in the lake. Amidst the intense heat, they kept the decks wet.

Grace was worried about finding her father's missing papers and Prince. Despite efforts, the papers and the dog seemed to have disappeared completely.

Mollie announced her plan to fetch more blankets from the boat, anticipating their need before morning. Grace was asked to assist, and they proceeded with a lantern. As the camp quieted down after chatter and laughter, the Outdoor Girls found it challenging to fall asleep. Various noises and uneasiness made it difficult, possibly due to the change from the boat or talk of ghosts. Grace, unable to sleep, decided to read to induce drowsiness. She shared chocolate with the others, creating a cozy atmosphere. Eventually, they all calmed down, and even Grace felt sleepy. After some time, they returned to their cots, seeking much-needed rest. In the middle of the night, Betty was startled by a strange sound, leading to a mysterious encounter by the lake that left them trembling. Grace later praised their unity in fear, highlighting their support for each other.|['1.

Betty noticed the signs of an approaching storm as they sailed towards Triangle Island to visit friends. Sensing danger, they decided to turn back. The storm hit suddenly, causing the boat to rock violently. Despite the chaos, Betty bravely steered the boat towards safety, refusing to give up the wheel.

"Several days passed. The girls enjoyed little trips, picnics, and time in the woods during their camp stay. They were undisturbed by the ""ghost"" legend. Mollie awaited news from home in vain. After a fun marshmallow roast, everyone retired. Mollie, in her bathing suit, confidently stood on the dock, describing the sunken canoe’s location. Grace, less keen on water, questioned how to retrieve it. Mollie explained that objects are lighter in water, recalling a physics lesson. Betty, a strong swimmer, marked the canoe’s location underwater. The boys, skilled swimmers, easily lifted the canoe, foiling a dishonest fisherman's plan.

Will felt guilty for losing the important papers his dad needed. He blamed himself for sending Grace to get them. Determined to make things right, Will kept watch in the dark, ensuring the light didn't disturb his friends. Suddenly, a noise startled him, and he suspected something was approaching.

Will and his friends were on a mission to solve the mystery of the missing saddle from Prince, the horse. After securing Prince for the night, they decided to wait until morning to search for clues. The next day, Will discovered a healed cut on Prince and evidence that the saddle had been recently removed. He devised a plan to follow Prince to where he had been staying.
