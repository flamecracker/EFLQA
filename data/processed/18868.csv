Preparations were gradually made to take the offensive. A railway was built along the Nile's banks, and a combined British and Egyptian force pushed the enemy back beyond Dongola. A railroad was then constructed from Wady Halfa across the desert towards Abu Hamed. The Egyptians captured Abu Hamed, and the movement continued energetically. The railway extended to Abu Hamed and further south to the Atbara river. An army of 20,000 men, led by one of the Khalifa's sons, was defeated near El Obeid. The successor to the project's organizer, Colonel Wingate, continued the work. The land, once a desert due to the Mahdi's tyranny, was reclaimed. An advertisement for a job opportunity was read by a man in Pimlico, contemplating his future.|['1.

Arabi and the military party currently hold significant power in Egypt, forcing Tewfik to make concessions and dismiss ministers at their command.

During a conference among powerful nations, it was decided to task the Sultan with quelling the rebellion in Egypt. However, conditions were set for his army to leave once the task was done. The Sultan's response was vague, and the Khedive was indecisive due to the overwhelming situation. England resolved to take action alone if necessary. The harbor was clogged with merchant ships, unable to unload due to striking boatmen. European residents sought refuge on ships, while some locals stayed armed in the bank and Mr. Ferguson's house. The Europeans underestimated the Egyptian forces, believing they would flee upon attack. The next day, the port bustled with activity as boats ferried residents away.

At seven o'clock, the Alexandra began the battle with a single shot. The whole fleet then fired, while the Egyptians responded bravely. The lack of wind caused the ships to be enveloped in smoke, making it hard to aim their guns. Machine guns added to the noise. Midshipmen signaled results from aloft. The forts suffered greatly from the shells. The Egyptian soldiers, though inexperienced with big guns, fought on. The Condor faced heavy fire but was aided by other gunboats. By eight o'clock, the Monarch and others silenced many guns. The forts were destroyed by the five-hour bombardment. The ships sustained minor damage. A landing party disabled the remaining guns at Fort Mex. The Egyptians did not surrender, so the British kept firing to prevent repairs. The volunteers swam ashore to dismantle the guns.|['1.

The British admiral faced a challenging situation. With no sign of surrender from the Egyptian troops, he feared a potential ambush of fifteen thousand soldiers. The bravery displayed by the Egyptian troops in battle was evident, making them a formidable force. The admiral worried about the safety of the Europeans ashore, knowing they were outnumbered. Despite the desire to avoid casualties, the admiral prepared to resume the fight the next day. The uncertainty of the defenders' intentions heightened the tension. Eventually, a white flag was raised, but it was a ploy to allow the troops to escape. The fleet lacked troops to secure the town, leading to widespread destruction.

During the attack, the defenders gathered in the ground floor office and later left the house, locking the doors on their way to the shore. They believed they were the only survivors until they found others at the Credit Lyonnais building. Gregory, injured in the defense, reassured his wife of their safety. The town suffered great destruction, but their firm was insured. They had moved to the Anglo-Egyptian Bank the evening before for safety. A doctor on board assured Gregory of his recovery. Order was being restored with sailors fighting fires and maintaining control. Despite the destruction, many Europeans were saved due to their resilient defense in the poorer quarters.

Charley Beresford oversees the police efforts on land to battle the fire, with locals compelled to help. The telegraph lines will be fixed soon, and instructions will be sought. It's expected that rebuilding orders will follow once order is restored. Most likely, everyone will be called back home until then. The plan is to prepare for a new building back home and send a construction supervisor. The situation is tough, but survival is the priority. Plans are on hold until further instructions arrive. Order is restored after a week, with assistance from marines and the Khedive's return. American ships and troops arrive to aid in recovery efforts. Shops start reopening, and refugees work on making their damaged homes habitable. Plans for rebuilding are in progress with insurance companies verifying claims.

Annie, we have two perspectives to consider. First, what is best for us practically? And second, what will we enjoy the most? Deciding the practical aspect is harder. Partridge hasn't promised to keep us on; he just said he'll try his best. It's unlikely we'll be kept on with full pay. If he planned to, he'd pay us here to save on our return to England. I doubt we'd get full pay in England. I've lost faith in my writing. I could find work as a labor overseer due to my language skills. But I worry about meeting people from my past. I don't mind the work, but it might affect Geoffrey. I could also join the army's transport or commissariat when they arrive.

One officer confirmed the commendable work done by Gregory, affirming that Wolseley's quartermaster general would also speak highly of him. Hicks expressed his desire to have Gregory as a first-class interpreter and part of the staff with the rank of captain, especially for organizing a supply train. Gregory was grateful for the opportunity but needed time to consider the temporary appointment. Hicks assured him of potential permanent roles in the Egyptian army after the initial campaign. Gregory saw this as a chance for a promising future, knowing the reorganization of the Egyptian army would create opportunities for English officers. Despite reluctance to part ways, Gregory acknowledged the potential for growth and advancement. Hicks appointed Gregory as an interpreter to the quartermaster's department, with prospects for better roles after defeating the Mahdi and restoring order.

At last, the time had arrived for Annie to bid farewell to her husband. Despite shedding tears in private, she remained strong and accompanied him to the railway station for Ismailia without completely breaking down. After Gregory departed, anxiety settled in for his wife. The garrison at Khartoum had experienced both victories and defeats against the Mahdi, but they were hopeful that the rebellion would soon be quelled. Gregory expressed his hopes of a swift end to the campaign and a return to Khartoum. He anticipated a promotion and a comfortable life for his family. Before leaving, he advised Annie on what to do in case of his demise. A month later, a messenger arrived with news that the troops were nearing El Obeid but facing challenges from enemy forces.

In a few days, a critical battle will occur. Although it will be tough, we are not afraid of the outcome. In the unlikely event of defeat, I may wear Arab clothing and try to escape. However, I doubt it will come to that. A month passed without news from Hicks Pasha. Rumors of disaster spread in the bazaars, causing anxiety. Lady Hicks tried to calm the fears, saying there was no confirmation of the reports. Nizim Pasha mentioned that the silence might be due to a messenger being captured, not necessarily a defeat. Annie, worried about her son and husband, stayed hopeful. To support herself, she offered English, French, and music lessons to Egyptian ladies.

Mrs. Hilliard was a dedicated teacher to both boys and girls, with serious lessons starting early in the morning. She taught the boys first, followed by the girls later in the day.

Mrs. Hilliard hoped for information on her husband, who might have been at El Obeid. Lieutenant Colonel Colborne discovered a native boy who claimed to have been there.

"""Dear students, the exclusiveness of some English families can be quite rigid. In the past, marrying someone of lower social rank was often frowned upon. For instance, a clergyman's daughter had to work as a governess after becoming an orphan, which was seen as a loss of social status. In some families, a governess is treated as a lady, but in others, she is considered little different from a servant. Family pride and expectations can lead to conflicts, as seen in the story of a father and a grandfather disagreeing over a marriage to a governess.

"Master Gregory, your skills are impressive. While you were away, I pondered about my future plans during your absence. I have a friend who visits weekly with fresh produce. Last year, I spent a day helping her in the garden with her two boys and a girl. Today, I proposed to her, ""My young master is departing for the Soudan. How about I stay with you once he leaves? I can cook, manage the household, assist in the garden, and I have saved money for my expenses."" We agreed if you approve. I considered the furniture; if you don't return, it's best to store them. We can pack Missy's belongings and your essentials in a large box for me to take. You can keep them with a trustworthy person for a small fee. Master Gregory found the idea agreeable, offering to cover my expenses and leaving money. He suggested I stay with my friend but assured me I could return if needed. He also mentioned selling the furniture upon his return to save on rent. He plans to pack his late mother's belongings that evening. Gregory spent the next two days organizing horse rides, changing them thrice daily. He switched from mourning attire to a white flannel suit for comfort while riding. Captain Ewart complimented Gregory's fencing skills and advised him on maintaining balance and posture while riding.

The gum bottle was shared among the group as they journeyed up to Assouan. Three travelers sealed their food bags tightly to keep out the dust. The heat in May was unbearable, and the closed windows couldn't keep the dust out, settling on everything. Gregory, like the others, looked like a dusty statue. They stopped occasionally to shake off the dust. Upon reaching Assouan, they obtained passes for the Nile journey to Wady Halfa. After purchasing supplies, they took a swim in the river to rid themselves of the dirt. The steamer they boarded was loaded with supplies and other officers. Gregory found the journey delightful, listening to the officers' conversations about their mission to rescue the Soudan. The steamer traveled at a slow pace against the strong current, taking sixty hours to reach Wady Halfa, a bustling place with railway work in progress.|"[""1.

Wady Halfa was the starting point for a railway that began years ago. Some progress was made, with buildings for officials and troops constructed. However, Governor Gordon of the Soudan rejected the financial burden and responsibility of completing the railway. Renewed efforts in 1884 were halted after British troops left, leaving materials half-buried in sand. The challenging project spanned 234 miles of desert, requiring transportation of supplies, food, and water. The railway's construction faced threats from Dervishes at Abu Hamed. Despite resource limitations, Major Girouard, a skilled engineer, led the project efficiently. Egyptian peasants formed railway battalions, complemented by locals and refugees. The line progressed rapidly towards Abu Hamed, organized into efficient work gangs. Troops guarded against Dervish attacks, ensuring the project's continuity.|['1.

On June 1st, Headquarters arrived at Akasheh. Spies had provided intel on Ferket, where 3,000 troops and 57 Emirs were stationed. The Sirdar planned a surprise attack the next day. Two columns were set up: one by the river with infantry and artillery, and the other through the desert to cut off the enemy's retreat. Troops marched quietly, deploying near the Dervishes at dawn. A fierce battle ensued, with the Egyptians showing courage. By 7 o'clock, the Dervishes were defeated, losing about 1,000 men. The Egyptians suffered 20 deaths and 80 wounded. The victory was crucial, though not glorious due to the outnumbering. The Khalifa had to divert troops from Kassala. Despite facing a stronger force ahead, the Egyptians were ready for the challenge.|"['1.

At Ginnis, twenty miles from Ferket, a significant battle took place on December 31, 1885. Generals Grenfel and Stevenson, along with Egyptian troops and British regiments, faced off against the Dervish army led by Emir Nejumi. This battle marked the Egyptian army's first encounter with the Mahdists, showing their strength under British guidance. The officer described how the North Staffordshires joined the Egyptians, advancing after the Dervishes retreated. Despite facing challenges, including clever enemy tactics, the Egyptian army, supported by artillery and gunboats, managed to gain the upper hand. By crossing the river and launching a fierce attack, they forced the Dervishes to retreat towards Dongola.

The tribesmen tolerate the Dervishes' tyranny due to their perceived invincibility. But with the Jaalin uprising and news from Kordofan, a general revolt is anticipated once the Dervishes are defeated.

Gregory bid farewell and was welcomed into a small group where they often crossed paths. He was invited to dine after settling at headquarters. The meal was pleasant, similar to his previous experiences. General Hunter introduced him, making him feel comfortable. The dinner consisted of soup, fish, beef, mutton, and more, followed by claret and cigars. Afterward, some played cards while others chatted outside. The next day, Gregory bought a horse and a camel for baggage transport, following the local custom. The officers explained the convenience of having a camel.

Gregory was content with Zaki's care for the horse and camel, ensuring they were watered and groomed daily. Zaki's dedication extended to keeping the tent spotless and providing cold tea for Gregory. Despite feeling he could do more, Zaki was assured that his time to contribute further would come. Gregory's days were busy, aiding the Intelligence Department and mediating disputes between displaced natives and current occupants. The scorching climate made his tasks exhausting, from relaying messages to listening to refugees' accounts. The lack of information on Mahmud's movements posed a challenge, leaving Gregory to speculate on possible strategies.

My primary goal is to sneak into the camp without drawing attention, pretending I've only been gone for a short while. Once inside, if asked about my origins, I'll fabricate a story about coming from El Obeid as an officer of the governor, who agreed to let me join the fight against the infidels. This tale should be convincing since troops from El Obeid are unlikely in Mahmud's camp to prevent rebellion. Many fighters follow the Mahdi due to past victories, while others join out of desperation from ruined villages. The poorly treated Mahdist army contrasts with the well-cared-for Egyptian Army, leading soldiers to defect. Despite risks, I've decided to accept the General's offer and will enter the camp on foot near Metemmeh with my son's help. If caught, the consequences are akin to those faced in battle.|"['1.

When it comes to clothing, I can easily purchase some from the locals here. Many wear the attire of the fallen Dervishes, albeit without the patches. I plan for my assistant to buy a suit for both of us. This is preferable to having new clothes made, as even if they get soiled, they won't appear old. Once bought, the clothes will be washed thoroughly, and patches sewn on. I fear I may not acquire precise news on Mahmud's plans but can gather general opinions in the camp. Any intentions to depart would likely not be kept secret among the Dervishes. We won't be crossing the Bayuda desert but will head up the river, keeping this plan secret until the last moment. To mislead Mahmud, we'll create a ruse that we're advancing to Metemmeh. Additionally, I'll select a horse and a rifle from the transport yard, ensuring I'm well-prepared for the journey.|"[""1.

Gregory was preparing for a secret mission to gather information. Zaki, his helper, was ready to disguise him for the journey. They collected the necessary items and got horses. Gregory was satisfied with his own horse. He bought weapons and all was set on the day of departure. At lunch, Gregory hinted at his absence, and his fellow officers knew he was leaving. He got a special haircut and a dye to change his appearance. Zaki also prepared a special potion for the journey. Gregory was stained from head to toe and his disguise was almost complete. He was given a pass to move in and out of the British lines. He was advised to avoid men from El Obeid and to be careful with his behavior to blend in with the locals during his mission.|['1.

The moon rose between twelve and one. They rode to Gakdul, reaching it at daybreak. Zaki scouted ahead and found the coast clear. They rode cautiously, now at the foot of Jebel-el-Jilif hills. The wells at Gakdul were different from those at Hambok, being large pools in the rocks. The water was clear and plentiful. Zaki suggested camping early at Jebel Sergain to avoid trouble. They planned to reach the river before daylight. They rested, ate hot meat, and feasted on melon. At moonrise, they set off, moving slowly through rough terrain before reaching a level plain.

Gregory and Zaki planned to disguise themselves as Dervishes to blend in with a group near the Nile. They found a suitable spot to camp and observe the surroundings. Gregory, fluent in Arabic, could act as a slave boy if needed. The duo decided to wait until evening to move closer to Metemmeh. The town was bustling with activity, and discontent was brewing among the Dervishes due to a lack of provisions. Some wanted to march north to confront the infidels, while others preferred heading to Berber for better conditions. Gregory listened to their conversations, learning about Mahmud's plans and the Khalifa's strategy.

There was a general agreement among the people. Gregory, after a while, stood up and crossed the ridge, reaching the main camp. The camp was bustling with emirs and sheiks, their colorful banners marking the entrance to their tents. The ground was covered with small shelters made of bushes and dark blankets to shield from the sun. Women were chatting or cooking, while children played around. Boys brought in firewood they had gathered far away. Horses were tethered in some areas, indicating the presence of the Baggara cavalry. Close to the emirs' tents, there was some order in the arrangement of shelters for the tribesmen. Further out, new arrivals were settling in, setting up shelters with the help of women and boys. Gregory decided to bring Zaki and the horses to the camp's edge, where they could easily blend in without drawing much attention. They found a secluded spot under some bushes, cut more for shade, and prepared to rest. Gregory instructed Zaki on the story they would tell if asked about their background. He planned to gather information by pretending to nap near the emirs' tents and overhearing their conversations. The leaders seemed to be keeping their plans secret from the men, causing some discontent among the tribesmen.|"[""1.

The camp bustled with life as Gregory entered. Men gathered in groups, while women stayed close to their shelters, chatting, laughing, and sometimes arguing. Gregory easily distinguished between the villagers, forced into service by the Khalifa, and the proud Baggara tribe. The villagers seemed quiet and sullen, resigned to their fate, while the Baggara exuded confidence and pride, believing in their invincibility. They awaited the prophecy of annihilating the infidels. Gregory, blending in with the crowd, overheard the Baggara's impatience to advance. They trusted the Khalifa's commands, convinced that victory was imminent.

Ibrahim Khalim and Osman Azrakyet discussed the strategy against the Egyptians at Merawi. Ibrahim's brother, Mahmud, was eager to attack but their father wisely advised against it. They reasoned that if the Egyptians marched through the desert, they would face hardships and losses. Instead, they planned to fortify the riverbank and let the Egyptians struggle with the river's challenges. Osman agreed that waiting for the Egyptians to gather their forces would allow them to defeat them decisively. Meanwhile, Gregory, a spy, overheard their plans but was discovered. In a scuffle, he managed to injure an Arab sheik and fled, pursued by the sheik's men. Gregory ran for safety, hearing their shouts behind him.|"[""1.

Gregory paused briefly after running a few hundred yards, listening for any pursuers but hearing none. He glanced around in the darkness but saw no one following. Turning sharply, he crossed the hill and continued his escape past the camp. The alarm had spread, and shouts echoed through the camp. He found Zaki and the horses, ready to leave quietly to avoid detection. They mounted and walked, using the stars for direction. Gregory regretted not finishing off the sheik who had attacked him, knowing that his status would lead to a thorough search. They rode through the night, picking up speed under the moonlight.

After resting for four hours, they continued their journey on foot for three more hours, guided by the stars. They estimated they had traveled about fifteen miles and worried about missing the caravan track if they kept going before daybreak. They discussed their location, speculating they were near the Gakdul line without marked resting spots. With about sixty miles left to go, they planned to conserve their limited food supply and ration it wisely. They rode slowly, mindful of their horses' fatigue, and eventually found water, quenching their thirst and replenishing their gourds. Feeling safer now, they decided to ride slowly towards the river, cautious of potential dangers along the way.|['1.

"""Our situation has improved significantly tonight compared to yesterday,"" Gregory remarked. ""It seemed touch and go then; the horses were exhausted until we found water. I wish we had more food for them."" ""They'll manage fine with the bushes, my lord. They're used to little with the Arabs; just a bit of durra occasionally when working, otherwise they scavenge.

Suddenly, Zaki noticed the Arabs ahead. As they approached, the leader greeted them, but shots were fired. Gregory swiftly retaliated, taking down the leader. The others charged, but with strategic shots from Gregory and Zaki, only five remained. ""This is good. Choose a horse, and let's go. But first, let's disable these guns and hide them before continuing."" After a brief halt for a meal and medical attention, they continued riding and soon spotted white tents in the distance.

After the surgeon treated Gregory's wound, he rejoined the officers for breakfast. He shared his desert adventure, mentioning the absence of Dervishes at Gakdul. Gregory expressed relief at finding water for their horses. Later, they traveled by boat to Merawi and returned to camp. The General praised Gregory for his courage and valuable information. The brigade was ordered to move to Kassinger, anticipating a future advance against Abu Hamed. Friendly Arabs confirmed the weak garrison there. Mahmud's forces were not moving, assuming the Nile waters were still too low. The Sirdar planned to capture Abu Hamed swiftly before Mahmud could react.

The officer advised Zaki to pack all belongings quietly as they were uncertain about the return time. Zaki was instructed to get the camel ready for a possible stationing at Kassinger. Camels were discreetly loaded to avoid suspicion. The General rode with the staff, planning to overtake Zaki. The camp was packed up, and heavy packages were sent by water. The force started the journey at sunset, facing a challenging road. The scene at night was eerie with a steep ascent on one side and the rushing river on the other. Gregory supervised the camel train, ensuring they stayed together. The troops debated marching at night or day, considering the exhaustion from lack of sleep after days of marching.|['1.

Gregory always went down to bathe in a quiet pool after the column stopped. He found he couldn't eat without a bit of spirits. On the third day, they passed the battlefield of Kirkeban, where General Earle fell. The next day, they halted at Hebbeh, where Colonel Stewart was murdered. The column reached a spot near Abu Hamed after seven days and a half. Abu Hamed lay on the river with houses loopholed for defense. The Dervish sentries spotted them near the town. The troops attacked, but the Dervishes defended fiercely. The artillery bombarded the town, and the infantry charged. A tough fight ensued as the Dervishes resisted fiercely. The troops had to batter some houses to gain entry. Many houses were found empty, with the occupants shot by Soudanese bullets.|"['1.

About seventy or eighty horsemen and a hundred Dervish infantry managed to escape, while the rest were either captured or killed, including Mahomed Zein, the governor. Arms, camels, and horses were also seized. On our side, two British officers and twenty-one black troops were killed, and three Egyptian officers and sixty-one men were wounded. Before the attack, Gregory joined the General's staff after finishing his baggage duties. The General, impatient and riding ahead without Major Kincaid's report, found himself in a sudden Dervish fire. The General held his position at the edge due to the crowded streets. Mahomed Zein, found hiding under a bed, fought till the end. The troops had to halt at Abu Hamed until stores arrived, facing challenges with the cataracts. Mahmud's potential threat kept the troops on edge until supplies finally arrived. The situation changed with news of Berber's evacuation, prompting a mission with friendly Arabs to verify the information. Gregory, accompanied by Ahmed Bey and a signaller, was tasked with notifying the gunboat of any enemy presence.|"['1.

Five minutes later, a whistle signaled that General Hunter and his group were about to depart. The journey to Berber was risky, spanning 130 miles. Even if the news of the Dervishes leaving Berber was true, some might have been sent down the river to oppose them. The camels would serve as protection in case of an attack. The expedition carried six days' provisions, and the camels could cover 35 miles a day. As they neared Berber, the gunboat encountered a problem, delaying their progress. The damaged gunboat needed repairs, so the sheik was instructed to proceed to Berber to confirm the Dervishes' departure. If attacked, they were to defend themselves and send word back swiftly.|"['1.

Remember my instructions: if you spot the enemy approaching in large numbers, ride to the river bank, dismount, and arrange the camels in a semicircle. Stay calm, aim accurately, and we can overcome the Dervishes, no matter their strength. After the break, they continued onward. The Arabs were now eager for battle, maintaining a vigilant watch. As they neared the town, tension rose, but excitement grew as they were welcomed by the townspeople. The sheik advised taking possession of a strong house for defense. The sheik's men celebrated their arrival, and the townspeople rejoiced. The sheik planned for a potential siege, stocking up on supplies.

On the 6th of September, two gunboats were dispatched to Ed Damer, a strategic location just beyond the confluence of the Atbara river with the Nile. Across the Nile, Dervishes who had retreated from Berber were encamped. The gunboats fired on them, causing them to retreat inland, abandoning fourteen boats filled with grain. The grain was sent to Berber, where it was shared among the nearly five thousand residents, mainly women and children. Supplies arrived from Abu Hamed down to Berber, carried by camels past the rapids. A fort was built at the river junction, manned by a small force under an English officer. The Sirdar ordered the railway to extend to Berber to stockpile provisions for the upcoming military campaign. A young officer named Mr. Hilliard was commended for his bravery and appointed as an interpreter for naval officers lacking Arabic fluency.|"['1.

The wide river stretched about four thousand yards across. Gunboats fired at the nearest forts, hitting them accurately. The gunners on board, both white and native, showed great skill. The Dervish horsemen fled as the gunboats unleashed their firepower. The enemy's response fell short due to the range. A shell hit one of the boats, causing casualties. The gunboats then moved closer to the forts, causing significant damage. The enemy's fire weakened as they realized their guns couldn't reach the boats. Suddenly, gunfire erupted from the eastern bank, but the attackers were repelled. The gunboats steamed up and down the river, disrupting the enemy's activities. The main character, Hilliard, expressed his desire to be addressed informally. Captain Keppel offered him a chance to command a Maxim gun in the future battles.|['1.

After completing their mission to keep Mahmud at Metemmeh, the gunboats returned to Berber. Gregory, the interpreter, had no tasks yet as no prisoners were taken. On the way back, an artillery sergeant taught him about the Maxim gun. Gregory quickly learned to assemble and disassemble it. The gunboats soon went back up the river with more soldiers and Major Stuart-Wortley. The railway reached Abu Hamed, and they shelled Metemmeh's forts before heading upriver. They destroyed a Dervish camp and reached the sixth cataract. The area was deserted. The gunboats then returned to Berber. Gregory volunteered to help interrogate fugitives and spies. Mahmud's father wanted him to return to Omdurman, but Mahmud aimed to attack Merawi or Dongola. The Khalifa refused to send supplies, and Mahmud relied on raids near Berber. The Sirdar requested white troops from England as Mahmud prepared to confront the British.|"['1.

In late January, the British brigade made its way to Abu Dis from Lower Egypt and Assouan. By early February, they reached Berber after a march from Abu Dis, covering 144 miles in six days. Meanwhile, Mahmud unexpectedly crossed the Nile towards Shendy, catching the Sirdar off guard. Crossing the river left Mahmud vulnerable, with only a desert behind him. Mahmud planned to head to Ahab along the Nile, then cross the desert to Hudi, aiming to avoid the British stronghold at the Atbara-Nile junction. The gunboats monitored Mahmud's movements, hindering his crossing efforts. During one such occasion, a boat carrying women sank, prompting Gregory to rescue one of the survivors, showing bravery and selflessness in the face of danger.|"[""1.

The commander had witnessed the invaders gaining strength and achieving the impossible by bringing up supplies for their sustenance by extending the railway towards Berber. With the Egyptian army reinforced and the British soldiers expected to arrive soon, what was once an easy task had now become a challenging mission. The Dervishes were disappointed to learn they couldn't harm the Englishman under the protection of their leader's harem. Mahmud advised the Englishman to return to his vessels or Berber for his safety. He instructed him to signal the boats at daybreak for rescue, as his presence was known and could jeopardize Mahmud's position.

Zaki decided it wasn't wise to leave Mahmud's camp, so he sat near his tent. A slave brought food from Mahmud. As evening neared, Zaki visited Gregory's tent, hoping to persuade him to escape, but two tribesmen with rifles were guarding it. Although they didn't stop Zaki, their presence showed Mahmud's determination to keep Gregory as a close prisoner. Gregory revealed he was held captive by Mahmud for saving a woman from drowning, who turned out to be Mahmud's wife. Mahmud spared their lives but kept Gregory until he could seek permission from the Khalifa. Gregory entrusted his servant with his belongings and pay, hoping to return one day.

Mahmud was unhappy with his father's lack of support, leading him to turn to heavy drinking and become harsh with his men. Despite feeling uneasy about the growing army in Berber and other threats, they believed their forces could overcome any challenge. The Dervish army, including Mahmud's command, prepared to face their enemies. Gregory, a captive, contemplated escaping but faced immense dangers due to the stripped land and the Dervish patrols. His only hope was the Dervish army's advance, which would create an opportunity for escape. As the Dervish army set out, their spirits lifted with the anticipation of facing the British invaders.

The party began early in the morning to set up tents at their resting place before the Dervishes arrived. They avoided the river and engaged in gunfire with Mahmud's forces daily. Gregory thought Mahmud would cross the Atbara and attack the fort. The Sirdar had one Egyptian brigade at the fort to lure the Dervishes, while the main force waited at Kennur to flank them. Mahmud changed course and crossed the Atbara at Nakheila to head straight to Berber. The desert march was tough due to extreme heat and little water. Mahmud learned of the approaching English forces, causing him to doubt the outcome and fortify his position. Fatma warned Gregory to stay hidden. The Sirdar anticipated a decisive battle as the Dervishes ventured into the desert, away from the Nile.|"[""1.

The Sirdar, leading his battalion from Kennur and the Atbara fort, stationed himself strategically at Hudi, a position perfectly located between Mahmud's camp at Nakheila and the Atbara fort. This move forced Mahmud to either attack or take a long detour through the eastern desert to reach Berber. The British, meanwhile, could easily receive supplies from the Atbara fort. When Mahmud failed to make a move, the decision was made to go on the offensive. General Hunter was tasked to scout the enemy's exact location with the cavalry and a Maxim-gun battery. Despite encountering skirmishes, the British forces gathered crucial information about the enemy's position, revealing the challenges of a direct assault.

Half a mile away from the camp, the soldiers stopped, and the cannons and machine guns started shooting. For an hour, they bombarded the enemy, but there was no response. The Dervishes seemed unfazed by the attack. Gregory's situation was dire. Food was scarce, and they survived on just two palm nuts a day per person.

Gregory, a captive, felt despair as he knew he couldn't save the life of the one who saved his. Mahmud, who had changed, assured Gregory that his people's attack would fail. Despite this, Gregory hoped his friends would come, as anything was better than uncertainty. He knew escape was impossible, even if his guards were removed.

Two hours later, the sound of mounted men riding in signaled the return of the troops. It was revealed that nearly two hundred men were lost, and the Egyptian cavalry had successfully retreated. As evening approached, Mahmud's voice could be heard in a heated conversation. The blanket was removed, and two men instructed him to follow. Bracing for the worst, he walked proudly to Mahmud's tent. Surrounded by Emirs and tribesmen, Mahmud addressed the situation. Despite Osman's reputation for cowardice, the decision was made to place him in the front line during the impending battle. If he survived, the Khalifa would decide his fate. The camp buzzed with anticipation as news of the approaching Egyptians spread, and preparations for battle intensified. Gregory found himself tied to a tree alongside other captured men, awaiting the imminent clash.|['1.

Gregory, a newcomer to the camp, marveled at the extensive fortifications as he was led around. The ground was dotted with deep holes, each able to shelter a group of soldiers. The perimeter was well-guarded by a tall hedge made of thorny bushes. Nearly twenty thousand fierce fighters manned the camp, ready for battle. At six o'clock, the first shot rang out, followed by a relentless barrage of shells and bullets for an hour and a half. The Baggara fighters sought cover in the pits, while others strolled calmly, seemingly unfazed by the chaos. The Dervishes emerged from their hiding spots, lining the trenches behind the fortifications. The British forces, undeterred, advanced steadily, exchanging fire with their foes. Despite the deafening noise of battle, the Camerons' bagpipes could be heard above the fray. The soldiers pushed forward, determined to confront those who had ravaged their land and killed their kin.|"['1.

When the troops charged forward, Gregory quickly grabbed a rifle from a fallen enemy and bravely joined the front line without hesitation. Despite having no ammunition, he fought fiercely alongside the soldiers, navigating obstacles and engaging in combat with the enemy. As the battle raged on, the troops pushed the foes back to the river bank, where they unleashed a barrage of gunfire on the fleeing enemies. The victory was celebrated with cheers and jubilation among the soldiers. A fellow officer named Hilliard, who had been a captive, congratulated Gregory on his escape and informed him about the whereabouts of General Hunter. Gregory, in turn, expressed gratitude to his loyal servant Zaki for saving his life and ensured his safety by removing the identifying patch from his clothes.|"['1.

"""Ah! Major Hilliard,"" the officer greeted, relieved to see him. ""I heard you were captured by the Dervishes and killed, but it seems it was just a rumor."" The officer then directed Major Hilliard to the women's area, a short distance away. He promised assistance in locating Mahmud's wife for her comfort. Major Hilliard shared details of Mahmud's capture, noting his surprising composure in defeat. Grateful for Mahmud's mercy, Major Hilliard set out with a sergeant and men to locate Fatma, Mahmud's wife. Among the veiled women, Fatma joyfully revealed herself upon hearing the news.

In the battle, the Egyptians suffered heavy losses with fifty-seven killed and many wounded. The Dervish forces faced a devastating defeat with three thousand men killed, including most of their leaders, and two thousand taken as prisoners. The remaining Dervishes fled, likely wounded. The wounded were tended to by surgeons in a nearby palm grove, while trophies from the battle were collected. The defeated Dervishes, including women, were not considered prisoners but were to be fed and protected. The troops prepared to march, with the wounded being carried by the Egyptian brigade. The women were to follow, possibly reuniting with their captured husbands. It was expected that the defeated Dervishes would join the service of the victors, showing a readiness to fight alongside those they had previously opposed.

At four o'clock, the soldiers marched off. Gregory stayed back to go with the Egyptians, taking a dozen donkeys he had bought from the troops. These donkeys were given to Fatma to help transport the emirs' wives and the wounded. The Egyptians left at half-past eight, carrying the injured from both sides. They took a longer route to avoid rough terrain, making the journey longer. General Hunter guided them to Umdabieh camp. The next day, they moved to the old camp in Abadar. On Sunday, they rested, and on Monday, the British brigade headed to Hudi and then to Hermali for the summer. The prisoners had choices to make, with many opting to join the Egyptian army. Others found spouses among the captives or agreed to marry soldiers. Fatma accompanied Macdonald's brigade to Berber. The town welcomed the victorious troops with joy and relief.|"[""1.

Captain Keppel was surprised when they couldn't find you after the battle. They searched everywhere but found no trace of you. The next morning, a white rag was seen waving, and a black man swam towards the boat. It turned out to be your man, who had rescued Mahmud's wife. The Sirdar was initially upset but later showed interest in the rescue story. Mahmud and Fatma were eventually allowed to leave together. Gregory and Fatma had helped each other, with Gregory saving her life and Fatma showing kindness to him. They parted ways on good terms, both grateful for each other's assistance.

Gregory worked in the transport department, moving back and forth with groups of camels to the railway's head. The line reached Berber, but construction officers were tireless, pushing it towards the Atbara River. The Sirdar realized more troops were needed to face the Khalifa's forces. He requested a British brigade, additional artillery, and a cavalry regiment. Preparations began with the 21st Lancers, Grenadier Guards, Rifle Brigade, Lancashire Fusiliers, and artillery sent to Omdurman. The troops stayed busy at Atbara Fort, building huts and preparing for the advance to Khartoum. The railway reached Abadia, transforming the area into a bustling site. Gunboats and troop barges were assembled, and repairs were made to native craft. The reinforcements arrived in Cairo, ready to join the mission up the Nile.|"[""1.

The six black battalions departed Berber on July 30th and reached Atbara the following day. At Atbara, the infantry divisions now had four brigades instead of three, with two battalions formed from captured Dervishes at the battle. Eager to fight against their former comrades, the new recruits were mainly from conquered tribes. Enlisting in the Khalifa's force out of necessity and a love for combat, they had previously lived as virtual slaves. The Egyptian Army offered them a much-improved status. The troops, totaling six thousand men, were crammed onto boats heading towards the point of concentration below the cataract.

Gregory was praised by the Sirdar for his hard work with the black laborers at the train. Despite his offense of jumping overboard, he felt forgiven. He continued his quest to find survivors from El Obeid, but the prisoners knew of no white survivors. The Sirdar's army was joined by impressive Soudanese companies who had marched a remarkable distance. Gregory was instructed to prepare to embark on the gyasses with the horses. He enjoyed being on the river again, his appearance weathered by the sun and his responsibilities. He organized his belongings and watched his camel and horse being prepared for the journey.

The transformation at the campsite was remarkable in just two weeks. Initially filled with black faces, it had now turned into a British military base with white tents. The contrast between the seasoned veterans from Atbara and the new brigade was stark. The veterans, tough and tanned, were ready for any challenge, while the newcomers appeared pale and weary from the heat. Many were already ill, unable to handle the harsh conditions. The journey up the river was peaceful for Gregory, offering a break from the heat. Upon arrival at Wady Hamed, the army assembled, including Egyptian cavalry and camel corps.

The gathering ended after consuming the last bottle of wine. Gregory stayed with the Major, discussing the campaign's challenges. Other officers chatted nearby. Soon, Gregory overheard a conversation questioning his rank above long-serving officers. Defending Gregory, a voice emphasized his invaluable knowledge and daring actions in the war. Despite being born in Egypt, Gregory's exceptional skills and bravery were recognized by many, including General Hunter and Captain Keppel. Gregory walked away, feeling stung by the officer's remarks but brushed them off. The next day, General Hunter departed with his troops despite a stormy night that drenched everyone.

Lyttleton's brigade commenced their journey at five in the morning on the 25th, with gunboats and steamers moving alongside them. By five in the afternoon, the first brigade followed suit, and two days later, the camp was completely deserted, with all the supplies well on their way to El Hejir. On the same day, two regiments from Wortley's column of friendly natives also headed south. The Sirdar and headquarters departed in a gunboat at nine in the morning after ensuring everything was in order. The Soudanese troops were accompanied by their wives, who carried household items and babies, marching patiently behind. One gunboat, the Zafir, sank due to being overloaded, but everyone on board was rescued. The troops encountered heavy rain, forcing them to move out earlier than planned to avoid health issues.|"[""1.

The rain persisted as the army resumed its march at half-past five, advancing in battle formation under the gloomy skies. By one o'clock, they paused at a village named Merreh, also known as Seg. Despite encountering Dervish patrols, no skirmishes ensued. A spy disguised as a Dervish, dispatched from Omdurman, revealed the Khalifa's plan to strike at Kerreri, a place laden with historical prophecy foretelling the demise of English soldiers. The troops pressed onward, veering west to exit the bushy terrain for the open desert towards Omdurman. Positioned atop El Teb hill, the Lancers observed the vast Dervish camp ten miles south. After a challenging march, they camped near the river, facing obstacles in watering their animals due to the steep riverbanks.|"[""1.

The Khalifa had a chance to strike during the stormy night but relied on prophecy, waiting for the infidels to reach Kerreri. The soldiers endured a miserable night, soaked and cold until dawn lifted their spirits. As they marched towards Kerreri, expecting a skirmish, they found the Dervishes had retreated to Omdurman. By morning, the army camped near the village, with the gunboats positioned to cover their approach. The cavalry scouted ahead, capturing stragglers, while the gunboats bombarded the Dervish forts. The Khalifa's army, with colorful banners, awaited the British forces. The gunboats targeted the forts, causing damage, while the howitzers attacked the Mahdi's tomb. The soldiers prepared for the impending battle, with the Lancers engaging in skirmishes but facing no resistance from the Dervish horsemen.|"['1.

From the top of the hill, the Dervish lines showed great excitement. Some horsemen charged the Lancers and drove back their scouts. But as the main Lancer regiment advanced, the horsemen retreated to their line. Soon, a large infantry force moved out, aiming to surround the regiment. The Colonel dismounted some men to halt the enemy, allowing the rest to withdraw. General Kitchener was alerted, and the entire force prepared for battle. The cavalry flanked to clear the way for artillery and infantry fire. The Dervishes, led by the Khalifa, observed the camp but didn't attack. The soldiers, relieved, ate their meal in high spirits, ready for a decisive battle. The night passed quietly, with occasional shots. At dawn, troops geared up as the bugle sounded, anticipating the Dervish attack. The troops were well-prepared, with shelter trenches and a line of defence.

In the center stood the Khalifa's twenty thousand strong corps. To the right, Yacoub's banner fluttered alongside two divisions led by renowned emirs. On the left, his son Osman, known as Sheik Ed Din, commanded. The 21st Lancers skirmished but were pushed back by the Dervishes, seeking to surround the British force. As the enemy closed in, British troops readied for battle. The black troops cheered as they prepared to defend. When the Dervishes were within range, artillery and Maxims unleashed a devastating assault, causing momentary pause in the enemy's advance. Despite fierce resistance, the Dervishes pressed on, met with unrelenting fire from Lyttleton's brigade.

Despite facing a fierce attack, Yacoub's force and the main body held their ground, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On the right flank, Broadwood's horse and the camel corps were forced to retreat, leaving behind three guns. The camel corps regrouped and made strategic withdrawals, drawing the enemy away from the main battle. The cavalry's actions allowed the gunboats to cover their retreat successfully. The battle intensified as the Khalifa's forces advanced from different directions. Despite heavy losses, the British forces stood firm, repelling the enemy's relentless attacks. Eventually, the Dervishes retreated, marking the victory for the British forces. The casualties were high on both sides, but the British emerged victorious, ready to march on to Omdurman.|"[""1.

It was crucial for them to reach the town before Ed Din's Dervishes to avoid a greater loss. The troops began their journey at nine o'clock, advancing in brigades. Lyttleton led on the left, Wauchope on the right, Maxwell to the rear, while Lewis and Macdonald formed a semicircle on the right. The 21st Lancers scouted ahead and encountered a large enemy force hidden near a water course. Despite the odds, they charged in, engaging in a fierce battle. The fighting was intense, with some soldiers surrounded while others performed heroic acts. The central squadrons bore the brunt of the fight, facing heavy casualties. Ultimately, they managed to drive the Dervishes away, but the charge was deemed a costly mistake, resulting in unnecessary sacrifices.|"[""1.

At the battleground, as the cavalry charged, a sudden uproar arose. A large force of twelve thousand men, led by emirs, emerged from behind the hills. The situation turned critical as Macdonald's brigade faced attacks from multiple sides. The Sirdar swiftly sent orders for reinforcements, but it seemed impossible to reach Macdonald in time. The Dervishes approached, prompting the 9th Soudanese to join the line. Despite the fierce enemy charges, the Egyptian and Soudanese troops stood firm, firing relentlessly. As the Dervishes retreated, Ed Din's division arrived, reigniting the battle. The 11th Soudanese and 2nd Egyptians defended against the renewed attacks, showcasing discipline and bravery.

The battleground was cleared, and the gunboats began firing at the Dervishes from the rear with Maxim and cannon. The camel corps arrived, dismounted, and added their firepower. Three battalions and the Lincolns joined, unleashing a devastating flank attack. The Dervishes fled at full speed, unlike their usual sullen retreat, dodging bullets desperately. Zaki stayed close to Gregory, ready to assist. Gregory instructed Zaki to calm his horse amid the chaos. The 9th Soudanese regiment's calm positioning reassured Gregory. He anxiously watched the approaching enemy forces. Reinforcements were visible in the distance. The Soudanese regiments displayed remarkable courage and efficiency under fire.

The town's inhabitants were relieved to learn that there would be no looting or harm from the conquerors. Despite the awful scene with foul stench and unsanitary conditions, the Dervishes did not attack the British with hate. Instead, they saluted them. A breach in the granary wall led to a rush for spilled grain, allowing many to gather food. The Sirdar and his brigade faced fire but managed to silence the garrison. The pursuit of the Khalifa was futile as he had escaped with his treasure. The town was in chaos, but eventually, the British disarmed the Dervishes. The next day, efforts to clean the town began, and thousands of prisoners were taken.

On a Friday, the 2nd of September, a significant battle took place. Following this, a group of boats with soldiers from various British and Egyptian units, along with officers, sailed up the river to Khartoum on a Sunday. The city, once desolate, now appeared charming with overgrown gardens and greenery, a stark contrast to the arid landscapes encountered on the journey. As the vessels reached a grove of tall palms, the remains of the government house came into view, showing signs of destruction. The troops assembled in front of the palace, with flags raised, salutes fired, and hymns played in honor of the Queen and the fallen.

The majority of the white troops will march down the country soon. Unless you have a compelling reason, it's advisable to stay in the Egyptian army. There's much work to be done before things settle, and a civil administration will offer better opportunities. Gregory decided to remain in service, influenced by his experiences and prospects. He sees potential in the Egyptian administration and plans to secure a post there. Many Dervish prisoners fought against Hicks, and Gregory inquired about it. The prisoners had fought hard, and Gregory sought information about his father, who may have been a captive. The triumphant army paraded through Omdurman, impressing the locals and prisoners alike with their discipline and strength. The sight demonstrated the power of the conquerors and the impact of training and leadership on the Soudanese troops.|"[""1.

The guns in perfect order were greatly admired during the march past. These artillery pieces had brought death to the Dervishes, overpowering even the courageous followers of the Khalifa. After the display, nearly all the captives wished to join. A man shared a story with Gregory about a mysterious white man who had led the black battalion, inspiring them to fight bravely. However, the white man had vanished without a trace, leaving everyone puzzled. This intrigued Gregory, who wondered if this white man could be his long-lost father. To investigate, Gregory traveled to Khartoum, hoping to find clues among the Greeks and Turks spared by the Mahdi for their skills.

This morning, a small Dervish steamer sailed down the White Nile with the Khalifa's flag flying. Unaware of recent events, the steamer surrendered when approached by a gunboat. The crew shared a peculiar tale of being attacked near Fashoda by black troops, some with a mysterious flag. The assailants fired nickel bullets from small-bore rifles, inflicting casualties. Speculation arose about the origin of these troops—Belgians, Italians, or French. The situation raised concerns as no foreign power should be on the Nile. Orders were issued for gunboats to head upriver, including the Sirdar with 500 men. Correspondents were directed to leave for Cairo due to the escalating tensions at Fashoda.|"['1.

We understand the pressure due to the Fashoda incident. Fortunately, we are relieved to leave. There will be a pause now. The Sirdar's actions seem justified. It's delicate, but those men must go. It's crucial not to provoke France further. The Sirdar likely telegraphed for instructions. It's hoped the force isn't French. France's animosity is strong, but war seems unlikely. We must sell our horses; they can't survive here. Some are sour about the sudden departure. We'll travel light, with only essentials. The journey down the river was pleasant. At Atbara, the correspondents were eager to return home. Gregory left for Hebbeh, hiring Arab guards and stocking up on supplies for the journey.|"[""1.

The boat swiftly sailed down the river, carried by the strong current, reaching Hebbeh by eight o'clock the next morning. Upon arrival, a boat ferried Gregory and his group to shore, where they were met by the village sheik. Gregory explained his peaceful intentions, seeking information about past events without seeking punishment. The sheik mentioned three surviving individuals who witnessed the attack years ago. These men were willing to assist in providing information, guiding the officers to the locations where significant events unfolded. Despite the destruction caused when the British forces arrived, the sheik assured Gregory of the men's willingness to cooperate in exchange for fair rewards.

Gregory questioned the man about the events at Kirkeban. The man explained how they were ordered to gather near Wad Gamr's house and attack the white men. They killed the men and took their belongings to the sheik, who paid them. The man took a jacket with a pocketbook inside, which he hid under a rock to protect his home.

"""I don't know much about their plans, but it makes sense that in a campaign like this, expenses can be unpredictable. Unlike in a regular war where costs can be estimated, in an expedition like this, expenses could vary greatly.

At dawn, I heard the victorious cries of the Dervishes, signaling my men's surrender. I cautiously moved, concealing my pistol, and crawled to retrieve a hidden book. Struggling as if wounded, I fled unnoticed among camels towards safety. The Dervishes, focused on looting, left me unseen. Thirsty and hungry, I sought refuge in the desert, evading enemy patrols. Chewing sour leaves for moisture, I planned to head towards distant wells. As night fell, I navigated towards a palm grove, spotting Dervishes conversing. Concealed by bushes, I crept closer, blending in with camels, then boldly entered the grove.

Most Arab women have knowledge about treating wounds. Saleh's wife instructed a slave to buy medicines. She then prepared a melon, extracting its juice for her husband to drink. Afterward, she served me boiled maize as I was starving from not eating for over two days. The woman generously refilled my bowl without a word. Later, the slave returned, created a poultice from boiled herbs, and applied it to the wound. Saleh fell asleep after drinking the melon juice and didn't stir during the treatment. The house had three rooms, a kitchen-living area, Saleh's room, and the guest chamber. When I finished eating, I rested in the guest chamber. Upon waking, a local doctor approved the treatment and provided instructions for further care. I had some experience with wounds from past adventures and university studies in surgery. I examined Saleh's wound and located the bullet, which had not penetrated deeply. I carefully extracted it, hopeful for his swift recovery.|"[""1.

One day, while exploring, I faced a challenge. A ball was stuck in flesh, and I needed to find a way to remove it. After much thought, I crafted a tool using a ramrod. With this tool, resembling a hook, I carefully maneuvered it under the bullet. It was a tough task, but I managed to extract the ball successfully. I was confident in the healing abilities of Saleh, an Arab man, in such situations due to their lifestyle. The next morning, Saleh showed signs of recovery, giving me hope. I decided to document my experiences, noting the progress and challenges faced. In the following days, I attended to Abdullah's high fever, advising on ways to alleviate his symptoms.

It has been a while since I last wrote. I couldn't even remember the month until yesterday. I'm back with friends now, but I don't feel much safer than I did in El Obeid. There wasn't much to write about as each day seemed the same. I thought about heading to this town, but the challenges were daunting. The desert dangers, lack of water, getting lost, and the risk of Khartoum falling before I arrived were all concerns. The Emir anticipated Khartoum's fall. Traitors in town shared updates on dwindling supplies, leading to talks of surrender. I considered traveling with them and then slipping away to shorten my solo journey, possibly finding a boat to reach Assouan before the Dervishes. But plans changed when an order arrived for El Khatim to send troops to Omdurman, including the Emir's son Abu.

The Emir acknowledged the hakim's decision to leave for Omdurman, grateful for his past help.

Colonel Stewart and Mr. Power are set to travel down the river on the Abbas, and I will join them. The General suggested it, saying I could not be of help here and would only risk my life. He believes we can manage until the year's end, but after December, our supplies will be exhausted. The General feels frustrated due to government delays. Despite Gordon's absence, I feel conflicted about leaving. We departed Khartoum smoothly until our boat hit a rock near Hebbeh village. The boat is damaged beyond repair. The locals have gathered, offering help, but I advise caution. Colonel Stewart trusts the people, but I am skeptical. Regardless, we will embark in the ship's boat with provisions for a week.

Gregory was unaware of the challenges a young man in England faced in securing a job or advancing on his own. He believed that influence played a significant role in Egypt, where his father could have maintained a respectable living despite any family disagreements. Gregory thought his father lacked ambition and energy, settling for a modest living rather than striving for success. He pondered why his father chose a lowly job in Alexandria instead of seeking better opportunities in England. His father's sudden death, just as he was about to reunite with his wife, left Gregory wondering about the missed potential. Gregory learned about the limited opportunities in England, where only a few could secure coveted positions in the public service. His friend explained the challenging path to obtaining appointments and the bleak prospects for those who didn't succeed. Gregory considered emigration, military service, or even suicide as options for those without connections or capital.|"[""1.

In professions like medicine, law, and the Church, it takes years of hard work and training before one can practice. For instance, becoming a doctor requires about five years of study and practical experience in hospitals. Similarly, to practice law, one needs to spend three years at the bar. Even after all this effort, it may take several more years before earning any money. In the Church, one must go through university or training colleges before being ordained. Without family connections, it's challenging to succeed. Luck plays a significant role, but for those without it, options like emigrating or enlisting may be necessary. The reality is that without luck or family influence, individuals with a decent education face an uphill battle in finding success.|['1.

We moved to Cairo. Soon after our arrival, he landed a job as an interpreter with Hicks Pasha. I didn't try to stop him. Everyone believed the Egyptian troops would easily defeat the Dervishes. There was some risk, but we both saw this as a stepping stone to better opportunities. The goal was not just his salary as an interpreter; we wanted him to regain a respectable position. Your father, Gregory Hilliard Hartley, valued his name and intended to reclaim it once he had established himself. He never sought financial help from his family, knowing they were in straits.

They emptied a water skin into a gourd and sat in the camel's shade to eat dates and bread. They only had local food to avoid revealing contact with Europeans if caught. Gregory left his revolver behind, relying on his Remington rifle. As dusk fell at the riverbank, they saw no signs of Dervishes. The rushing Atbara River posed a challenge for crossing. They rested the camels by the river, then continued. Passing villages, they learned of Colonel Parsons' movements. The terrain grew dense, making it hard for mounted troops to navigate.

Gentlemen, we face a crucial decision. We must either advance towards Gedareh or retreat, crossing the river here or at El Fasher. Staying here is not an option. The officers quickly reached a consensus to move forward. They argued that the troops, especially the Arab battalion, were in high spirits after defeating the Mahdists at Kassala. The Arab irregulars were brave in offense but might struggle in a defensive battle against a larger force. The camel men, although reliable fighters, were few in number. It was agreed that engaging the enemy from a strong position was the best course of action. The risky mission of sending partially trained men into enemy territory was acknowledged, but success justified the endeavor. The soldiers eventually crossed the river after overcoming challenges with makeshift rafts. The delay allowed for a warning about Fadil's movements, ensuring a safe journey.|"['1.

At dawn, the group resumed their journey. By six, camel riders engaged in a brief exchange of gunfire with Dervish scouts, who retreated. At eight, they approached a village, only to find it deserted except for a few elders. These elders claimed the Emir Saadalla had a small force and was ordered to surrender. Later, a deserter warned of a much larger Dervish force ahead. Despite the risk of annihilation, they decided to fight. The next morning, they advanced until they spotted the enemy. The Dervishes, numbering in the thousands, approached in formation. Colonel Parsons led a swift move to a hill, gaining a strategic advantage. A fierce battle ensued, with the Dervishes attempting to flank and attack the baggage. Despite a moment of panic, Captain Ruthven and his men bravely defended against the unexpected assault.|['1.

"Gregory and Zaki bravely defended their position against the relentless Dervish attackers. Despite their courage, the odds were against them, and the Dervishes managed to outflank them. In the heat of battle, Captain Ruthven displayed remarkable bravery by rescuing a wounded comrade while under heavy fire. With the help of Gregory and Zaki, they fought their way back towards safety. Captain Ruthven's heroic actions later earned him the prestigious Victoria Cross.

As the Dervishes pressed on, the main force began to falter under the defenders' fire. Seizing the opportunity, the Egyptian and Arab battalions launched a counterattack. The Dervishes, overwhelmed by the fierce assault, broke and fled. Despite the chaos, the Egyptians stood their ground and repelled the enemy forces.

After securing their position, the troops prepared for a potential counterattack by fortifying their defenses. The strategic layout of the defensive structures ensured that each building provided cover for the others, creating a strong defensive perimeter. With ammunition running low, Colonel Parsons swiftly organized a mission to replenish their supplies, ensuring they were ready for any further engagements."|['1.

In Gedareh, provisions were plentiful for the garrison, women, and Fadil's army. The ammunition arrived just before Fadil's attack. Despite the Dervishes' efforts, the defenders held their ground, causing heavy casualties. Facing sickness and the risk of an epidemic, they decided to seek reinforcements. Gregory prepared to carry a message to Omdurman for help. Choosing donkeys, they set off across the desert to Mugatta, reaching it safely. After rewarding the caretaker of the captured camels, they wasted no time and set out under the bright stars, determined to cover the distance swiftly to seek reinforcements and overcome the challenges they faced.|"[""1.

The water was poured out from the skins and refilled. They brought enough food for four days and a sack of grain for the camels. An hour later, they departed from the village, leaving the river before reaching El Fasher. They journeyed through the night until the sun rose high. After watering the camels and having a meal, they rested until late afternoon. The group anticipated reaching Omdurman the next morning and aimed to strike the river that night. Maintaining a slightly westward course, they relied on the compass for direction. By evening, they reached the riverbank opposite the town and were ferried across on a native boat. Colonel Parsons' reports praised the officers and troops for their bravery in defending against Dervishes.|"['1.

After having breakfast, Zaki was given a dollar by his superior. He was instructed to head to a large store and purchase anything he desired for a good meal. Once done, he was to lead the camels to Azim's camp. His superior mentioned that he wouldn't need Zaki until the evening. Without delay, three and a half battalions of Soudanese soldiers were dispatched up the Blue Nile using steamers. Garrisons along the river were also taken aboard. Three companies of camel corps marched alongside the bank, reaching Abu Haraz, 130 miles up the river, in just 56 hours. Five hundred baggage camels were sent as well to ensure a supply of water for the troops. Colonel Collinson, in charge of the mission, swiftly moved ahead with the 12th Soudanese and the camel corps. Upon hearing of their approach, Fadil attempted a night attack on Gedareh, which was quickly repelled. Fadil then retreated, aiming to cross the Blue Nile and unite with the Khalifa. Despite his setbacks, the Darfur Sheik and his men managed to escape and later joined forces against Fadil. With the situation under control, the Soudanese returned to join other battalions while garrisons were reinstated along the river. The Sirdar, after returning from Fashoda, left for Cairo due to a fever outbreak. Meanwhile, Colonel Lewis set out to establish Khed|"[""1.

The fifty sick soldiers at the garrison were reinforced by two hundred troops and two Maxims, allowing them to repel the Dervish attack. Colonel Lewis, with additional troops, marched to Rosaires. The gunboat supported the mission. The next day, news arrived that Fadil was crossing the river. The Darfur Sheik was sent to harass the Dervishes. Two gunboats brought more troops. The force advanced, halted at a village, and then encountered Dervish outposts. Colonel Lewis faced a large Dervish force. The Dervishes were on an island with a strong position. The Soudanese and irregulars opened fire, but the Dervishes were hard to dislodge. The irregulars crossed the river under fire. Colonel Lewis aimed to flank the Dervishes and attacked their position. Despite heavy losses, the Soudanese advanced towards the sand hills. Major Ferguson attacked a knoll on the right, while Colonel Mason's companies headed for the main position under intense fire.|['1.

During a decisive battle, the Dervishes mistakenly paused, thinking the Soudanese were weak. Fadil signaled an attack, but the Soudanese, led by Colonels Lewis and Mason, stood their ground. With a fierce fire, they repelled the Dervishes, who broke and fled. The Soudanese, joined by irregulars, maintained a relentless assault. Many Dervishes tried to swim or seek refuge in the river, but most surrendered. Despite heavy casualties, the Soudanese prevailed. After the battle, Gregory, recovering from a fever, assisted Colonel Wingate in gathering intelligence about the Khalifa's forces. The Sirdar, back from England, prepared to confront the Khalifa near El Obeid. The aftermath of the battle brought tales of bravery and challenges of restoring order in the region.|"[""1.

Gregory was often tasked with settling disputes and could be absent for up to a week. Zaki, who quickly recovered, assisted Gregory by gathering evidence from the villagers while Gregory listened to the witnesses. Zaki's findings often revealed false testimonies, allowing Gregory to make fair judgments that impressed the people. News spread of Zaki's talent for discerning truth, and many requested his investigative skills. Meanwhile, Colonel Wingate planned an attack on the Khalifa's camp with a force of Egyptian cavalry, a Soudanese brigade, and other units. However, the lack of water forced them to retreat and regroup. Despite facing hardships and a formidable enemy, Colonel Kitchener wisely chose not to engage in battle, ensuring the safety of his troops.|"[""1.

The remaining guns were quickly moved forward to support the troops and helped fend off a fierce Dervish attack. The Dervishes managed to get within sixty yards before facing the fire from the guns, Maxims, camel corps, and infantry brigade. Overwhelmed, the Dervishes retreated to their camp. The British forces then advanced, encountering little resistance as they entered the camp, where the enemy fled. The infantry pursued for a mile and a half, while the cavalry and camel corps chased for five miles. They captured Fadil's camp, along with prisoners, supplies, and animals. The casualties were minimal on the British side. Gregory, part of Colonel Wingate's staff, reflected on the battle and the importance of their victory.

At three o'clock, news arrived from the cavalry that the enemy's camp was only three miles away from where the infantry had reached. The troops continued to advance cautiously, making as little noise as possible. Despite their efforts, the enemy seemed aware of their approach, as drums and war horns sounded. The officers discussed the situation, expecting heavy fighting ahead. Fadil believed the Dervishes would attack, relying on their followers' enthusiasm. Suddenly, firing broke out, signaling an impending attack. The troops swiftly prepared for battle, and as the light grew, they engaged the enemy. The Dervishes attempted to turn the flank of the position but were met with a fierce response from our forces.

As they emerged from the trees, many Dervishes surrendered, and numerous women and children were discovered in the camp unharmed due to a slight rise in the ground shielding them from the bullets. Several Dervishes who had passed through earlier now turned back to surrender, and the cavalry and camel corps set off in pursuit. Gregory, having learned from the women, found out that Emir El Khatim and his trained men from El Obeid had passed through the camp orderly. The 9th Soudanese reported finding several chiefs lying dead ahead. The Khalifa, along with many emirs and leaders, was among the deceased. Gregory, seeking permission, rode forward to ask Khatim to surrender, which he did after a brief exchange. The cavalry was about to charge when Gregory intervened, and Khatim surrendered, touched by Gregory's recounting of his father's kindness.

Khatim and Gregory conversed about the will of God and the events that led them to that moment. Colonel Wingate expressed his respect for the bravery of Khatim and his followers, allowing them to keep their weapons and return home in peace.
