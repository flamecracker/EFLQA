Last year, I faced a challenge in selecting English Fairy Tales for children. This time, offering Celtic folk tales posed a different challenge â€“ one of choosing from a wealth of stories. Ireland and Scotland have rich traditions, with authors like Croker, Carleton, and Campbell contributing. Wales, though smaller, has potential. In my selection, I aimed for characteristic tales, avoiding the common formulas. Humor was lacking in Gaelic tales, so I turned to Irish stories for comic relief. For romantic tales, Gaelic sources were key, with some blending of Irish and Scottish elements. The tales are longer and more detailed, capturing the essence of Celtic storytelling. The effort to preserve these tales is crucial, as the tradition is fading. The dedication of Celtic folk-lore collectors is evident, as detailed in the Notes and References section.|"['1.

In this book, I have aimed to present Celtic folk tales in a simple language without complex artifice. I have retained a Celtic style of speech and some Celtic words to maintain the authenticity of the stories. These unfamiliar words add richness and local flavor to the tales, as seen in the works of Mr. Kipling. Celtic folklore is unique in Europe for its extensive oral tradition about national and mythical heroes, particularly among the Gaels in Scotland and Ireland. The stories of heroes like Finn and Cuchulain have been passed down for centuries. The selected tale of Deirdre exemplifies this tradition, blending Scottish and Irish folklore. This volume includes stories from renowned Celtic folk-tale masters like Campbell, Kennedy, Hyde, and Curtin, offering English children a glimpse into the magical world of Celtic imagination.|['1.

In a land of ancient lore, the Druid Coran cast his spells towards the place where the maiden's voice faded. Connla, mesmerized by her, saw her vanish with the Druid's incantation. Before disappearing, she tossed him a magical apple. For a month, Connla only consumed this apple, which never diminished. He felt a strong desire for the maiden and her mystical realm.

"""He'll have no good to get out of the young girl,"" said the little man who spoke to him in the palace before. He moved to her and slapped her on the head, making her unable to speak. Guleesh offered help, saying, ""I am afraid that you must spend this night in my father's house, lady, and if there is anything that I can do for you, tell me, and I'll be your servant.""

The priest appeared puzzled by Guleesh's request, but without further inquiry, he ushered Guleesh and the maiden into his parlor, seating them. Guleesh expressed concern that the girl seemed unhappy about an impending marriage, a union he and the sheehogues had disrupted. Observing the girl's blush, Guleesh sensed her aversion to the marriage. He proposed that the priest shelter her, but they lacked means to return her home. The priest decided to pass her off as his niece, claiming she was mute to deter visitors. Guleesh, growing fonder of her, worried about her father reclaiming her. Despite their inability to communicate verbally, they developed a silent understanding through gestures.

Guleesh stood amazed as the good people whisked away into the air, leaving him with wonder in his eyes. He pondered on the strange events, hoping to find the herb that could restore speech to the king's daughter.

Once upon a time, a man named Tom Fitzpatrick encountered a mischievous creature known as a Lepracaun. Tom, curious and eager, tried to catch the Lepracaun to find his hidden treasure.

The hunter, after receiving hospitality, warned that others would take the beautiful hidden woman if they saw her. He described the people of Erin as having raven-colored hair, swan-like skin, and cheeks like a red calf. The hunter then told King Connachar of Deirdre's beauty. Connachar set out with his kin to retrieve her. Deirdre's nurse refused to open the door, but when Connachar saw Deirdre, he fell in love. Deirdre asked for a year and a day before marrying the king. She was surrounded by maidens and a teacher. One day, she saw three men pass by, and realizing they were the sons of Uisnech, she followed them. Naois, the tallest, caught her attention.

Naois, along with Deirdre and his brothers, decided to leave Erin due to the conflict with Connachar, King of Ulster. They settled by Loch-Ness in Scotland, living happily in a tower. Meanwhile, Connachar planned a feast and sent an invitation through Ferchar Mac Ro to Naois, hoping to reconcile.

Long ago, in a land of sorrow and loss, the brave heroes Naois and his two brothers met their tragic end. Deirdre, their beloved, wept bitterly as they lay lifeless on the green meadow.

The princess was displeased as Tom appeared transformed in his fine clothes with a green birredh over his long curly hair. Despite getting a laugh out of her, the king approved. Soon, the dreadful wolf entered the palace-yard with Tom behind, carrying a club. The wolf eyed the people fearfully, but Tom, unfazed, played his flute. Everyone started dancing, including the wolf, who was in pain but had his eyes fixed on Redhead. Tom kept playing, ensuring the safety of the princess and the court.

Tom refused to bring the flail into the palace. No one dared to go near it. The next morning, two long cracks were found in the stone where the flail had burned itself an opening downwards. The Danes, upon hearing of the flail's presence in Dublin, were so scared that they immediately sailed away. Before Tom got married, he learned various subjects like politeness, math, and gunnery to converse with the royal family. The Celtic folk-tales are extensive, with about 2000 tales, of which only 250 are in print. These tales are among the oldest in European folklore and include fairy tales, hero-tales, folk-tales, and drolls.

"In Scotland, J. F. Campbell stands out for his collection of folk tales in the Gaelic language. His work, ""Popular Tales of the West Highlands,"" contains around 120 stories, maintaining the original language of the narrators. Campbell's dedication to accuracy sometimes made his versions seem un-English, hindering their popularity. Despite publishing only a fraction of his collection, Campbell's influence on Scottish folklore has been significant. The ""Celtic Magazine"" and the ""Scotch Celtic Review"" have also contributed to preserving Gaelic tales. Lord Archibald Campbell's efforts have led to the publication of ""Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition,"" with extensive notes by Mr. Alfred Nutt. In Wales, the fairy tales collected by Prof. Rhys and the Welsh fables in ""British Goblins"" are noteworthy. Meanwhile, Cornwall and the Isle of Man have fewer distinct Celtic tales.

In Celtic folk-tales, the link between hero-tales and folk-tales is explored. Stories of heroes like Finn of Cuchulain are also told of unknown heroes, raising the question of which tales came first. Evidence suggests that folk-tales predate hero-tales, influencing the literature of the Romance-speaking nations in the twelfth century. These tales have persisted in oral tradition, shedding light on the spirit of chivalry and European Romance. The Celtic folk-tales offer insights into primitive beliefs and conditions, such as polygamy and the concept of an external soul. However, caution is advised when using folk-tales as evidence of primitive practices, as they may have originated from other cultures.

Conn the hundred-fighter, a powerful Irish ruler, saw his son Connla vanish mysteriously during his reign. The tale tells of a fairy maiden who lures Connla away with a golden apple, leading him to the land of promise. The story, passed down through centuries, reflects the folklore of ancient Ireland. The legend, possibly pre-Christian, carries themes of magic and destiny, blending history with myth.

The story of Connla is considered one of the earliest fairy tales in modern Europe. It introduces the concept of the earthly Paradise known as the Isle of Youth, or _Tir-nan-Og_, a significant Celtic belief. This idea has influenced European folklore, such as the Vale of Avalon in the Arthuriad and even Dante's _Divina Commedia_. It's suggested that the Homeric Hesperides and the Fortunate Isles may have Celtic origins. The reverence shown to the Druids in Lucan's _Pharsalia_ hints at a different view of the afterlife, possibly similar to Tir-nan-Og. A poignant moment in Irish legend is Ossian's return from Tir-nan-Og after centuries have passed, encountering St. Patrick and representing the clash between old and new beliefs.

"**Analysis of a Legendary Tale**

The story featuring Finn and Cuchulain may not have historical accuracy due to the vast timeline difference between the heroes. Finn is believed to be from the third century A.D., while Cuchulain is from the first century A.D. The legend's bizarre nature also distances it from typical hero stories. Notably, Finn's wisdom-tooth and Cuchulain's power-finger are mentioned, indicating a theme of foresight and external soul. Parodies of Irish sagas date back to the sixteenth century, making this tale a possible example. The latter part of the story resembles the Sea-Maiden tale, while the earlier part aligns with Cinderella stories, which have numerous variations across England, Ireland, and Scotland. The legend is also found in Campbell's work as a European droll. The narrative is a reimagining of Hon. W. R. Spencer's poem ""Beth GÃªlert, or the Grave of the Greyhound,"" which originated in 1800, based on a village tradition near Snowdon associated with Llewellyn the Great and a greyhound named GÃªlert gifted by King John in 1205."|"['1.

"In the second edition of a book from 1794, a legend about Prince Llewellyn and his faithful dog Kill-hart is recounted. The tale goes that upon returning home, the Prince found his child's cradle overturned and covered in blood. Believing his dog had harmed the child, he fatally wounded the dog, only to discover the child safe and a wolf dead under the cradle. This led to the establishment of a church named after Kill-hart. The legend of Gellert, a greyhound, is linked to this story. The tale of Gellert's heroic run after a stag from Carnarvon to Bedd Gellert was likely an embellishment of the original legend. The story has become entrenched in Welsh folklore, with an ancient air named ""Bedd Gelert"" associated with it.
