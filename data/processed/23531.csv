"The Maynard children, four siblings, were making plans for the morning on a lovely September day. Energetic and lively, they were reunited after a summer apart. Their home, a big house surrounded by seven acres of lawn and gardens, had various play areas like a playground, tennis court, and orchard. The eldest, Kingdon, often led their games with creative ideas. Marjorie was just as inventive, and together they enjoyed elaborate and exciting games like ""Shipwreck."" In their imaginative play, they transformed a swing into a ship, with Kingdon pretending to be the Captain. Their make-believe journey took unexpected turns, with Rosy Posy becoming Buffalo Bill and a bear onboard. The Captain, played by Kingdon, added drama by warning of danger and urging everyone to put on imaginary life-preservers."|"['1.

Marjorie, exhausted from swimming, feared drowning until Kingdon pointed out a raft. Kitty, known for her fashion sense, reluctantly boarded the raft with Arabella. Despite many close calls, they all reached the desert island. With no food except hard-boiled eggs and crackers, they faced starvation until Marjorie found more crackers and pears. The group, now safe but hungry, realized they were stranded in the Pacific Ocean with no rescue in sight. Despite the challenges, they stuck together, sharing what little food they had and bracing for an uncertain fate on the island.|"[""1.

Kitty caught many animals, but avoided fighting tigers and wolves like Marjorie and Kingdon did. She feared being thrown down. Her fears were valid as the brave fighters were often thrown by their foes, only to get back up and continue the battle. Mrs. Maynard found Kingdon and Marjorie's rough play amusing, despite their muddied and torn clothes. Kingdon cheekily asked to have lunch in the playroom. Though Mrs. Maynard found the request unappealing, she obliged. The children had the freedom to invite friends over or keep it a family affair on Ourdays. Sometimes, Mr. Maynard took the children out for adventures to bond with them better. Marjorie expressed her dislike for school to her friend Gladys, who shared her mischievous nature.|"['1.

Gladys and Marjorie were thrilled about the upcoming picnic. They usually had Ourdays just with their family, but this time they invited some friends. The preparations started early in the week, with Ellen, the cook, spending most of Friday making delicious treats. The next morning, she would wake up early to cook chicken and prepare deviled eggs. Everyone was excited, especially Rosy Posy, who happily went to bed dreaming about the fun day ahead. The family dinner was filled with chatter about the picnic.

Mr. Maynard spoke as their carriage arrived at the front door, and Marjorie saw Gladys, Dick, and Dorothy stepping out. They all gathered in the warm living room with a crackling fire. Mrs. Maynard welcomed the children before excusing herself. Mr. Maynard then introduced a fun game called Jacknuts. The children had to find hidden nuts around the house and fill their baskets. The nuts were scattered everywhere, and the children scurried to collect them. Afterward, they emptied their baskets onto the table to play the game. Using tiny tongs, each child had to carefully pick nuts from the heap without disturbing the others. The game was challenging but exciting, requiring a gentle touch to succeed.|['1.

King, a whirlwind at the nut game, quickly cracked four nuts, causing a nut to ricochet towards Gladys. Mr. Maynard then revealed that each player would win a nut as a prize. The group eagerly grabbed nutpicks and bowls to crack open the nuts, turning the work into an enjoyable game. After clearing the table, they found an array of treats like figs, dates, and oranges on the extended table. Mr. Maynard, acting as Professor Nuttall, began teaching the children how to make candy. The boys grated coconut and chocolate, chopped nuts and fruits, impressing Mrs. Maynard. Marjorie and Gladys molded fondant into balls, creating chocolate creams. As the candy-making concluded, the children were advised to clean up for a picnic luncheon. Seven tidy children soon returned, ready to enjoy the fruits of their labor in a whimsically decorated room.|['1.

After the baskets were left near the flat rock, James and Thomas left, leaving only Nurse Nannie to care for little Rosamond at the picnic. They used wooden plates and Japanese paper napkins for the meal. While the girls organized the food, the boys tended to the fire and roasted small potatoes over the flames. The ice-cream was served from the freezer with pink and white scoops on pasteboard plates. The children enjoyed the treats after consuming a variety of foods. They then played games like Blindman's Buff and the motor-car game, creating a joyful and noisy atmosphere at the picnic.

Mr. Maynard began a fun storytelling game with the children, where they acted out parts of the story. As he narrated, the children mimicked bursting tires, speeding cars, and even running over a man, creating a lively and interactive scene. The game ended with everyone laughing and enjoying themselves. After the picnic, Marjorie's father shared how much effort went into organizing the day. Marjorie's mother encouraged her to see the bright side of going to school. Marjorie's mood lifted as she chatted with friends and entered her classroom.

Marjorie had a playful moment in class, creating paper boats and passengers for them. The teacher, Miss Lawrence, caught the giggling students and Marjorie with her creations. Feeling a bit guilty, Marjorie explained innocently that she got carried away with the idea of sailing boats on the big ocean map in her geography book. Despite the laughter, Miss Lawrence decided to let the students enjoy recess outdoors. Later, Marjorie shared her day with her family, including the boat mishaps and the playful chaos that ensued.

Marjorie was determined to excel in the upcoming spelling-match between her class and Miss Bates' class. Despite feeling like a bad speller, she was eager to win. With her parents out for dinner, Marjorie planned to sneak out to the schoolhouse to retrieve her spelling book, which she had mistakenly left at school.

Marjorie's determination remained strong, but the eerie silence of the dark, empty school sent shivers down her spine. Racing up the stairs, she attempted to sing to dispel the oppressive quiet. However, her voice quivered, creating unsettling echoes. Climbing two flights, she neared her classroom. As she grasped the doorknob, a loud bang echoed from downstairs as the street door slammed shut. The reverberation left Marjorie frozen with fear.

Marjorie and Gladys were walking to school when Gladys excitedly shared about her upcoming Halloween party. The party was set for the evening from seven to nine, a rare event for the girls. Gladys, who attended the same school as most of the invitees, distributed the invitations in class. She even brainstormed making a witch's hat, deciding it must be black, not white. To achieve this, they attempted to dye a sheet of paper black but ended up with messy ink everywhere. Marjorie accidentally spilled ink on her apron, leading to a humorous yet troublesome situation.

Once upon a time, a nameless Princess named Violetta Evangeline was finally given a name by her father, the King. With her newfound name, the Princess received bags full of letters every day, including valentines, catalogues, and even a live kitten named Toodle-Doo. As she journeyed with Toodle-Doo, they encountered a pirate who asked for a password. The Princess guessed correctly, leading them into an enchanted garden where they were transformed. The Princess became a fairy, and Toodle-Doo turned into a music-box. When a Fairy Prince arrived, he offered to play with her golden toys. During their play, a golden kite flew away, carrying the Princess outside the garden. There, she faced a dragon and extinguished its flames with a hydrant. The dragon, grateful, shared its woes with the Princess.|"[""**Question 1:** What was the Princess's name before she was named by her father, the King?\n- A) Violetta Evangeline\n- B) Toodle-Doo\n- C) Fairy\n- D) Nameless\n- E) Princess"", '**Question 2:** What kind of letters did the Princess receive after being named by her father?\n- A) Postcards\n- B) Catalogues\n- C) Bills\n- D) Valentines\n- E) Text messages', '**Question 3:** What did Toodle-Doo transform into in the enchanted garden?\n- A) A fairy\n- B) A music-box\n- C) A dragon\n- D) A kite\n- E) A pirate', '**Question 4:** What did the Fairy Prince offer to play with in the garden?\n- A) Golden toys\n- B) Dragons\n- C) Music-box\n- D) Kites\n- E) Hydrant', ""**Question 5:** How did the Princess extinguish the dragon's flames?\n- A) With a magic wand\n- B) With a sword\n- C) With a hydrant\n- D) With a kite\n- E) With a music-box"", '**Question 6:** What did the dragon do after the Princess extinguished its flames?\n- A) Flew away\n- B) Shared its woes\n- C) Attacked the Princess\n- D) Turned into a fairy\n- E) Played with golden toys']"|['** D) Nameless', '** D) Valentines', '** B) A music-box', '** A) Golden toys', '** C) With a hydrant', '** B) Shared its woes']
