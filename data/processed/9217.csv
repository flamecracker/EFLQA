Once upon a time, two lovers, Adam and Lily, planned to build a summer-house shaped like an antique temple for innocent pleasures. They envisioned a place for joy, music, reading, daydreams, and romance. As they explored their estate for the perfect spot, Lily's relative, the melancholy Gascoigne, accompanied them, casting a shadow on their happiness. Despite finding picturesque locations, Gascoigne's tales of past sorrows tainted each spot. A rocky dell with a babbling stream was marred by a tragic murder long ago, echoing with the victim's cries. Gascoigne's grim tales turned the lovers' search into a somber journey, making them question if their dream of a joyful temple was possible amidst the haunting shadows of the past.|"['1.
