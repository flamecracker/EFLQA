Two friends, Trot and Cap'n Bill, went down a twisty path to the beach. The girl managed well, but Cap'n Bill, with his wooden leg, had to be cautious. They reached the boat safely. Cap'n Bill took out candles and matches from his coat. Trot wondered about the odd things he kept in his pockets. Cap'n Bill rowed the boat while Trot steered. Suddenly, they faced a dangerous whirlpool. Cap'n Bill tried hard to steer away, but the oar broke. The boat was pulled towards the hole. Cap'n Bill held Trot close as they were dragged into the dark depths. They felt a strange force guiding them down and then up to the surface on a sandy beach.

Trot was the first to wake up. She sat up, wiped the water from her eyes, and looked around. The cavern had a soft bluish-green glow, with rugged rocks above and on the sides. They were on a sandy beach by a pool of water that likely led to the ocean. The place seemed grim and lonely, but Trot was relieved to be alive. Cap'n Bill was coughing and sputtering next to her. Trot used dried seaweed to clear the water from his face. Cap'n Bill checked his wooden leg and surroundings. He lit his pipe to calm his nerves. They explored the cavern and Cap'n Bill tried fishing with a crab for bait.|"[""1.

Cap'n Bill, an experienced fisherman, persisted despite the lack of success in catching fish. Trot, his companion, grew bored and fell asleep on the sands. They cooked a fish using seaweed and a fire made from burning seaweed. The cavern they were in grew dim, and they knew they had to leave to avoid danger. At night, they slept until awoken by a strange creature emerging from the pool. The creature had wings, legs like a stork, and a beak like a poll parrot. It was covered in tough skin with a scarlet crest on its head. The sight filled Trot and Cap'n Bill with a mix of wonder and fear.|"[""1.

The creature that unexpectedly joined Trot and Cap'n Bill was called an Ork. Despite its odd appearance, the Ork had bright and mild eyes and made no hostile gestures towards them. The Ork shared its story of how it got caught in a whirlpool and was saved by mermaids. It explained that it had a curious nature, unlike the other Orks, which led it to explore far from home. The Ork had encountered challenges, including fights with large birds and escaping airships, while searching for its way back home. Hungry and tired, the Ork humbly asked for some food, which Cap'n Bill shared. Despite the Ork's unusual experiences, Trot and Cap'n Bill found the Ork to be a harmless and intriguing companion.|"[""1.

The Ork sat like a cat, using its claw-like front legs cleverly. Its tail, shaped like a boat propeller, helped it fly. Cap'n Bill and the Ork explored a tunnel with candles. The Ork flew off with a candle, but it bit the Ork, causing it to land on a rocky ledge.|"[""1.

The Ork, nursing a burnt claw, found a tunnel near a dark lake and offered to carry Cap'n Bill and Trot through it. Cap'n Bill, sitting on the Ork's back, urged the creature to start the journey. Trot watched them disappear into the distance, feeling nervous but brave. The Ork swiftly flew through the cavern with Trot holding a candle. Despite her fear, Trot managed the ride courageously. They reached a big arched tunnel where Cap'n Bill and Trot were reunited. As they walked through the tunnel, Cap'n Bill noticed something odd about its length. They walked for hours without change until the Ork stopped for food. With limited supplies, they shared what little they had, taking a break to eat and rest.|"['1.

After their meal, they continued their journey, with Trot feeling like it would never end. Cap'n Bill noticed Trot's tiredness and realized it was nighttime. They decided to rest until morning. The Ork, with four feet, complained of more pain than Cap'n Bill, who had one wooden leg. They shared the last half biscuit, saving some for later. Cap'n Bill pondered their situation while the Ork snored and Trot slept. Later, they resumed their journey in the dark tunnel. The Ork suddenly stopped, signaling the end of the tunnel. They found themselves at the bottom of a deep well with daylight above. Their passage had come to an end.|"[""1.

The Ork, a unique creature with a mechanical propeller tail, offered to show Trot and Cap'n Bill a special trick. With a swift spin of its tail, they soared into the air. Cap'n Bill held on tight as they ascended from the well, bumping into the walls along the way. Finally, they emerged into the bright sunshine. The Ork, unsure of their location, led them to a hilltop where they saw the vast ocean. Exploring further, they found fruit trees and a forest filled with nut trees. While Cap'n Bill and Trot decided to walk through the forest, the Ork, with sore feet, opted to fly over and meet them on the other side. The trio discovered an abundance of food, ensuring they wouldn't starve on the island.|"['1.

Cap'n Bill and Trot found themselves on a beautiful island, but their initial excitement was dampened by the peculiarities of the place. As they explored, they encountered a little man with a long beard who had some interesting complaints about the island. Despite the man's warnings, Trot noticed what seemed to be a house in the distance. Upon approaching, they found a shelter made of boughs and branches, where they met a tiny creature named Pessim. Pessim shared a strange tale of eating magical fruit that caused him to shrink. The group sought refuge in the shelter as a rainstorm began, and Pessim recounted his misadventure while trying to shoo away a buzzing insect. Despite the oddities of the island, the group found some solace in their unexpected companionship and shared experiences.|"[""1.

Cap'n Bill and Trot were surprised by the story of the lavender berries that made the Ork and Pessim shrink. Pessim found it funny and laughed until he cried. He explained how he became tiny after eating a lavender berry and lived in fear until he found a dark purple berry that made him grow back to normal. Pessim led them to a tree with similar berries, warning them not to eat the lavender ones. Cap'n Bill picked a ripe purple berry and handed it to the Ork, who was perched on Trot's shoulder. Pessim mentioned how birds' feathers make soft beds, and the Ork joked about using his skin for drumheads. The Ork challenged Pessim about his usefulness if he weren't alive.|"['1.

The ruler of the island, a small man, claimed his authority and expressed his annoyance at the visitors. He suggested they leave him alone. Cap'n Bill and Trot arranged sleeping spots in the shed while the little man, Pessim, slept in a hammock. They lived off fruits and nuts, without the need for fire or utensils. Pessim's negative attitude made their stay unpleasant. They realized why he was left alone on the island. After contemplating various escape plans, Trot had an idea involving magical lavender berries that could shrink them. They decided to bid farewell to Pessim and use the berries to reduce their size. Despite Pessim's pessimistic predictions, they were determined to take the risk and attempt their daring escape from the island.|"[""1.

Trot and Cap'n Bill ate the lavender berries and shrunk to the size of tiny midgets. Cap'n Bill struggled to climb into the sunbonnet and tumbled in beside Trot, causing Pessim, the unhappy Pessim, to laugh. The King of the Island then picked up the sunbonnet with them inside and tied it around the Ork's neck. The Ork, annoyed by the King's actions, spun his tail so fast that Pessim was blown over. The Ork then flew over the ocean with the sunbonnet passengers. Trot and Cap'n Bill, feeling nervous about their fate, wished to return to their normal size and be on land. The Ork flew steadily for hours until it landed in a new, unfamiliar place. Cap'n Bill cut a slit in the sunbonnet, and they both emerged, eating the dark purple berries they had brought along.|"[""1.

The berries were surprisingly delicious, and as Cap'n Bill and Trot nibbled on them, they began to grow slowly but steadily. The larger they became, the easier it was to eat the berries, which seemed to shrink in size. After finishing the fruit, they returned to their normal size. Cap'n Bill and Trot were relieved to see the magic work on them too, not just the Ork. Cap'n Bill decided to keep three of the purple berries in a small wooden box, discarding the jammed one. They found themselves on a mountain with green grass, bushes, trees, and rocks. The Ork mentioned that there are many hidden countries around the world. They approached a stone house where a man with bumps all over welcomed them warmly. Inside, the room was simple with stone furniture, a bubbling pot on the fire, and a cozy atmosphere.|"[""1.

Trot identified the lost boy as Button-Bright, known for being found in far-off places. Button-Bright mentioned losing his Magic Umbrella that transported him worldwide, leaving him stranded. Despite being far from home, he found joy in the new land. Button-Bright was puzzled by the man's bumpy appearance, which the man attributed to fairy gifts. As snow ceased falling, birds flocked to feast on popcorn, unconcerned with the people nearby. Cap'n Bill cleverly trapped some birds using strings tied to a stone. After a breakfast of popcorn, they headed back to the house. Button-Bright, known for his calm demeanor and lack of surprise, walked hand-in-hand with Trot, showing his friendship and respect towards her.|"['1.

No one asked Button-Bright's opinion, so they decided to fly over the desert. They said goodbye to the Bumpy Man and thanked him. Then they sat in the swings, one for each bird, and told the Ork to start. The Ork's tail amazed the birds at first, but they soon flew smoothly. Trot felt comfortable, holding on tight. They flew over the vast desert, with no living things in sight. Trot worried about losing strength over the desert. Suddenly, they flew into a pink-tinted mist. As they emerged, a beautiful landscape unfolded below them. The rosy glow spread everywhere. The Ork circled over the stunning land, and the birds followed suit.

Button-Bright found a young man crying under a tree. The man, dressed humbly, shared a tale of Princess Gloria, the niece of King Krewl. The Princess loved the gardener, Pon, but the King wanted her to marry an older courtier. Pon, the gardener, revealed his tragic past: his father, the previous King, was drowned by Krewl. Pon, unbeknownst to Krewl, was the son of the deceased King. Cap'n Bill sympathized with Krewl, noting the challenges of a royal marrying a commoner.

Pon explained that his father was the Prime Minister for King Kynd, who was Gloria's father. King Kynd disappeared into the Great Gulf near the mountains, and Pon's father became King. Pon and Gloria are of equal rank, but King Krewl opposes their marriage. As they approached the castle, soldiers guarded the grand doorway.

In the court, a sullen King sat on a golden throne. Cap'n Bill boldly addressed the King, noting the lack of hospitality.

King Krewl promised to fulfill the guests' wishes, but his sinister gaze made Trot fear the food might be poisoned. The attendants scurried off to relay orders, while a garishly dressed old man arrived. He exuded arrogance and superiority. The discussion turned to Gloria's affection for the gardener's boy, Pon. Googly-Goo suggested getting rid of Pon to solve the issue. As the banquet awaited, Cap'n Bill, Trot, and Button-Bright were led to their rooms, strategically placed far from each other.

The young girl expressed her sympathy for the unusual change in the boy's voice, comparing it to a refrigerator. Despite the boy's new demeanor, she acknowledged his past kindness.

The girl was upset, wishing she was strong enough to defeat the wicked witch who had caused trouble for Cap'n Bill. The Scarecrow comforted them, explaining that enchantments can be broken, especially by Glinda, a powerful sorceress. He shared Glinda's beauty and kindness, as well as her magical abilities.

The gardener's boy timidly entered the castle, where King Krewl sat with his courtiers. The King, blaming Pon for Princess Gloria's disappearance, furiously lashed out at him.

Button-Bright shared with the Ork the events that had unfolded since they last saw each other in Jinxland. He recounted Trot's concerns for Cap'n Bill's safety, Pon's affection for Gloria, and how they were ousted from the King's castle.

Cap'n Bill, who was listening intently, suddenly leaped from Trot's shoulder to the Scarecrow's. Blinkie, the witch, quickly cast a spell, turning Cap'n Bill into an old sailor.

Blinkie, in a rush, performed a magical ritual using hair and cloth to save her own life. She created a purple cloud around Princess Gloria, turning it rosy pink, revealing her pure heart. Pon, Princess Gloria's former sweetheart, approached her timidly. The Princess joyfully embraced him, reuniting the loving couple.

The journey began with damp steps that led to a dry cave illuminated by a rosy light. Inside, walls and roof adorned with countless rubies created a dazzling spectacle. In the center, a bubbling caldron of water sparkled like flames, where the Scarecrow suddenly vanished and reappeared. Trot and Cap'n Bill found a ledge covered in rubies encircling the cavern. As they followed it, they discovered where the river plunged underground. The Scarecrow resurfaced, and with their help, they rescued him.
