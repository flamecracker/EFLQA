During a historic siege in England, scurvy plagued the garrison. Fresh food was scarce, and the men suffered greatly. A stroke of luck occurred when a ship carrying oranges and lemons was captured, halting the spread of scurvy. The garrison's efforts to grow vegetables further prevented the disease.

The sky was filled with dark, fast-moving clouds not far above the ship's mast. The wind blew hard, stinging his face, making it hard to face the storm. The decks were wet, and everything movable was gone. Green waves crashed over the deck, and the ship was under close sail. The captain explained they needed to keep moving to avoid being swamped. Bob began to enjoy the wild sea's grandeur, despite the missing cannons and irregular meals. The captain expected the storm to last three days. Bob struggled to sleep as the ship pitched violently.

As the first light of day appeared, he left his bunk without undressing, only taking off his shoes. After putting them back on, he went up on deck. Despite the storm's havoc, the captain assured him they were safe. The wind was calming, and the worst was over. By evening, the gale would subside. The brig had survived a close call, losing its bowsprit and fore-topmast. The sea remained rough, but patches of blue sky peeked through the clouds. The waves were less violent as the wind decreased. The crew, now relaxed, prepared to repair the damage. The captain anticipated a safe journey to Oporto. Bob observed the men forward, no longer seeking shelter, but laughing and chatting.

Not entirely comfortable, the ship was too near the French coast, risking encounters with privateers heading to Bordeaux. The lookout spotted distant sails, but nothing alarming. With a light wind, the brig struggled to make progress. The captain, frustrated by the slow pace, hoped to be near Finisterre by morning. Suddenly, a French privateer was spotted, closing in fast. The captain altered course to evade, but the privateer gained ground. The captain remarked on the privateer's crew outnumbering theirs, making escape challenging.

The ship was engaged in a fierce battle with a pursuing vessel. The brig strategically fired its guns at the enemy lugger, causing some damage but not enough to stop the pursuit. Bob, eager to help, hesitated knowing he might hinder the crew. The lugger retaliated, damaging the brig's sails. The situation seemed dire until the brig's crew managed to outmaneuver the enemy. Despite the lugger's relentless attack, the brig skillfully evaded and eventually left the pursuer far behind. The crew's spirits lifted as they realized they had escaped captivity.

"""It is a good-sized spar,"" he said, ""nearly as lofty as the foremast. She is carrying her mainsail with two reefs in it and, with the wind on her quarter, is travelling pretty nearly as fast as she did before. Still, she can't catch us, and she knows it.""

Then again, we may give her more westing, after it gets dark, and bear the same course the lugger is taking. She certainly won't gain on us, and I fancy we shall gain a bit on her.

The coast plays a crucial role in maritime safety. A gently sloping beach with deep water close to shore is safer than rocky coasts like Portugal's, where ships can be wrecked instantly. The Mediterranean's strong currents pose challenges for ships entering or leaving. Waiting for favorable winds can strand ships for weeks, as seen near Gibraltar. The Strait of Gibraltar, separating Europe from Africa, is historically significant. Ceuta, a friendly port, contrasts with the dangerous Algerian coast, notorious for piracy. Gibraltar's strategic location and fortifications deter attacks. The view from the Rock reveals a blend of history and modern naval activity. Algeciras, across the bay, once rivaled Gibraltar in importance, showcasing the region's rich past and natural beauty.|"[""1.

In the distance, there stands a rock known as 'the Queen of Spain's Chair,' overlooking the bay. Legend has it that during a siege, the Queen of Spain sat on that rock, vowing not to leave until Gibraltar was taken. She even swore not to change her clothes until the surrender, which never happened. The Spaniards named a color after her, a dingy yellow, which became fashionable among the ladies. The Rock is scorching in summer, earning its natives the nickname Rock scorpions. They are said to seek shelter under loose rocks for warmth or coolness. As the ship anchored near the New Mole, preparations were made to unload government supplies.

Bob was optimistic about his Spanish lessons with Professor Martos. After just one session, Bob was surprised to find himself able to form sentences easily. The professor's teaching method involved learning thirty new words daily. Bob was pleased with his progress and could already understand and speak some Spanish after just a short time. He shared his excitement with his sister during dinner, amazed at how quickly he was picking up the language. Bob contrasted this positive learning experience with the traditional Latin lessons he had struggled with for years. He questioned why teaching couldn't be more enjoyable and effective, like his Spanish lessons with Professor Martos.

Gibraltar, a fortress of great strength, faced many sieges over the centuries. In 1333, Abomelique besieged Gibraltar, and after five months, the commander Vasco surrendered due to starvation. In 1349, during a siege, the Spanish camp was hit by a pestilence, forcing King Alonzo to retreat. In 1410, the African King of Grenada took Gibraltar. In 1462, it was captured by John de Guzman. In 1704, Sir George Rooke led the English and Dutch to capture Gibraltar. The Spaniards were driven out after a day's fight, with a garrison of only 150 men.

Indeed, the doctor advised preparing for a long siege due to the threat from the French and Spanish navies.

When purchasing seeds, Dr. Burke advised O'Halloran to consider cucumbers, melons, and pumpkins for the roof garden. These plants can be grown near the parapet, allowing them to cascade down the sides, saving space and making them easy to pick. Dr. Burke highlighted the benefits of pumpkins, mentioning they would be appreciated by the fowls. He also stressed the importance of manure, which can be obtained from the fowl yard. Mrs. O'Halloran marveled at Dr. Burke's diverse knowledge in gardening, poultry raising, and even scurvy prevention. Captain O'Halloran then secured the use of a garden and arranged for the care of fowls. Bob and Manola purchased chickens and fowls from local cottages at higher prices due to scarcity. The regiment found humor in O'Halloran's new venture, which inspired other officers to start their own small fowl farms.|"[""1.

In the mess anteroom, the officers bantered about starting a farm. O'Halloran, an Irish officer, dismissed the idea of pigs due to limited space, the hot climate, and the challenge of keeping them alive. Captain O'Moore protested against working under the scorching sun, claiming O'Moores never worked. The conversation turned to lineage, with a captain suggesting that everyone descends from Adam, challenging O'Moore's claim to a long lineage. Dr. Burke humorously pointed out that if Adam and the O'Moore started at the same time, half the world could claim the O'Moore title. Despite the banter, dueling was off-limits on the Rock, and the officers agreed to hold off any disputes until after the siege.|"[""1.

"""You are correct, Dr. Burke,"" he agreed. ""I haven't thought of it that way before.

Captain Lockett expressed concern about Bob's plan to sneak aboard a suspicious ship. Joe, however, believed Bob should attempt it. Eventually, Captain Lockett agreed. Bob prepared for the swim at dusk, wearing a dark jersey and securing a belt. He slipped into the warm water and swam towards the ship. Bob followed the sound of voices until he reached the vessel.

Bob, the captain, and Joe discovered that the guns on the ship were fake and the ship was disguised to deceive enemies. The Spanish ship was armed and prepared for a possible attack. Bob swam back to his brig and warned the captain of the Spanish ship's true strength and intentions. The captain decided it was best to avoid engagement to prevent a trap. Bob's reconnaissance saved them from a potentially dangerous situation. The Spanish ship was waiting to repel a boat attack and planned to capture the brig.

Efforts were made to make the brig look untidy by loosening the ropes and adjusting the sails. Most of the crew were ordered to stay hidden below the bulwarks as a Spanish ship approached. The guns were loaded and fired to signal the Spaniard to stop. When the Spanish ship didn't respond, the Antelope fired a broadside, hitting the Spaniard. The Spanish flag was lowered, and the crew cheered. The two ships came alongside each other, and the captain rowed over to the Spanish ship with Bob as an interpreter. The captured brig was from Cadiz, carrying grain and olive oil. Captain Lockett was pleased with the prize, although the ship was only half full. The two ships separated, with some of the Antelope crew remaining on the Spanish ship. The prisoners were to be kept below deck with guards until they reached the bay the next day.

The captain's small boat returned him to the Antelope. The sails were adjusted as the two ships sailed in opposite directions. By night, they approached Alicante and turned towards the shore. The next morning, they sailed close to the coast, passing fishing boats. As they neared Cartagena, a British frigate chased smaller vessels. The captain suggested anchoring near the Spanish batteries to avoid the frigate. Despite the frigate firing shots, they safely anchored close to Cartagena. The crew found humor in the situation, realizing the captain's plan. The frigate eventually ceased firing, unable to reach them in shallow waters.

Several sailors quickly secured the fo'castle door with a coiled rope to prevent anyone from escaping. Meanwhile, Joe and two men entered the aft cabin, catching the Spanish mates off guard as they played cards. Without resistance, the mates were captured, bound, and gagged.

Bob stationed himself at the cabin door, apprehending the officers as they emerged. As the polacre sailed away, it faced gunfire from the battery, but managed to escape, engaging in a fierce naval battle with gunboats.

As the gunboats approached, the brig and its prizes unleashed a fierce barrage. The Spaniards, feeling the heat, turned back towards the shore.

"""We've been moving more silver this morning from the barque to the other two vessels. Otherwise, she'd be the most valuable prize as she has the lead on board. Right now, all three are about equal in value,"" said one sailor. ""I wonder what the captain plans to do. We haven't had time to talk this morning. You might catch him on shore; he's gone to the post office to sign papers. We've been bothered by men wanting to buy wine from the polacre, but the captain wouldn't allow it. The Spaniards could show up any moment, so it's crucial we leave while we can. It's unfortunate we didn't head straight in yesterday,"" remarked another.

""Well, Bob, word is you've been fighting, commanding ships, and impressing everyone. Captain Lockett had nothing but praise for you,"" said a friend.

""Bob, you're too humble. You're the hero this time. The owners will likely reward you handsomely. Captain Lockett mentioned owning a third of the ship, and the takings from this cruise could be over twenty-five thousand,"" remarked another sailor.

Bob's daring deeds were the talk of the town. From cutting a Spanish sloop's cable to outsmarting a ship of war, his bravery was unmatched. Captain Lockett praised Bob's quick thinking and courage, ensuring that the crew and owners owed him their freedom and riches. Bob's exploits were shared far and wide,"|"[""1.

Captain Lockett swiftly departed due to the arrival of a Spanish squadron in the bay, which included two seventy-fours, two frigates, five xebecs, and various other vessels. The Spanish forces established a blockade, anchoring their men-of-war at Algeciras while patrolling the bay mouth. Troops and supplies arrived from Algeciras, and the Spaniards set up a camp near San Roque. Some Dutch and Venetian ships managed to slip through enemy lines, carrying traders to safety. The inhabitants faced food shortages, with many forced to leave. Both sides fortified their positions, preparing for conflict. The Spanish began bombarding the town, prompting defensive measures. The Rock's strategic advantage allowed for effective counterfire. Despite challenges, a privateer successfully evaded Spanish pursuit, ensuring the port remained accessible.|['1.

From the African coast, small craft brought bullocks and sheep as the port reopened. Admiral Barcelo's fleet returned after four days, renewing the blockade. Captain O'Halloran and his wife followed Dr. Burke's advice on growing vegetables and fowls. Their rooftop garden thrived, providing abundant salad and vegetables. Melons, cucumbers, and pumpkins flourished, fetching high prices. The governor encouraged all to grow vegetables, leading to many cultivating small patches. The poultry venture was successful, with ample eggs and sales. Bob spent time with Don Diaz and studied with the doctor. Desertions occurred from both sides, with soldiers escaping via ropes but risking their lives. Reckless deserters, including British soldiers, sought refuge in the enemy lines.|"['1.

During the siege, deserters from the Spanish army, mainly from the Walloon regiments and northern provinces, joined the British lines due to discontent with service outside their regions. Some deserters sneaked through sentry lines at night, while others swam from Fort Barbara to reach the British lines. Bob was relieved he and Jim hadn't ventured down the Rock's back, as some deserters faced unfortunate fates. Despite heavy rains damaging the enemy's lines, fuel and supplies washed towards the Rock, aiding the garrison. A Neapolitan ship brought barley, a precious commodity. The arrival of a convoy led by Admiral Rodney, defeating the Spanish fleet, brought relief to the starving inhabitants. The garrison received reinforcements and supplies, but fresh meat remained scarce. The fleet's departure left the garrison with temporary relief, sending soldiers' families back to England for safety.|"['1.

During the fleet's stay in port, the Spanish blockading squadron anchored near Algeciras, protected by booms to deter British boat attacks. The Spanish admiral's visit to Gibraltar led to a prisoner exchange on February 13th before the fleet departed, allowing the Spaniards to resume the blockade. Months passed uneventfully, with the enemy fortifying their positions. The garrison suffered from scurvy due to a lack of fresh food. Captain O'Halloran and his wife selflessly supplied excess vegetables to the hospitals. News from outside was scarce, and supplies dwindled as Moorish support waned. Despite discussions about returning to England, Bob remained committed to his duties, finding purpose in helping his family and the community during the siege. The O'Hallorans' home became a hub of activity, providing comfort and entertainment to friends and neighbors during the challenging times.|"['1.

A week ago, a small ship came in with mail from Lisbon. One letter was for Bob from the Antelope owners, sharing news of the ship's sale and his share of three hundred and thirty-two pounds. They also mentioned a gift of a five-hundred-pound plate set for his services. Bob kept this a secret to surprise his sister. However, after talking to the doctor about helping sick children, he decided to escape.

Repton had a plan to escape the place and head to Malaga to bring back a boatload of fruit. He would dress as a native and speak Spanish fluently to avoid suspicion. The idea was to blend in with a group of soldiers on the neutral ground and make his way to the shore. Captain Antrobus agreed to help by allowing Repton to join their party and pretending he was a drummer. Once at the shore, Repton would swim to safety. After preparing with Spanish clothes and money, Repton followed the plan with the doctor's assistance.

The night was dark as Bob made his way to the gate with the party. Passwords were exchanged, and they moved along a narrow path by the artificial inundation and the Rock. Two-thirds of the company stayed at the main guard building while the captain led the others out. Bob saluted and went to the water's edge, wading in silently with an oilskin bag. He swam out, leaving the bag to drift far out to sea. Swimming for hours, he landed safely beyond the fort's reach. Changing into Spanish clothes, he concealed the bag and walked inland, resting among bushes until dawn. From a hill, he saw the Rock in the distance and found a secluded spot to sleep.|"[""1.

When he woke up late in the afternoon, he had a bag with biscuits and hardboiled eggs for a meal. After a walk, he found a road and waited until dark. He saw infantry and carts heading to Gibraltar. Consulting a map, he knew Malaga was far, with Estepona as the first stop for supplies. He passed Estepona, had wine and bread, and reached Marbella. He rested in a grove, then had breakfast in a tavern. Considering buying oranges in Marbella instead of Malaga, he heard about the trade situation due to the English.

"They were surprised at the boldness of this young merchant, whom they believed to be from Gibraltar; Bob thought it best to keep his English nationality a secret, as it might have made them uncomfortable aiding what they perceived as the enemy.

Bob assured Teddy that they wouldn't be seen in the dark and suggested that the fishermen might mistake them for Rock fishing boats. Once they were out of the fort's reach, the sailors rested their oars after rowing for over ten hours, silently gliding a few hundred feet from the cliff.

Bob also arranged for two boatmen to leave undetected. The governor suggested sending fish as a gift. Bob organized the distribution of fruit and fish to the troops. The doctor helped with the fruit for hospitals. Bob returned the boatmen's payment and ensured their safe departure. The doctor and Captain O'Halloran awaited Bob's return, having spotted him from afar. Bob's mother scolded him but was relieved to see him.|"['1.

"""You mustn't scold him, Carrie,"" her husband said.

Counting out oranges and lemons for the regiments and townspeople took time. Once the orderlies left, Bob sat down with the doctor to share his story. The doctor praised Bob's coolness and quick thinking during the mission to bring fruit to the garrison. The oranges and lemons helped fight scurvy, especially among the children. A Danish ship loaded with more citrus fruit was boarded during a fog and the cargo was distributed, greatly improving the health of the garrison. Bob was summoned by the governor to establish contact with Mr. Logie in Tangiers, as there had been no news for a month. Mr. Logie was facing challenges with the Emperor of Morocco and the Spaniards. The governor needed updates for strategic reasons and to ensure the safety of English families in Tangiers.|['1.

"Upon reflection, it seemed that you were well-suited for this task if you agreed to it. You have proven your ability to blend in as a Spaniard and, in case things turn sour in Tangiers and the Moors side with the Spaniards openly, you might secure a passage to Lisbon on a neutral ship and return on a privateer or warship headed here. I would provide you with a letter to request passage from the ship's officer. If no neutral ship is available, you must find your way to Tarifa or Algeciras and then navigate to this port using your own resourcefulness. The mission is perilous but honorable; being caught as an Englishman in Spain would likely lead to execution as a spy.

Captain O'Halloran spoke seriously to Carrie about the expedition. He worried that if Bob took Amy Harcourt to England, it would be a disaster. He suggested that Mr. Logie, the consul, could conduct a ceremony before they sailed. Carrie doubted Mr. Logie's authority since Amy was a minor. Amy, a close friend's daughter, was in Tangiers due to her health. Her parents were anxious about her safety, especially with the tense situation between England and the emperor.

Bob had just left his house, where he found his sister worried about him. He reassured her, saying he had many chances left, like a cat, and that he was safe for a few more years. He hinted that a rope might be more of a concern than drowning or shooting. This made her angry but helped her. Bob knew he couldn't go as he was, fearing arrest if the Moors had joined the Spaniards. He planned to dress like the Jewish traders he might travel with, blending in with the locals. He decided to get a trader's suit and a fisherman's outfit from a secondhand shop to disguise himself.

The boat silently left when they cleared Europa Point, catching a light breeze and raising the sail. They watched carefully, avoiding anchored ships. By dawn, they were halfway to Tangiers. After six hours, they reached the port, seeing Spanish, Danish, and Dutch ships. Bob, suspicious of his companions, quickly left upon arrival. He changed into a Spanish sailor's clothes, burying his own. Learning of impending British expulsion, he returned to retrieve his clothes. Bob then visited the British consulate, learning of the tense situation. The clerk confirmed the Moors' alliance with the Spaniards against the British.

Many Moors deeply regret their emperor's decisions, as sympathies lie with the English against the Spaniards, historical foes. Although the population's support is clear, dissent is risky due to the emperor's power. A list of 104 residents includes merchants, traders, and shopkeepers, some supplying ships or trading with the Rock. Mrs. Colomb passed away three weeks ago, leaving Miss Harcourt in the care of a Moorish trader. Feeling isolated, she fears imprisonment or worse. Bob Repton discusses the precarious situation with soldiers' aggression and Mr. Logie's capture, urging escape to Gibraltar.

Bob and Amy discussed their plan to escape to Tarifa. Bob, feeling hungry, suggested a council of war. He proposed pretending to be a ship's boy and a deaf and dumb Spanish girl to avoid suspicion. They decided to cross to Tarifa, a short distance, in an open boat. Bob expressed relief that Amy suggested this plan. Once there, they would wait for an opportunity before proceeding further. Bob sought advice from Mr. Parrot, who explained the risks of crossing due to strict orders against helping Englishmen.

Bob discussed with Mr. Parrot the possibility of bribing the men who had brought them across that morning to take them back. Bob suggested offering a total of three hundred pounds to ensure their safe return. They debated the trustworthiness of the men, considering the risks involved, especially with Miss Harcourt under their protection. Bob proposed being put ashore at a Spanish port by a passing ship to avoid any potential dangers. He planned to seek a Spanish merchant vessel that could take them to Tarifa or Algeciras, where they could safely disembark. Bob was willing to face detention in Spain rather than risk crossing back with Miss Harcourt. Mr. Parrot agreed that this plan seemed the safest way to ensure their well-being. Bob also mentioned the option of swimming across to Gibraltar if absolutely necessary, but he preferred the idea of surrendering to Spanish authorities and explaining their situation to ensure Miss Harcourt's safety.|"['1.

After breakfast, Bob quickly changed into the clothes of a Spanish sailor boy. He rushed down to the quay where the ship was loading cattle. The captain, smoking a cigar, was overseeing the process. Bob explained their situation and requested passage. The captain agreed for a dollar each. To disguise Amy, Mr. Parrot suggested using a brown stain from Mr. Logie's art supplies. Amy felt nervous but followed Bob's instructions. They boarded the ship, and Bob covered Amy with a blanket to conceal her.

In fifteen minutes, the final bullock boarded the ship. The gangway was swiftly pulled in, the ropes untied, and the sails lowered. Within moments, the vessel smoothly departed from the dock. With the wind from the west, the sailors adjusted the sails as they crossed the Straits. After half an hour, the sailors completed their tasks. Some gathered on the fo'castle, chatting and rolling cigarettes. Bob updated them on a fellow sailor's health, mentioning a possible ride for him upon reaching Algeciras. As they conversed, Bob noticed a ship in the distance. Recognizing a familiar patch on its sail, he identified it as the Antelope, flying Spanish colors. The ships drew closer, and Bob hesitated on whether to hail the Antelope. Eventually, the Antelope turned towards them, revealing British colors and ordering the Spanish ship to surrender. Amy was cautioned to remain still as the British vessel captured the Spaniards.|['1.

The ship was quickly maneuvered into the wind, and within minutes, a boat approached. Joe Lockett, accompanied by armed sailors, boarded the ship. He guided Amy to change into her own clothes for comfort and discretion. Bob, seeking news, discussed the Moors' alliance with the Spaniards and the closed ports. Joe advised a strategic approach to reach the Rock safely. With the wind in their favor, they sailed close to the Point to mislead any pursuers. As they reached the bay, they tacked towards the town, evading suspicion. Amy joined the captain on deck, adding to the lively chatter. Upon nearing the Point, they hoisted Spanish colors and engaged with Spanish gunboats. The brig's firepower forced one gunboat to retreat, leading to a successful anchoring by the Mole.|"['1.

Bob had already dressed in his usual clothes and went with Amy to Major Harcourt's quarters. Amy's parents were overjoyed to see her rush into the room. Bob didn't join them but went straight to the governor to report on the situation in Tangier. The governor thanked Bob for his service and decided to recognize him for carrying important messages at great risk. The governor was surprised to hear that Bob had brought Amy back dressed as a boy. Bob explained that he had to get Amy away as advised by Mrs. Hamber. Bob didn't see the difference between a boy or a girl in such situations. Amy's parents were relieved and grateful for Bob bringing her back safely. Bob, however, didn't want any special thanks and preferred not to be made a fuss of.

On the 12th of April, a large convoy led by Admiral Darby arrived at the port. It included around a hundred merchant ships guarded by a strong fleet. The garrison and inhabitants were overjoyed, but also felt uneasy due to rumors that the Spaniards might bombard the town if it was relieved. The hope was that such a cruel act would not occur, as it would not help end the siege. Suddenly, the Spanish batteries opened fire on the town as the convoy anchored. Panic ensued, with people fleeing towards safety. Officers and their families sought refuge at Captain O'Halloran's house. The bombardment caused chaos, with buildings being hit and people scrambling for shelter. The English batteries retaliated, engaging in a fierce exchange of fire with the Spanish forces. The situation was dire, with casualties and the need to relocate civilians to safer areas.|"[""1.

On the 14th, a thousand men were assigned to unload supplies, while troops worked to put out fires caused by enemy shell explosions. The troops discovered wine in the town's ruins, a luxury they had long been deprived of due to high prices. They took advantage of the opportunity, leading to a temporary breakdown in discipline. By the 15th, enemy fire intensified, forcing troops to retreat to safer areas. On the 17th, the Spanish church caught fire, prompting a rush to salvage provisions. Soldiers used flour barrels as shields, turning the flour into pancakes for amusement. On the 20th, unloading of supplies was completed, and the fleet prepared to depart. The admiral signaled departure as many inhabitants and officers' families boarded the fleet. Drunkenness among soldiers led to a stern order on the 26th, threatening to shoot offenders. Additional supplies arrived on the 27th, boosting the garrison's resources. Amidst the bombardment, Bob volunteered to assist with relocating soldiers' families and managing supplies. Captain O'Halloran's absence required protection for the poultry, ensuring they were safe from theft. Discipline was restored following the governor's order, maintaining order in the camp.|"[""1.

After a heavy bombardment, the troops faced great discomfort due to heavy rains. The water cascaded down the hills, washing away newly built banks and tents. Soldiers had to brave the wet conditions, often sleeping only one night out of three due to their duties. The rain damaged provisions stored in the open air under sails from colliers. Throughout May and June, the enemy's fire persisted, with gunboats targeting the Rock's south end. Despite the continuous enemy fire, the volunteers were relieved from duty, allowing Bob to freely explore. Bob's familiarity with officers granted him access to batteries, where he observed the impact of their fire against the enemy. He even joined a frigate on a cruise, where his past exploits were lauded, hinting at more adventures to come.|"['1.

The remaining boats would be positioned in front and behind the Spanish ship, ready to make a quick move once the battery started firing. The plan was to distract the crew of the ship by the battery, allowing for a smoother attack. The crew discussed the strategy, concerned about the number of crew members available for the assault. Despite the risks, the British sailors were eager to cut out the Spanish ship, driven by the potential honor and glory of the mission. The first lieutenant and marines were to land two miles from the battery and approach from the rear. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew would split into two groups to approach the ship from different directions. The frigate would provide support by anchoring nearby and firing at the enemy. The operation was set to begin in the dark of night, with the landing party carefully navigating through cultivated land to reach their target.|['1.

The lieutenant commanded the sailors to head straight for the huts, splitting into groups of ten as planned. Each group was to attack a hut, overpower any resistance, and seize all weapons. The focus was on collecting arms rather than engaging with the men. Once the firelocks were secured, they were to move swiftly to the next hut. The sailors, guided by blue lights, swiftly disarmed the Spaniards, catching them off guard. The officers were taken captive, and the sailors armed themselves with captured muskets. As the vessel below sounded the alarm, the sailors opened fire with grape shots. The frigate joined in, signaling surrender from the barque. The sailors set the huts ablaze and marched back to the shore, guided by a lantern signal from the boats.|"[""1.

The boat keeper challenged them as they rowed out to the frigate. Cheers erupted as they answered correctly. The grapnels were raised, and the boats approached the frigate. Once on board, they set sail towards Gibraltar, spotting the signal lights. The lieutenant noted the enemy's heavy casualties. The captain commended the crew for the bloodless victory and assigned Mr. Lyons to command the captured ship. The frigate and its prize sailed to Gibraltar, where the captain ensured the ship looked the part of a warship.

The San Joaquin sailed the next day, and six weeks later, a sloop of war delivered despatches to the admiral. The admiralty praised Captain Langton for capturing a Spanish battery and a sloop of war, the San Joaquin, without any casualties. Mr. Lyons was promoted to commander, Mr. Rawdon to first lieutenant, and Mr. Outram to third lieutenant. At Gibraltar, the governor retaliated against enemy gunboats by firing shells into their camp. The Helena, a sloop of war, bravely fought off Spanish gunboats and sailed to safety amid cheers. Minor hostilities continued with constant firing between both sides. In November, the governor ordered a nighttime attack on the enemy's advancing batteries. Troops successfully captured enemy works, destroyed them, and retreated after a massive explosion.|"['1.

The enemy was surprised by a sudden attack on their advanced works, causing chaos and panic in their army. Despite the Spanish main lines being close by with heavy artillery, they didn't fire a single shot. The attacked batteries burned for three days, leaving only sand heaps. The Spaniards took time to regroup and rebuild their defenses. Daily exchanges of shots occurred, and ships faced challenges navigating in and out. Sickness plagued the garrison, but efforts to grow vegetables helped prevent scurvy outbreaks. In February, the besiegers became active again, bringing in supplies and troops. A peculiar incident involved a single shot causing casualties. The garrison used boys with keen eyesight to warn of incoming shots. The ear was found to be a better indicator of a shot's direction than the eye. The garrison experimented with carcasses and red-hot shot, reserving the latter for urgent situations. Plans for a large-scale attack on Gibraltar were underway, with the arrival of ships and preparations for floating batteries.|"['1.

Around this time, three ships loaded with supplies like powder and shell arrived from England. It was clear that the attack would come from the sea, so efforts were made to fortify the water batteries and prevent enemy landings. Engineers started digging a gallery through the Rock to position guns. A large enemy fleet with troops landed in Algeciras, and gunboats were launched to engage them. An explosion at Willis's Battery caused casualties, but repairs began immediately. The besiegers' commander, Duc de Crillon, arrived, and plans for a formidable attack were revealed. Despite ongoing construction of enemy works, life on the Rock was bearable for the O'Hallorans, who provided hospitality and aid to others.|"['1.

While Carrie was busy managing the house and overseeing their farm, Bob always found ways to entertain himself. There was always something new happening, like work being done or changes in defense strategies. He had made friends with many of the garrison officers. Bob had been there for two and a half years and was now eighteen years old. Despite his interactions with older people and officers, he still had a youthful spirit and loved to have fun. One day, a boat arrived with a letter from the Duc de Crillon, announcing the arrival of important guests and sending gifts. The governor politely declined the gifts, stating that the garrison needed nothing extra. The enemy's attack began with a fierce bombardment, causing significant damage.

Around noon, the enemy's mortar boats and ketches tried to help their battering ships, but the wind changed, blowing from the southwest with a strong breeze and heavy swell. This prevented them from joining the fight. Our gunboats were also held back by the wind. The northern batteries near the water took a heavy hit from the Spanish lines, causing many casualties. The Artillery, however, stayed focused on the battering ships. By two o'clock, all batteries had heated their shot, and the defenders started using them. The smoke cleared, revealing the red hot shot doing damage to the enemy ships. As the afternoon progressed, the fire on the Spanish flagship intensified, despite the brave efforts of the men on board. Bob, along with Captain O'Halloran and other officers, monitored the situation. Surgeons worked tirelessly behind the batteries, tending to wounded soldiers and keeping their spirits high. Dr. Burke, a skilled and cheerful doctor, worked tirelessly, making jokes to keep the men's morale up.|"[""1.

Bob was relieved to return to the secure casemates as the battle raged on outside. The constant noise of gunfire and explosions made it almost overwhelming. As the day progressed, signs of the enemy's weakening defenses became evident. By evening, their fire had significantly reduced. Rockets were launched from the enemy ships, and flames erupted from several of them, providing a clear target for our gunners.

During the siege of Gibraltar, the enemy had 300 heavy cannons, while the garrison had 106 cannons and mortars. The cannons were strategically placed close to the shore, allowing for more accurate firing without the need for elevation. This enabled the gunners to fire rapidly without the use of additional wads. The Spanish forces, totaling 5260 soldiers, showed great activity following the failed bombardment, bringing fresh ammunition and preparing for further attacks. Despite the setback, Major Harcourt and others remained vigilant, anticipating the Spanish forces to continue the siege to save face. Eventually, peace negotiations were initiated, and the blockade was lifted, marking the end of the conflict at Gibraltar. Bob Repton, having grown and learned during his time at the Rock, returned home to England, enriched by his experiences.|"[""1.
