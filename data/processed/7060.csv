In the castle, there were walls that divided the outer and inner courts. Wooden bridges connected them, allowing defenders to retreat if the outer wall was breached. The inner wall was higher, with turrets and a keep rising above it. Gates separated the courts, one for cattle and another with huts for tenants. The largest area was used for military exercises. Stables lined the wall, and a strong exterior work protected the drawbridge. Guests were entertained with food and wine. English archers impressed the French with their accuracy and speed. The French used crossbows, but the archers' skill amazed them. The men-at-arms trained together, forming bonds despite the language barrier.

"""They are all chosen soldiers,"" Guy chuckled. ""Don't assume all Englishmen are equally strong, but Sir Eustace could have gathered five hundred equally strong if he wished."" ""If that's true,"" the captain replied, ""I believe if France and England meet in battle again, France will be defeated. However, our lord, being loyal to England, will support them in any conflict. Currently neutral, our lord's favor towards England has caused some tension, but with no recent fighting between the nations, there's peace.

"Food is plentiful here,"" the captain explained, ""we have our own herds that roam freely near the river. Our lords maintain them for their own needs and to prevent overpopulation. While we occasionally sell some, they are quite wild, making the effort to take them to market hardly worthwhile. We allow our vassals to hunt them for meat if their own cattle struggle. A truce has been agreed between England and France, with both sides eager to settle their disputes without external interference. However, this leaves us vulnerable to attacks from Burgundians or Orleanists, as we are located beyond Calais' protection.

He predicted that the Orleanists might march towards St. Pol and then to Pernes for plunder. Meanwhile, the news of the Orleanists' advance towards Bapaume and their victory there reached the castle.

Two riders arrived at the castle reporting a fire in a nearby village. Sir Eustace prepared for a possible attack, positioning his men for defense.

Sir Eustace and his knights faced a dilemma after a failed attack. The English archers proved formidable, causing the knights to reconsider their strategy. Sir Eustace's son, Henry, was tasked with observing the enemy's movements. Despite his youth, Sir Eustace believed Henry needed to learn to face danger bravely. The knights prepared for a potential night attack by reinforcing the castle's defenses. Sir Eustace anticipated a renewed assault from Sir Clugnet and his forces, led by Sir Hugh de Fruges.

Master Guy expressed his preference for daylight battles over nighttime ones due to the challenges of aiming in the dark. He believed that the lack of visibility would hinder their accuracy. However, he remained optimistic about their ability to recognize the enemy before close combat. The women had prepared torches to assist in the defense. The bowman speculated that the enemy planned to advance with protective barriers made of wattles and hides. He was unsure about the effectiveness of arrows against stout oaken doors. The archer dismissed the enemy's cannons as slow and noisy, preferring his arrows for quick and efficient kills. Sir Eustace strategized the defense, anticipating multiple attack points. He ensured the readiness of defenders and the safety of women and children within the keep. The defenders gathered on the walls, armed with water, pitch, quicklime, and stones to repel the impending assault.|"['1.

Sir Eustace, a brave knight, prepared his castle for an impending attack. He stationed men-at-arms at the bridges, ready to drop them behind their men as they rushed across. The inner court was filled with horses and cattle for safety. Sir Eustace was confident that even if the outer wall fell, the second wall would hold. He advised his wife, Margaret, and the children to stay indoors for safety. As night fell, the defenders gathered on the walls, silent and vigilant. The archers listened keenly for any sign of the enemy's approach. The men were ready, waiting for the attackers to make their move.

In fifteen minutes, messengers arrived from different parts of the wall reporting movement in the distance. A dark, shadowy mass was slowly descending towards their fortification. The captain quickly lit two torches and armed a cannon with bits of iron and nails, firing them towards the approaching threat. The besiegers, realizing they were exposed, shouted in unison. Orders were given, and the assailants swiftly advanced towards the castle walls. Meanwhile, Guy was instructed to monitor the situation and report back periodically. Archers and crossbow-men engaged the enemy behind mantlets, inflicting casualties. The enemy, armed and shielded, attempted to breach the defenses. The defenders, under Dickon's command, strategically targeted the assailants, causing significant losses.

During the fierce battle, the defenders at the castle faced a determined assault from the enemy led by Sir Clugnet. The attackers tried to breach the walls using ladders and faced fierce resistance. The defenders used various tactics to repel the assault, including hurling back ladders, pouring boiling water and tar on the assailants, and engaging in close combat with spears and maces. The archers provided cover fire from turrets, raining arrows down on the enemy below. Despite a challenging fight, the defenders managed to repulse the enemy's attempts to breach the walls. Sir Eustace, the leader, strategically deployed his men and reserves, effectively countering the enemy's advances. Eventually, the attackers were forced to retreat, leaving behind casualties and a defeated Sir Clugnet.

In the castle, there was a mix of surprise and sadness among the wounded and their helpers. A beloved young boy had passed away, leaving everyone grieving.

The fear of another attack by the Orleanists quickly faded as Artois sided strongly with the Burgundians. An army from Flanders swiftly swayed the entire province in their favor. No progress was made in rebuilding the farmhouses, as the castle remained vulnerable to potential sieges. Two peaceful months passed, during which Sir Eustace ensured the tenants were settled in temporary homes. Meanwhile, tensions rose between England and France. The King of England, angered by the Duke of Burgundy's actions, aligned with the Orleanists to reclaim lost territories. Sir Eustace faced a dilemma, unsure of England's next move. As the English forces landed in La Hogue, led by the Duke of Clarence, they pillaged the countryside.

The knight solemnly expressed his surprise at the king's demands and requested the herald to stay until the next day to provide an answer after careful consideration. Sir Eustace then engaged in estate matters and conversed with tenants before pondering the summons he had received. He understood the precarious situation due to the shifting frontier after the battle of Cressy and the looming threat of renewed conflict between France and England. The message from Burgundy, though not directly from the king, held significant weight.

The mayor issued a decree this morning due to the recent riot. The king commended the knights and gentlemen for quelling the unrest and warned the Duke of Burgundy to disregard any false reports from the butchers. He threatened severe consequences if they caused trouble again. The speaker, Count Charles d'Estournel, was alarmed by the urgent message Guy Aylmer's messenger delivered. The boy reported a violent attack on Maître Leroux's house by butchers and skinners, inciting fear for those inside. Count Charles quickly rallied his comrades to aid Guy Aylmer. They hastily gathered their men-at-arms and saddled their horses to confront the rioters. Despite the delays in assembling their forces, they were relieved to find their allies still holding out against the violent mob. The Louvre at that time was a formidable fortress with embattled walls and towers. The palace was heavily guarded, housing Burgundian troops to protect the king from potential threats.

For the following two weeks, Guy dedicated himself diligently to the fencing hall.

""I'll do that, but I don't expect any trouble until evening,"" Guy continued. ""Those up to no good prefer the cover of darkness. By then, cautious folks will be indoors, not daring to step out no matter the noise.""

""I've been out gathering news. Rumors are flying, but no one knows for sure. The butchers have guards at all market quarter entrances, letting no one through. Aquitaine sent an officer to question them, but they claim it's for the king's safety. People talk about the St. Denis gate fight.

Katarina and Agnes were disguised as boys to move around without suspicion. Katarina had learned all the tricks and ways of a boy, like whistling and shouting. Once, a taller boy bumped into her and hit her. Angry, Katarina fought back fiercely until he ran away. Her father was upset, but Katarina argued that she reacted as any boy would. When it got dark, they sneaked out of Maître Leroux's house. Guy went out first to ensure it was safe.

Guy and his companion discussed various disguises for their journey, planning to blend in with different groups. They encountered knights and leaders, including Sir Robert de Mailly and Sir Charles de Lens, before heading to the Bastille. There, two knights were handed over to authorities. The mob then attacked the houses of those who opposed them, causing chaos and destruction. The crowd broke into a silversmith's house, only to find it empty and set it on fire.

""So I understand,"" Guy said carelessly. ""As long as all hold together in this quarter everything will go right. My duty principally is to find out if there are any signs of wavering; there are no signs, of course, among the butchers, but some of the others are thought to be but half-hearted.""

The angry duke scolded the White Hoods for meddling in affairs not their own, denying any traitors in the hotel. The group, led by Simon and Guy, seized the duke's chancellor and other nobles, including the Duke of Bar and twelve knights. Amidst the chaos, the Dukes of Burgundy and Lorraine arrived, sparking further tension. The Duke of Aquitaine accused his father-in-law of inciting the unrest.

If I receive a message from you, I will travel immediately to Calais with all the forces I can gather. I hope such a message does not come, as the peace between the French factions is fragile, and soon the conflict will resume. This time, Burgundy may be defeated as the Orleanists control Paris and the king. They have the support of the Duke of Aquitaine, who seeks revenge against Burgundy. The Orleanists are strong and can issue proclamations in the king's name. If they win, English raids will stop due to negotiations for King Henry's marriage to Katherine of France. The French will not want to risk the negotiations by attacking Calais. I trust you, Guy, to lead the garrison in my absence.

Sir Eustace, in a letter, shared that Dame Margaret was gravely ill, hindering his immediate return. He advised Guy to hold the castle against plundering forces, assuring support from Calais. As the French army approached Arras, Guy fortified the castle, moving supplies and livestock inside. Sacks filled with earth were prepared to defend against attacks. Later, the Count of Montepone and his daughter, Katarina, arrived unexpectedly. The Count, grateful for Guy's help saving Orleanist nobles, reassured him of his influential connections, easing fears of an imminent attack. Katarina, disguised as a boy, was to be sent to England for safety.|"['1.

Two men, Long Tom and another, were called upon to accompany Guy as they went out hawking, returning with seven or eight partridges caught by hawks. Guy suggested serving the meal in the lady's room, and she accepted, retiring early. Guy, dining alone, pondered the changes in her since growing into a woman. The town of Arras resisted the siege fiercely, with the garrison making sorties and inflicting losses on the besiegers. An armistice was arranged after the Duke of Brabant arrived for peace negotiations. Three weeks later, Sir Eustace arrived at the castle, accompanied by his esquire and men-at-arms. Sir Eustace revealed his reasons for coming, including overseeing the estate and attending negotiations in Paris.

During a visit to Winchester, news arrived that Villeroy was unlikely to be attacked. The Earl of Dorset, along with a group of nobles, was preparing to cross the Channel for a specific purpose. The king discussed the defense of the castle and Dame Margaret's situation. Plans were made for an embassy to Paris. Sir Eustace arranged for a grand show of attire and a strong defense strategy involving sacks to protect against enemy attacks. In January 1414, the Earl of Dorset and his retinue arrived in Calais. They were joined by Sir Eustace as they headed towards Paris, impressing the locals with their grand appearance. The English ambassadors proposed terms to the French court, including demands for territories. The French court found the terms unacceptable and planned to send an embassy to England. Sir Eustace and his party returned to Villeroy, while Sir John Aylmer stayed behind as castellan. Long Tom requested to go to England briefly.|['1.

In the past, Sir Eustace faced confusion with the countess, Katarina, who seemed different from their time in Paris. Dame Margaret explained that Katarina had grown into a young woman since then, and Sir Eustace, now nineteen, was seen more as a man than a comrade. As war preparations unfolded, a French embassy proposed a marriage alliance, but it was declined, leading to tensions and war readiness in both countries. Amidst the political turmoil, a plot against King Henry's life was foiled, resulting in the execution of the conspirators. As the English troops gathered in Southampton for embarkation, Sir Eustace introduced his loyal esquire, Guy Aylmer, to the king, who praised Guy's bravery and loyalty, ensuring him a place near the king in battle.|"['1.

Long Tom, the archer in command, conversed with Master Guy about the upcoming battle against the French. They discussed the historical significance of the Battle of Crecy, where an English king last commanded an army against France. Long Tom expressed concerns about being outnumbered but believed in the strength of their leadership. As they sailed towards Harfleur, they anticipated a tough fight due to the fortified defenses. Upon landing, the English army faced resistance from the garrison, reinforced by knights and men-at-arms. Despite facing challenges like dysentery and food shortages, the English persevered and eventually captured Harfleur. The victory resulted in the division of treasure among the troops and the return of prisoners and booty to England.

The English king was waiting for a response to his challenge to the Duke of Aquitaine for a duel, but the Duke was more interested in pleasure than fighting and did not reply. Despite advice to travel by sea to Calais, the king was determined to march across the country to show he was not afraid. His army, around 9,000 men, faced challenges near the river Somme as the French forces blocked their way. After failed attempts to cross, a ford was discovered, and a successful crossing was made with the help of Sir Eustace. The French constable, unable to stop the English, fell back. The English continued towards Calais, unfazed by the French threat of battle. The constable finally decided to confront the English near the villages of Ruissanville and Agincourt. The English prepared for battle, confident in their strategy and the challenging terrain that would hinder the larger French army.|"[""1.

Guy was summoned and joined the officers. They went to the wood on the right of the French division, then moved in front of it just fifty yards away from the French line. The comparison between the French and English camps was stark. The English camp was peaceful, with soldiers resting after a meal, undisturbed by the wet ground and rain, tired from marching but in good spirits, ready to face their foes the next day. In contrast, the French camp was chaotic, with different troops under separate commanders, shouting and giving orders. Many French soldiers stayed on horseback all night, around fires, discussing capturing the English king and nobles for ransom. Guy and the officers checked the left wood and found no large group of men. They reported back to the king. Guy then rested until the army woke at three in the morning. The English king had musicians play cheerful tunes to uplift the soldiers, while the French lacked such morale boosters. The French army, though fatigued, remained confident of victory. The English, having lost soldiers to sickness, faced overwhelming odds but remained determined. The English army formed up, with archers in front and stakes driven into the ground to create a barrier. The baggage and horses were secured, and the king rode along the ranks, encouraging his men and expressing his resolve to conquer or die. The archers were reminded of the fate of their comrades at Soissons by the king, who assured them that God would be on their side in the|['1.

The Duke of Berri strongly advised the French council not to initiate the attack, recalling the disastrous outcomes at Crecy and Poitiers. He suggested waiting for the English assault. However, the English had no plans to attack. Henry anticipated the chaos that would ensue when the vast French army tried to advance. Both armies sat down, and food was served. The constable resisted moving, despite pressure from the Duke of Orleans and other young nobles eager to charge. The French army watched each other for hours until Henry secretly sent archers to flank and attack the French. The archers unleashed a barrage of arrows, causing havoc among the French knights. The horses stumbled, and the knights were overwhelmed by the accurate arrow shots. The French knights faced a relentless storm of arrows, leading to chaos and heavy casualties.|"['1.

The second line of battle was now chaotic. Sir Clugnet's party was fleeing, struck by arrows from the English archers in the woods. Wounded knights tried to retreat, while others tried to take their place. The disorder grew worse as the archers advanced, causing the French to recoil. The archers, dropping their bows, charged at the horsemen with loud shouts. The French knights, stuck in deep mud, were vulnerable. The English archers took advantage, bursting into the crowd. The Constable of France and many nobles fell. The Duke de Brabant charged but was killed. The king halted the archers, reformed them, and the French couldn't regain their ground due to the muddy terrain. The battle raged on, with the English gaining ground. The French knights made desperate attempts to reach the king but were repelled. The Duke of Clarence was wounded, and the king was attacked but defended by his knights. The Duke of Alençon charged and killed the Duke of York but was slain by Guy Aylmer. The French army then began to retreat as the English emerged victorious.|"['1.

Unaware of the true strength of the enemy, Henry mistakenly thought the Duke of Brittany's reinforcements had arrived. The French, also misled, paused and turned to face what they believed was a two-front attack. Fearing overwhelming forces, Henry ordered the execution of prisoners, a command later revoked when the situation became clear. The French's third division retreated, concluding the battle. The village where the conflict occurred was named Agincourt, although the French spelling was Azincourt. The French suffered heavy losses, including many nobles and leaders. The English casualties varied in reports, with significant plunder but little food. Guy, commended for his bravery, was offered lands and knighthood. The army later marched to Calais, with plans for Sir Eustace's future discussed. The king praised Guy and Sir John, foreseeing their future success in battle.|"[""1.

The king, weakened by sickness and hunger, led his army back to England after a triumphant victory. Despite the joyous welcome from his subjects, the king faced the challenge of rebuilding his army for future battles. Meanwhile, a young count named Aylmer found himself a prisoner but was hopeful for his release through the help of Sir Eustace. The count, eager to exchange his estate for a more strategic one, sought the counsel of Guy, who was familiar with the situation. The count believed that securing the fief of Villeroy, currently held by a vassal of England, would benefit Burgundy and France alike. The count's plan hinged on the cooperation of his father and the shifting political landscape.|"['1.

Guy easily arranged for D'Estournel's captor to be paid his ransom before sailing. He watched his friend ride to St. Omar with a pass through English territory. After escorting the king to London, they rode to Summerley. Long Tom and his friends had already arrived from Dover. The castle celebrated their return with great joy. Tenants and people from afar welcomed the heroes. Guy had been knighted, and Dame Margaret and Agnes congratulated him warmly. Katarina, less warmly, also congratulated him. In the evening, she changed her tone and teased him about his new knighthood. Guy stayed at Summerley for months. Sir William Bailey asked for Agnes' hand during their absence. Agnes agreed to wed him upon her father's approval. The Emperor Sigismund visited England and Paris to reconcile the countries, but failed. The civil war in France continued. Count d'Estournel successfully transferred Villeroy to Burgundy. Agnes married Sir William Bailey amid celebrations at Summerley. Sir Eustace became Baron Eustace of Summerley.

Guy and his group were on a small ship, a situation he preferred as a new knight. They were part of an English fleet facing a tough challenge off the coast of Harfleur. The French had a formidable fleet, including Genoese vessels, galleys, and ships from Spain. A night meeting was held to plan the battle. The next day, the French ships moved out to fight. Despite being outnumbered, the English were ready. A fierce battle ensued at sea, where no quarter was given. Guy's ship engaged a large French vessel, and a brutal fight broke out.
