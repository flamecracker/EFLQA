When the deaf mute reached the tower's base, there was enough light to spot a massive chain hanging halfway from the parapet. He assembled a ladder from his saddle-wallet, pieced it together like a puzzle, and hoisted it to meet the chain. Once at the tower's peak, he lowered a chair for a woman and child to ascend, never to return. The man dismantled the ladder, vanished across the plain, and returned monthly with provisions. Prince Dolor, lacking love but surrounded by luxury, began learning lessons from his nurse, a kind yet wicked woman. As he grew melancholic, yearning for freedom, a tiny old woman with a cane appeared behind him. This encounter stirred memories of his godmother and a cloak that he cherished.

The young prince refused to turn back, determined to explore the world ahead. Yearning for even the simplest comforts, he wished for a ragged rug to shield him from the rain and a meager meal to stave off hunger.
