Fatty was fortunate to react quickly when the dog chased him. The dog swiftly closed in on him, leaving Fatty with no choice but to climb a nearby tree, a sturdy oak beyond the fence.

Johnnie, determined to catch Fatty, tried chopping the oak but abandoned the effort due to the tree's size and hardness.

One evening, Fatty Coon was leisurely walking down the valley road after feasting in Farmer Green's apple orchard. The night was dark, and the road was deserted. Suddenly, a loud noise startled Fatty as he saw the big chestnut tree starting to lean towards the woods. Fearing for his safety, Fatty climbed to the top of the tree to escape the danger.

Once upon a time, Fatty the raccoon was out for a walk when he heard a strange sound in the air. Despite feeling drowsy from eating too many apples, he perked up when the noise grew louder. Startled, Fatty paused in the middle of the road, where a mysterious creature with glaring eyes approached him.

"""No, Mother!"" Fatty declared, knowing an adventure near Farmer Green's house wouldn't suit him. He vowed to steer clear of that place. But fate had other plans.

When Fatty Coon arrived at Farmer Green's yard, he easily spotted the oak tree where the turkeys were perched. In no time, Fatty climbed the tree and found four plump turkeys sleeping on the lowest branch. He grabbed one by the neck to silence it, but as he tried to take it, the turkey flapped its wings, waking the others. Soon, all the turkeys were gobbling and flying off, causing chaos. Fatty, hearing Farmer Green's dog barking, rushed into the woods, climbing trees to escape. Jasper Jay, who didn't like Fatty, found the situation amusing. Fatty, full from corn, was uninterested in the turkeys. Later, Jimmy Rabbit called out to Fatty for a friendly chat.|"[""1.

"""We need you for the barber's pole,"" Jimmy explained to Fatty. ""You can come inside the hollow tree and stick your tail out through a hole. It will make a fine barber's pole--though the stripes DO run the wrong way, to be sure."" With that, Jimmy Rabbit began. He clipped and snipped at Fatty's head, pausing now and then to see the effect. Fatty felt a bit uneasy as he looked down and saw his beautiful mustache lying at his feet. ""You haven't cut it too short, I hope,"" he said. Fatty felt very foolish, but he made up his mind to get even with Jimmy Rabbit.

Playing barber-shop turned out to be less fun than expected for Fatty and Blackie, the forest-people. No one dared to approach the old sycamore tree where they were pretending to cut hair, fearing the brothers might get hungry and eat a rabbit or squirrel. Fatty offered to cut Blackie's hair, but Blackie refused, remembering the disaster when Fatty tried cutting his own hair before. Instead, Blackie offered to cut Fatty's hair, which wasn't much left. As they quarreled inside the tree, trying to stick their tails out, Fatty got his tail stuck. Mrs. Coon, who was watching, scared them to teach a lesson. Fatty learned a valuable lesson about the risks of playing pranks and was relieved his tail was freed before any real danger came their way.|"['1.

After searching the swamp and woods all afternoon, Fatty realized there was no food to be found due to the snow covering the ground. Hungry and discouraged, he decided to head to Farmer Green's place. Waiting behind the fence until dark, Fatty sneaked into the barnyard. A tempting smell led him to the smokehouse, where rows of hams hung above white ashes from the smoking process. Fatty, undeterred by the darkness, began devouring the hams. His hunger drove him to eat voraciously until a mishap sent him crashing to the floor with a ham on top of him, nearly knocking him out.|"[""1.

Fatty Coon was thrilled to find an abundance of treats waiting for him. He happily scavenged for potato peelings, bacon bits, and even a delicious piece of cornbread that he gobbled up eagerly. Discovering a box filled with dried apple scraps, he enjoyed their unique taste, despite not being juicy like regular apples. Feeling thirsty, Fatty headed to a nearby brook where the loggers had cut a hole in the ice for water. After drinking to quench his thirst, he noticed his stomach felt tight, and his sides were bulging more than usual. Unaware of the box's label indicating they were dried apples, Fatty's discomfort grew as the apples expanded in his stomach after drinking water. This unexpected turn of events left him feeling quite peculiar and bloated.|"['1. What did Fatty Coon scavenge for?\nA) Berries\nB) Potato peelings\nC) Grass\nD) Flowers\nE) Rocks', '2.
