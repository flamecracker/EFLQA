The curtain rose once more, revealing the captivating Lascar, known for his daring nature. Despite his reputation, he showed a gentle side towards the Lass, who seemed uninterested.

Nobody knew the precise date of year one until after it had arrived. They likely did not start counting right away, let alone know five hundred and thirty-seven years prior!
