Carson faced two challenging tasks: he had to move faster than the thieves while keeping his pursuit secret. His knowledge of the land and skills in woodcraft were crucial. Instead of following footprints, he used reasoning to predict where the criminals were headed. By taking shortcuts, he often intercepted them unexpectedly. Carson quickly deduced the thieves were heading to the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Despite their direct path, he trailed them. The thieves, not concealing their tracks, galloped towards the Sierras. Mistakenly feeling secure, they killed horses for a feast. Suddenly, Carson and his men surprised them, reclaiming the stolen horses and defeating the thieves.

The employer managed to gather the intoxicated men and move them out of the area, utilizing the chaos to their advantage. They rode hard, catching up with Carson and his group that same night, putting an end to the danger.

Most of the men had settled down to sleep, but Kit stayed awake by the fire. Suddenly, he heard a strange noise. It sounded like faraway thunder, but Kit knew better. He listened closely and figured out where the sound was coming from, but he couldn't tell what was causing it. Kit pressed his ear to the ground and heard the sound more clearly. It was the sound of many hooves galloping. Carson and his men quietly went out and saw warriors with a herd of over a hundred horses. The warriors had raided Mexican settlements and were heading back with their loot. Carson and his group couldn't resist and scared off the thieves, who left their horses behind. The trappers took some horses, killed a few for food, and let the rest go. They continued their journey, trading with white men near the copper mines. After selling their furs for a good sum, they partied hard, but Kit Carson learned his lesson early and avoided falling into bad habits. He later joined another trapping expedition, led by an experienced mountaineer, trapping along the Rocky Mountains. They faced dangers, hunted for game, and gathered furs until the end of the season. Kit and his friends then went to meet Captain Gaunt, a seasoned mountaineer, and hunted together for months before winter forced them to take shelter.|"['1.

The harsh winter hit hard, with deep snow forcing the trappers to feed their animals with cottonwood bark. Luckily, they had bison meat and games to pass time. But trouble brewed when Crow Indians stole their best horses. Tracking them through the snow was tough, but the trappers persisted. Finally, they found the thieves celebrating. With caution, the trappers waited for nightfall to surprise the Indians. Cold and patient, they observed the thieves enjoying their victory.

During the cold weather, the trappers faced hardship and danger. Kit Carson and his companions, seasoned by exposure, endured the freezing temperatures silently. They cautiously retrieved their horses without alerting the nearby Crows. After a successful mission, a debate ensued among the trappers about their next move.

About fifty years ago, the vast area beyond the Rocky Mountains was largely unexplored. The general features were known, but the interior was like the central parts of Australia or Africa. Clarke and Lewis went on a famous journey to Oregon in the early 1800s, drawing attention to the region. Since then, its growth has been remarkable. The hunters and trappers were a class of people who fearlessly ventured into the wildest parts of the far West and Northwest. The employees of the Hudson Bay Company and the trappers of the American Fur Company often clashed in these territories. While the trappers in British America faced little danger from the native people, those in American territories encountered fierce Indian tribes. Kit Carson, a famous trapper, once pursued deserters who stole furs but was unable to find them, suspecting they fell victim to Indians. Carson and his companion decided to stay in their camp, fortifying it against potential attacks, remaining vigilant throughout their stay.|"[""**1.

The beaver is known for its valuable fur and unique instinct. They live in groups near water sources like rivers, creeks, or lakes. The beavers' dams are expertly built with stones, mud, and tree branches to ensure a steady water supply throughout the year. These dams are wide and sturdy, made by laying logs horizontally and securing them with mud and stones. Beaver lodges are circular structures made of mud, moss, and branches, with thick walls and a smooth mud roof. The beavers gnaw trees in summer, storing the bark for winter food. Their castoreum scent attracts them and is used by trappers to catch them. Kit Carson and his companions set out on a mission to find beavers, sticking to streams to avoid conflicts with mountain Indians.|"['1.

Few trappers ventured deep into the mountains where beavers were plentiful. Carson was sure of finding many. The fur animals seemed to overrun the land, while Indians seemed unaware of the visitors. The trappers quickly gathered a large supply. The Indians could capture their valuable furs, but luck was on their side. They reached Taos safely and sold their pelts at high prices. Despite advice, Kit's friend spent all his earnings. Carson, wise from past experiences, saved for the future. In Taos, Carson met Captain Lee and joined his supply company. They journeyed northward, following the Old Spanish Trail. They encountered hunters at Winty River and settled for winter. When horses were stolen, Carson, respected by both whites and Indians, embarked on a mission to recover them. His skill and reputation helped him recruit a brave warrior for the hunt.

On that day, the area was teeming with beavers. Even though summer wasn't the best time for their fur, the group trapped along the stream until the cold weather began. They were more successful than if they had stayed with the main group of trappers. However, they didn't want to spend winter alone in the mountains. Gathering their supplies, they headed back to their old companions. One day, Carson, leaving his horse with his friends, went hunting on foot for their evening meal. While stalking some elk, Carson suddenly faced two huge grizzly bears charging at him. Unable to reload his gun, Carson had to run for his life towards a clump of trees. The bears were close behind him, but Carson managed to leap onto a tree and fend them off with a makeshift club.

Carson faced a dilemma: would the club or the grizzly bears endure longer? Seeking safety, he climbed the highest branch, wedging himself tightly. The bears, however, were relentless, ascending the tree with determination. The hunter, aware of the bears' sensitive noses, struck them hard, causing them pain. Yet, their fury only intensified, craving to harm the defiant figure. The bears persisted, but Carson, resolute, fought back fiercely. The bears, forced to retreat briefly, regrouped. After a final confrontation, Carson's club deterred them, forcing a retreat. Carson, relieved, descended cautiously, reloaded his rifle, and headed back to camp in the dark. Unfazed by his absence, his companions knew he could handle any danger. The trappers, having breakfasted on beaver, awaited the main group's arrival. Carson, joining a party to trap near the Missouri, faced challenges with the Blackfeet tribe, known for their aggression.

One night, under a dark sky, a group of warriors sneaked into the camp and stole around twenty prized horses.

Carson promptly followed the trail in the snow, leading to a confrontation with the Blackfeet tribe fifty miles away. After some skirmishes and negotiations, a parley was requested.

Carson triumphed, and after roasting the bison, the trappers savored a scrumptious feast. Filled to satisfaction, they believed the meal justified their earlier hardships. Restored, they continued to Fort Hall, where they were warmly greeted and replenished. Soon rejuvenated, they eagerly embraced new adventures. The bison, often called buffalo, provided nourishing meat, with the hump, tongue, and marrow bones being prized delicacies. The hide served various purposes, from robes to shields. Despite mass killings, bison herds still thrive in the west. Some hunting methods, like stampeding off cliffs, are cruel. Bison enjoy wallowing in mud for insect protection.

One day, friendly Crow Indians revealed that the Blackfeet tribe was battling a severe smallpox outbreak, with hundreds and thousands succumbing to the disease. The situation was dire, and there were fears that the entire tribe might perish. The trappers, accompanied by the Crow Indians, sought refuge in a secluded valley for the winter. They constructed sturdy lodges and endured the harsh winter by maintaining large fires. However, their livestock faced challenges finding food, surviving on cottonwood bark. The severe cold led to wild animals, like bisons, becoming aggressive towards the trappers' stock, necessitating constant vigilance and fires for protection. Despite these hardships, the trappers and Crow Indians found solace in friendly competition and camaraderie, enjoying good health, ample food, and comfortable shelter.

In the past, Kit Carson engaged in a significant battle with the Blackfeet while trapping in the Black Hills. The fight involved hundreds of fighters and left a lasting impression on the aggressive Native Americans. After the confrontation, the trappers continued their trapping activities without much interference from the Blackfeet, who feared provoking the skilled marksmen. Carson and his companions gathered a large amount of furs and traveled to a trading post called Brown's Hole. Carson then served as a hunter, ensuring the fort had enough meat. His exceptional skills and dedication to the task earned him praise. Carson's reputation as a skilled leader spread, and he continued to be sought after for his expertise in the west and southwest regions.|"['1.

The Blackfeet, known for their bravery, initially held their ground against a superior force but eventually retreated to a small island on the Yellowstone River. The attackers camped nearby, eager for the assault at dawn. To the trappers' surprise, the Blackfeet had silently withdrawn during the night. The trappers recognized this as a strategic move, anticipating retaliation. The trappers prepared for a possible attack by barricading themselves and stationing sentinels. When the Blackfeet approached, the trappers reinforced their defenses. The Blackfeet, in their war regalia, performed a fearsome war dance. The next day promised a fierce battle. The odds seemed stacked against the trappers facing the vast Blackfoot warriors. Ultimately, the trappers decided to withdraw, marking the end of their trapping endeavors.|"['1.

After a thorough assessment of the task ahead, they realized it was too challenging to complete. Consequently, the impressive group began to retreat. This left the trappers feeling let down. They had not anticipated this turn of events and were furious. They yelled and made provocative gestures towards the Blackfeet, hoping to provoke them to stand their ground, but the Blackfeet were too wise to engage. They fell back to a secure location where they held a war council. After such a sudden withdrawal, it seemed unlikely they would gather enough courage to launch an attack. Following the council, the Indian army split into two groups, with one heading back to their village and the other toward the Crow country. Uncertain if the Blackfeet would return to surprise them, the trappers remained vigilant day and night. Despite some reconnaissance by the Red men, they decided it would be unwise to attack the mountaineers who held their ground and continued trapping throughout the winter.|"[""1.

The deal had a big impact on Kit Carson's future. It was proof that trapping was no longer profitable. Demand for furs had dropped in Europe and America, and beavers were becoming scarce. Carson, a skilled trapper, joined Bent's Fort as a hunter. He kept the fort supplied with game for eight years, showing his expertise by providing deer, antelope, elk, and bison. Carson's incredible service was marked by his exceptional marksmanship, wilderness knowledge, and dedication. Despite the dangers of his work, Carson's respect and skill earned him admiration from Native American tribes. Later, Carson visited his childhood home in Missouri, where he found much had changed. After a brief visit to St. Louis, Carson longed for the West and joined Lieutenant John C. Fremont's expedition as a guide, showcasing his expertise and earning a monthly salary.|"[""1.

A group of explorers gathered in St. Louis for a journey led by Fremont in 1842. The team consisted of Creole and Canadian voyageurs, a German named Charles Preuss, Colonel Benton's son, and a skilled mountaineer named Maxwell. They were well-equipped with arms, horses, carts for supplies, spare horses, and oxen. The expedition began along the Kansas River, with a routine of early starts, breaks at noon, and evening camp setup. An Indian guide led them initially, later taken over by Carson. The fertile land they passed made them contemplate the potential for farming. Challenges arose early, with horses running off, men getting lost, and tents leaking in the rain. Despite setbacks, the explorers remained resilient and continued their journey westward.|['1.

Fremont had a rubber boat, 20 feet long and 5 feet wide, which he used to transport carts and baggage. Unfortunately, due to the nervous helmsman, the boat capsized, causing a loss of precious cargo. The hunters made frantic efforts to save their supplies, with some risking their lives to do so. Despite the mishap, most goods were recovered, but sugar dissolved, and all the coffee was lost. Carson and another member fell ill from their strenuous water rescue efforts. The journey continued westward without major incidents, passing by emigrants on their way to Oregon. In the Pawnee country, they encountered abundant game but had to be vigilant against horse thieves. Fremont's party had a false alarm with supposed Indians turning out to be elk. They later encountered a group of ragged trappers heading back to St. Louis after a failed expedition.|"['1.

On the first of July, as we rode across a beautiful prairie on the river's right bank, a large herd of buffaloes, about a thousand in number, emerged from the water. They leisurely crossed the plain, grazing as they moved. The hunters, including Carson, Fremont, and Maxwell, seized the chance to charge before the buffaloes scattered among the hills. Swift horses were readied, and the hunters swiftly approached the herd. The buffaloes only noticed the hunters when they were within 300 yards. This caused a commotion among the animals, leading to a rapid escape. The hunters pursued on horseback, with the bulls protecting the females. Fremont described the thrilling chase, where they weaved through the herd, each selecting their target. It was an exhilarating and risky pursuit, leading them into a prairie dog village, adding to the excitement of the chase.|['1.

After a successful buffalo hunt, the group traveled over twenty miles across the prairie and camped by a stream, enjoying a feast of bison steaks. While cooking, wolves lurked nearby, drawn by the smell of food. The explorers split up, with Fremont and nine men heading south to St. Vrain's fort for supplies. They encountered a large herd of bisons and later a friendly group of mounted Indians. The journey continued through storms until they reached St. Vrain's Fort, where they secured horses and mules. Moving on to Fort Laramie, they were warned of Sioux unrest but pressed forward, reaching the Rocky Mountains. Despite looming danger, they avoided conflict and arrived safely at Fort Laramie.

We were now entering a region that had a strange and extraordinary interest for us. We were on the waters of a famous lake, a significant feature of the country's geography. The trappers' tales had shrouded the lake in mystery, leaving room for our imagination to roam until we could explore it ourselves. Conversations with old hunters who had visited the region fueled our curiosity. The lake had only been seen by trappers in search of beaver streams, and its islands remained unexplored. Some believed in a whirlpool on the lake's surface leading to the ocean through underground channels. As we reached the Beer Springs, the effervescing gas and acid taste intrigued us. The region was full of interesting sights, like the Steamboat Spring, with its water jet and hot air blasts. The lake finally came into view, stretching far beyond our sight, a magnificent sight that filled us with enthusiasm akin to Balboa's discovery of the Pacific Ocean.|"['1.

Meanwhile, Badau, Derosier, and Jacob stayed behind to tend to the camp. The weather was perfect, with a stunning sunset painting the sky. As the summer evening unfolded, we enjoyed a pleasant night with frogs singing around us. Excited and slightly nervous, we speculated about the untamed islands we would encounter, filled with wildlife and mystery. Our boat, hastily assembled, raised concerns about its durability.

We set sail towards a lower island instead of the mountainous ones, with its summit resembling a crater. As we paddled, the water deepened, making us uneasy in our fragile boat. The lake, though calm, had a noticeable swell and foam patches drifting southward, hinting at a current. The water turned crystal clear, a stunning green, leaving salt crusts on us. Carson spotted whitening waves, forewarning a breeze. Despite a slow journey, we reached an island with salt-covered cliffs. Climbing its peak revealed a breathtaking view of the lake and rugged mountains. Reluctantly, we halted our exploration, content with our discoveries, leaving behind a spyglass cover. Our night on the island, surrounded by roaring waves, was both eerie and fascinating. The next morning, battling strong winds, we departed, collecting water for salt-making.|['1.

"Title: Fremont's Perilous Journey

In their quest for exploration, Fremont and his party faced numerous challenges. Stranded without provisions, they suffered for food until a stroke of luck brought them an antelope to feast upon. Eventually, Fitzpatrick arrived with much-needed supplies, allowing the united group to continue their journey. Pushing forward, they encountered the snow-covered Sierra Nevada Mountains, presenting a daunting obstacle. Undeterred, they crafted snowshoes and prepared to traverse the treacherous terrain. Kit Carson's familiarity with the land provided hope as they glimpsed the Sacramento Valley in the distance. Despite the hardships, the group's determination and resilience propelled them towards their goal of reaching California."|['1.

Fremont and his group's journey through the Sierra Nevada Mountains stands out as an exceptional feat in American history. Carson played a crucial role in this expedition, with Fremont's captivating narrative shedding light on the challenges they faced. As the snow accumulated rapidly, a team of ten individuals on sturdy horses had to forge a path. Each member took turns breaking the trail either on foot or horseback until exhaustion set in. The camp struggled to ascend the hill, only the strongest horses managing the climb. The night was bitterly cold, but they found solace around a large fire under a massive pine tree. Despite the hardships, they pressed on, crafting sledges and snowshoes for the journey ahead. Carson's recognition of a familiar mountain range in the distance brought a sense of relief and accomplishment to the weary travelers.|"['1.

Late in the day, as we headed back to camp, the temperature dropped rapidly with the approaching night. One man grew weary, his feet starting to freeze. Mr. Fitzpatrick stayed with him, building a fire in an old cedar trunk to dry his clothes. After a 20-mile trek, we straggled into camp at nightfall, most of us exhausted, only two having experience with snowshoes. Our focus turned to getting our animals across the snow. The trail was expected to harden after all the baggage was drawn over it. We found grassy spots along the way to rest the animals. Despite the snow's general depth of five feet, we encountered areas as deep as twenty feet. We split into groups to clear a path and work on the road. On February 20, 1844, we reached the summit of the pass, 1,000 miles from the Dalles of the Columbia. The next day, we prepared for the descent, hopeful as we gazed at the valley below.|['1.

We faced challenging labor as we encountered heavy snow near timbered areas. Climbing a height, we planned our route for the next day, relieved to see the mountain slope down rapidly. The day was April-like, with gusts and occasional snowflakes. Clouds veiled the upper mountains by afternoon, hinting at a possible snowstorm. Thunder rumbled, and a thunderstorm enveloped the valley. We marveled at the sight, hoping for good weather. Descending, we reached a river, where Carson leaped across, but I slipped into the icy water. After a cold bath, we dried by a fire before rejoining the camp. Progressing down the mountain, we found grass and oak trees, a welcome change from the snow-covered terrain. The journey was eventful, with lost horses and a rescue mission for a beloved steed.|['1.

We grew concerned about Derosier's disappearance, fearing he was lost in the woods. Charles Towns, still not fully recovered, went to swim in the river, mistaking it for a calm summer stream. Luckily, Derosier returned in the evening, but his mind was troubled. He believed he had been gone for days and thought we were still at the previous camp. We were saddened to see his confusion. Derosier had been lost in the mountains, driven to madness by hunger, fatigue, and the fear of perishing. Despite the harsh conditions and the loss of animals, there was no complaining. Meanwhile, Mr. Preuss had also gone missing down the river. We followed his trail, shouting and firing guns to find him. The landscape improved as we moved away from the river, with oak trees becoming more prominent. We encountered an area with old huts and acorn hulls, indicating human presence. We shouted for Mr. Preuss again and finally heard a response, but it abruptly stopped. Worried about his safety, we split up to search for him, with one man promised a pair of pistols as a token of gratitude for finding him. Fremont and his team spent a month at Sutter's Fort before starting their journey back to the States. They crossed the Sierra Nevada and Coast Range through a pass and followed the Spanish trail to the Mohave River. Along the way, Carson found himself in a typical adventurous situation.|"[""1.

While camping, two Mexican traders, a man and a boy, shared a heartbreaking tale. They were part of a group from New Mexico, with six left to guard horses while the rest traded. Attacked by 30 Indians, the warriors aimed to steal the horses, shooting arrows. To escape, the man and boy raced the horses toward the Indians, breaking through and fleeing. They later found Fremont's camp, seeking help for their missing friends. Carson and Godey, experienced mountaineers, agreed to assist. They raced 30 miles to a spring where the horses were taken, deciding to pursue the Indians. Leaving the boy behind, they chased the warriors, determined to seek justice. Facing challenges, including a worn-out horse, they pressed on, ready for a fierce conflict with the marauders.|"['1.

They got off their horses and walked on, following the trail by touch when the ground was hard to see. Feeling confident about the direction the red men took, they occasionally bent down, running their hands over the earth to find the distinct trail. Even if they strayed a bit, they managed to get back on track. The chase continued for hours this way, until the trail became fresh, indicating they were near the marauders. Exhausted and cold, they decided to wait till daylight without a fire to avoid detection. When morning came, they warmed up, saddled their horses, and galloped towards the Indians. Spotting the stolen animals, they hid their horses, sneaked among the grazing animals, and surprised the Indians. A quick fight ensued, where Carson shot one Indian and Godey missed but quickly reloaded to take down another. The Indians fled, leaving the mountaineers victorious. Carson and Godey buried the dead, returned the stolen property, and refused any payment for their brave act.|"['1.

After a long journey, the exploration group arrived at Bent's Fort on July 2, 1844. Carson decided to leave and become a farmer after reuniting joyfully with his family in Taos. He was warmly welcomed by hundreds of friends who admired his bravery and character. Carson and Richard Owens, a longtime friend, quickly settled on a good location for farming. However, their plans were interrupted when an express messenger delivered a letter from Captain Fremont. Fremont reminded Carson of his promise to guide his third exploring expedition. Despite the financial sacrifice, Carson honored his commitment. Carson and Owens sold their farms at a loss, bid farewell to their families, and set out to meet Fremont at Bent's Fort. Fremont's third expedition was well-equipped with skilled men like Maxwell and Walker, and they embarked on a journey across the desert towards the Great Salt Lake. Fremont's group split, with Walker leading one party and Fremont leading the other, including Carson and a few others, into uncharted territories.|"[""1.

However, General Castro ordered them to leave immediately. Fremont fortified his position, expecting an attack that never came. After receiving urgent messages from Washington about the war between the U.S. and Mexico, Fremont rescued Lieutenant Gillespie. Carson tried to save a Delaware from a Klamath Indian attack but failed due to an unloaded gun. The assailants fled after a brief skirmish.

The journey was arduous as the horseman departed, leaving the men to navigate through darkness, constantly on the lookout for danger. They had to pause often, lying low to assess the situation. The mountaineer faced a setback as he lost his shoes on the plain. The Lieutenant, in a similar predicament, continued barefoot, enduring the pain of thorns and prickly pears. They avoided well-trodden paths, making their journey longer and more challenging. Despite fatigue and injuries, they pressed on, driven by the urgency to save their comrades. Carson, familiar with the terrain, guided them. Finally, a glimmer of light in the distance signaled their arrival at San Diego, where they sought help from Commodore Stockton. With reinforcements, they rushed to aid General Kearney, facing the Mexican forces at Los Angeles. Fremont's surrender resolved the conflict, and Carson reunited with him after rendering his services to General Kearney.|['1.

Kit Carson, a renowned mountaineer, faced perilous challenges during his journey. Despite losing valuable property in a raft accident, Carson navigated through hostile Indian territories with remarkable skill. Refused a military appointment, Carson remained undeterred, emphasizing his commitment to fulfilling his duty for his country. Faced with the threat of Comanche attacks, Carson devised a new trail, reducing his escort to ten skilled mountaineers. By cleverly evading hostile encounters, he transformed the perilous journey into a pleasurable excursion, brimming with abundant game sightings. Carson's strategic navigation led him safely to Fort Leavenworth, where he continued his mission to Washington. Despite facing further challenges and unsuccessful expeditions against hostile tribes, Carson's exceptional woodcraft, courage, and knowledge of tribal customs made him an indispensable figure in the southwestern frontier.|"['1.

Colonel Beale had to go back when the food was almost gone. They found an Apache village and tried to catch them, but the Apaches were too quick. They caught a couple of chiefs and Colonel Beale talked to them kindly. The Apaches promised to behave and were let go. As soon as they were safe, they were happy, which was typical of them. In winter, Colonel Beale went back to Taos. He heard about Indians with Mexican captives and wanted to save them. He went with soldiers and Carson as a guide.

Carson led the company in pursuit of the Apaches after a brutal attack. The trail was challenging, with the Apaches using cunning tactics to evade capture. Despite the obstacles, Carson's skilled leadership kept the mountaineers on track. Finally, they spotted the Apaches in the distance. Carson urged his companions to charge, but a delay caused chaos. In the ensuing battle, only one Apache was killed, and the woman they were trying to rescue had already been slain. Carson returned home but soon set out again when more attacks occurred.

When the white men and Apaches clashed in a fierce battle within rifle range, the Apaches displayed remarkable horsemanship, firing skillfully from under their steeds' necks. Despite their prowess, the white men, led by Kit Carson, outmaneuvered the Apaches, resulting in the loss of their warriors and the recapture of most animals. Later, a treacherous plot was uncovered involving a man named Fox planning to murder two wealthy travelers. Kit Carson, renowned for his intuition, swiftly organized a group of dragoons and soldiers to intercept Fox's party. The cunning plan succeeded, with Fox arrested before he could carry out the crime.

In the past, when Carson and his companions faced a possible attack by Cheyenne warriors, they took decisive action. Carson sent a swift messenger to seek help from soldiers at his ranche, nearly 300 miles away. The Cheyennes approached but were convinced by Carson's cunning that help was on the way. The attack was averted, thanks to Carson's quick thinking and the messenger's speed. After this event, Carson and his friend Maxwell organized a successful beaver hunt with a group of experienced trappers. The hunt, initially thought to yield few beavers, turned out to be very fruitful due to the animals' rapid increase in numbers. Carson later ventured to California, where he made a substantial profit by selling a large herd of sheep. His journey across the plains had given him a hearty appetite, as seen when he enjoyed a substantial dinner for six in San Francisco.|['1.

Kit Carson's longtime friend, Maxwell, joined him in bustling San Francisco, a city of remarkable growth. As they strolled through the streets, once wild and untamed, they marveled at the transformation. Maxwell suggested a quicker journey home via Los Angeles, but Carson, averse to the sea, opted for the longer mule ride. Maxwell set off early, while Carson arrived later on a mule. Their trek hit a snag near the Gila River due to a severe drought. Carson proposed an alternate route with ample forage. They reached New Mexico's copper mines and encountered a Mormon delegate who revealed Carson's appointment as Indian Agent. Known for his integrity and bravery, Carson embraced the role. When Apache unrest erupted, Carson sought peace through dialogue, showcasing his courage and compassion. His approach stands as a model for officials dealing with Native Americans today.|"['1.

The mission was perilous, and Carson chose to go alone to avoid risking others. Upon reaching the camp, he greeted the leaders and addressed the important matter at hand. The warriors recognized him as a fierce and brave adversary, respected for his honesty and courage. Carson delivered a persuasive speech, urging them to consider the consequences of their hostility towards the whites. Although the warriors seemed willing to agree to his terms, Carson remained cautious, knowing the Apaches' tendency for treachery. As expected, the Apaches soon resumed their attacks, prompting Colonel Cook to lead a campaign against them, with Carson as his guide.

The next morning, the group continued their march, and Carson spotted a trail. They followed it with energy, and a couple of days later, they caught up with the Indians. The Apaches fled without putting up a fight, using the rugged terrain to their advantage. Despite losing most of their horses and loot, they managed to evade the pursuers by splitting up into different paths. The soldiers, determined to punish the Apaches, resumed the chase at dawn, navigating challenging landscapes. The pursuit was eventually called off, and they headed to a nearby Mexican village for rest and supplies. There, they discovered a misunderstanding involving a captured Utah warrior mistaken for an Apache. Carson, with his diplomatic skills, sought to mend relations with the Utah chiefs to prevent any alliance with the Apaches. Despite facing challenges like a sudden snowstorm, the pursuit continued with Major Brooks taking charge of the hunt.|['1.

With little delay, a new path was discovered and an active chase commenced. It was evident that the Native Americans were heading towards Utah, and they were pursued without trouble. However, upon reaching that area, the soldiers encountered numerous trails that crisscrossed so much that individual tracks were indistinguishable. Even the most skilled scouts were unable to identify or follow a specific trail. The situation was frustrating, and after more than two weeks in the field with no progress, the troops had to turn back. Knowing that the Apaches would regroup soon, they patiently waited for another chance to strike effectively. After some time, a new expedition led by Major Carleton of the First Regiment of United States Dragoons was organized. Kit Carson was enlisted as the guide. The group journeyed north about a hundred miles to Fort Massachusetts, where they finalized their plans. The team split up, with Captain Quinn's scouts investigating the west side of the White Mountains, while Major Carleton decided to explore the territory to the east. Captain Quinn and his skilled trackers advanced through the San Luis Valley until they reached the well-known Mosco Pass, a favored route for the Apaches when in trouble. Meanwhile, Kit Carson, accompanying Major Carleton, discovered a trail left by three enemies, which eventually connected to the main path. When Quinn joined them, he also had findings to share, leading to a collective agreement that they were on the right track. The expertise and dedication of the scouts and hunters in tracing|['1.

I rode with a skilled guide named Hack, who taught me the art of tracking. He showed me how to read the tracks left by animals. We came across an Indian pony's track, and Hack revealed details about the horse just from its footprints. He explained how the horse was a stray, hungry, and injured. Another time, we found an Indian track, and Hack deduced that it was an old Yankton who had been out trapping. His expertise allowed him to uncover the story behind each track, like identifying a wolf caught in a trap.

Kit Carson and his scouts eagerly pursued a large group of hostile warriors. After six days, they spotted the Indians camped on a treeless mountain peak. Carson accurately predicted their arrival time to Major Carleton. Despite a fierce battle, the soldiers managed to surprise the Indians at their camp. Carson's exceptional tracking skills impressed everyone. Later, Carson embarked on a dangerous journey through Apache territory to meet with the Utah tribe.

The Governor called for volunteers, and five hundred men quickly responded under Colonel T. T. Fauntleroy. Kit Carson was chosen as the chief guide for the campaign. Despite facing intense cold weather, they launched a successful surprise attack on the enemy's main camp, bringing a temporary peace. General Crook also played a crucial role in maintaining peace with the Apaches. Kit Carson's remarkable skills as an Indian Agent were evident as he traveled thousands of miles, negotiating with hostile tribes and averting conflicts. He even rescued a squaw and her children from certain death by paying their ransom. During the Civil War, Carson raised a regiment to protect settlements in New Mexico and captured 9,000 Navajo prisoners with just 600 men. Despite his heroic efforts, Carson succumbed to an aortic aneurysm in 1868.|"[""1.

Kit Carson became known to the public through Fremont's reports on the exploration of the Great West around 1842-3. In my memoirs, I mention Kit Carson bringing the first overland mail to California in his saddlebags. I met Carson again after the Civil War in 1866 when I was the Lieutenant General of the Military Division of the Missouri. During a visit to Fort Garland, New Mexico, I found Carson, who was the commanding officer of the New Mexico Volunteers. I learned that Carson, who couldn't write and had little education himself, was concerned about his uneducated children. I offered to help by sharing a scholarship I had received with him, allowing two of his boys to attend a Catholic college. Carson was grateful but later passed away, leaving his eldest son, William, in my care. Despite my efforts and financial support, William struggled with his studies and was unable to become a Second Lieutenant in the Ninth United States Cavalry due to educational deficiencies. Ultimately, I advised William to return to his uncle's ranch to assist with cattle and sheep.|"[""1.

"In September 1866, I had the privilege of spending several days with the legendary Kit Carson at Fort Garland, Colorado. General Sherman was also present during this time, and our conversations often extended late into the night, covering a wide range of topics. Kit Carson, a Brevet Brigadier General at the time, commanded Fort Garland and the surrounding Indian territories. The fort itself was a typical frontier post made of log huts, where Kit lived with his Mexican wife and their children.

Kit Carson, then around fifty years old, defied my expectations of a weather-beaten, reticent man. Instead, I encountered a medium-sized, talkative individual with a full, florid face. Despite his unassuming appearance, closer observation revealed his remarkable intelligence, courage, and kindliness. His gentle manners, soft voice, and genuine kindness set him apart as a true gentleman. Kit's integrity and conscientious nature shone through in every conversation, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to moral principles and the well-being of others."|"['1.

Kit Carson, a remarkable frontiersman and Indian agent, led a life filled with extraordinary adventures. Born in Kentucky, he grew up exploring the plains and mountains, eventually becoming a skilled trapper. His expertise as an Indian scout and guide was invaluable to explorers like Fremont, although Fremont once ignored Kit's advice and faced disastrous consequences. During the Civil War, Kit served as a Union soldier, raising the First Regiment of New Mexico Volunteers and achieving notable success in campaigns against hostile Indians. Kit's deep understanding of Indian life and character led him to advocate for their rights, blaming white men for inciting Indian conflicts. He strongly condemned the brutal treatment of Indians and criticized the atrocities committed by figures like Col. Chivington, particularly the Sand Creek massacre of 1864. Kit Carson's legacy as a fearless frontiersman and compassionate advocate for Native Americans endures to this day.|"[""1.
