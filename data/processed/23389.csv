"In the mid-1800s, Ballantyne penned several books for Nelson, the publishers, including one around 1858. While not his best work, it served as a ""pot-boiler,"" unlike his usual thrilling tales for teenagers. The book contained excerpts from the Times correspondent, possibly from the New York Times. It also featured letters between the Governor of a British colony and the British Government, highlighting the challenges of communication across North America and the Atlantic. Discovered in the Early Canadiana Online collection, the book was scanned using ABBYY's screen grabbing tool. The text was edited with Athelstane programs. The narrative delves into the colonization issues in the north-western part of British America and the gold rush in the west. The rush for gold, akin to the medieval crusades, drew people from various nations seeking wealth, shaping territories and populations."|"['1.

A look at the map reveals that a significant portion of British Oregon is watered by the Upper Columbia River and its tributary, the McGillivray or Flat Bow River, covering an estimated 20,000 square miles. The Bishop of Oregon, De Smet, described the Kootonais Indians' territory as a mix of forests and prairies, boasting birch, pine, cedar, cypress, coal, and lead mixed with silver. The source of the Columbia River was deemed crucial, with a delightful climate and rare extremes of heat and cold. Bishop De Smet believed the area could become a terrestrial paradise. The valleys of the Peace and Athabasca Rivers, located at the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, share a Pacific climate due to the winds from the Pacific reaching the region through mountain passes. The fertile land with abundant vegetation and wildlife was compared to the lush interior of Africa by Dr. Richard King. The Saskatchewan district, northwest of Minnesota, is rich in limestone, indicating fertile soil and potential for rapid colonization. Despite concerns about the climate, comparisons show that areas like Pembina in North America have similar climates to cities like Moscow in Europe.|['1.

The climate in the Saskatchewan district, much like European Russia, experiences extreme temperature fluctuations. The growth of cereals and vegetables depends more on the intensity and duration of summer heat rather than the severity of winter cold. For example, the northern shore of Lake Huron has a summer heat similar to Bordeaux, France, while Cumberland House on the Saskatchewan surpasses Brussels and Paris in summer heat. The United States Army Meteorological Register shows that the line of 70 degrees mean summer heat crosses the Hudson River and extends westward through various cities. Despite the favorable climate for agriculture in some regions, many areas like Athabasca and Saskatchewan are currently inaccessible to markets due to the presence of warlike indigenous populations.

Between Broughton's Archipelago and Cape Caution lies Mount Stephen, a mountain that stands out for its unique shape and height, guarding the northern entrance to the straits. The coast from Cape Caution to the Russian territory at latitude 54 degrees 40 minutes shares similarities with the area between the Gulf of Georgia and the sea. The harsh features of the coast are softened at times, with more navigable waters. The land is covered in trees and cut by deep canals, forming island archipelagos. The coast is home to various Indian tribes, each with its own distinct habits and territories. The region's beauty and navigability have been praised, making it a favored spot for traders and explorers.|['1.

Cook describes the houses and daily life of the indigenous people. Their homes were built with split boards, spacious enough for multiple families. Inside, small pens were used by each family. The houses had benches, boxes, and carved utensils like pipes. Giant human faces were carved on large tree trunks set up as posts. Despite being filthy, lazy, and having a principal diet of fish, they were skilled in the arts. They made clothes from pine bark, beat fine, and wove them tightly with intricate designs. The people had canoes without sails, used harpoons for fishing, and were adept at catching fish in nets. They also hunted sturgeon and whales. Their burial practices were unique, with corpses placed in canoes or upright boxes. Mount Coffin was a significant burial site. The cemetery was destroyed by a fire caused by American sailors, leading to a conflict with the natives.|"[""1.

After a baby is born, it is placed in a long wooden crib with moss as a pillow. The end where the head rests is elevated higher than the rest. A cushion is then put on the baby's forehead with a piece of cedar bark over it, secured by cords passing through holes on each side of the crib. The process of applying pressure to the head is gradual and believed to be not very painful. The appearance of the baby while undergoing this practice is described as alarming, with bulging eyes and contorted facial features. This tradition among indigenous tribes is a way to signify free birth. The Indians living on the north coast have harsher dispositions compared to those in the south, who are known for their cheerful nature. The southern tribes display mechanical skill in crafting pipes and working with iron and steel. The Indians from the plains have a diet consisting of fish, venison, and roots, and they live in movable tents. The Shoshones and Walla-walla are prominent tribes engaged in ongoing conflicts with the Blackfeet. The equestrian tribes, like the Flat-heads, display intelligence and adaptability to civilization. Their attire consists of deer-skin shirts, leggings, and moccasins, often embellished with beads. Through intermarriage and influence from the Hudson's Bay Company, these tribes are gradually blending into a peaceful society. The more northern tribes near the Oregon River show similarities to the Chippewayan tribes in terms of origin and lifestyle.|"[""1.

The Native Americans have a unique way of catching salmon. They construct a weir across the river with only one opening where they place a basket resembling an eel trap. The fish can enter the basket through this opening. Attached to the basket is a smaller one where the fish are caught and cannot escape. Once the smaller basket is full, it is lifted without disturbing the larger one. The Indian religious beliefs involve polytheism and conjurers as priests. However, with the influence of scientific medicine and missionaries, their authority is diminishing. The discovery of gold in New Caledonia coincides with the laying of the Atlantic telegraph, symbolizing friendly communication and progress. The British government is informed of the gold findings in the Upper Columbia by Mr. Angus McDonald, indicating potential valuable deposits. The British authorities are considering the implications and challenges of taxing gold diggers in the region.|['1.

Gold has been discovered in substantial amounts in the country, with reports of individuals amassing wealth through their efforts. About 220 ounces of gold dust have been brought from the Upper Columbia to Vancouver's Island, indicating the presence of gold in the region. Experiments in washing gold from the tributary streams of Fraser River have been successful, hinting at extensive gold deposits. The geological formations in this area resemble those in the gold-rich Sierra Nevada of California, suggesting the potential for significant gold discoveries. Governor James Douglas promises to provide regular updates on the developments in the gold district. The indigenous tribes in the region have opposed gold exploration by expelling unauthorized prospectors, leading to concerns of potential conflicts. The Hudson's Bay Company has been instructed to respect the natives' wishes and not engage in gold mining without their consent. Governor Douglas highlights the need for protecting the natives and maintaining peace in the region amidst the growing interest in the gold fields.|"[""1.

When mining becomes a profitable job and there's proof of abundant gold deposits, I suggest gradually increasing the license fee. This increase shouldn't be burdensome for miners. My authority to make this decision may be questioned since the areas in question are not under our direct control. However, I hope my intentions and the authority granted by the Hudson's Bay Company will justify my actions. If Her Majesty's Government agrees, I'm willing to visit the Couteau Mines next spring or summer to assess the situation.

"I have important news to share with you. A proclamation was made by me, stating that the Crown holds rights to all gold in its natural deposits. It prohibits anyone from digging for gold without a license. Despite this, around seventy to eighty adventurers from the U.S. have traveled to the Couteau mines via Fraser River without obtaining licenses. I refrained from enforcing these rights without approval from Her Majesty's Government. Once I receive instructions, I will act accordingly. The Couteau gold mines are gaining immense attention from people in Washington and Oregon territories. The area is believed to be rich in minerals, akin to California or Australia. The influx of miners is causing excitement, with reports of intense activity in San Francisco. Boats and canoes are ferrying individuals to Fraser River, with accidents occurring due to dangerous rapids. The American steamer ""Commodore"" arrived with gold miners, mainly from San Francisco, some of whom are British subjects.

In the mid-1800s, the rush for gold in the western territories of North America was a phenomenon that attracted hundreds of people seeking their fortune. The excitement was particularly high in Washington, Oregon, and California, where interested parties fueled the frenzy. Many Americans crossed over to the newly reported gold regions, with steamers and sailing vessels chartered to transport them. Despite reports of ship crews deserting for the gold fields, some crews remained steadfast. The British government, acknowledging the gold rush, planned to establish order and government in the area. They emphasized the importance of maintaining law and order while welcoming foreigners to the gold fields as long as they respected local rules. The Hudson's Bay Company also had rights in the region, and possessory rights of British subjects were to be respected. The treaty also outlined the navigation rights along the Columbia River for British subjects and the Hudson's Bay Company.|"['1.

In 1858, a proclamation was issued in Victoria, warning against unauthorized trade on Fraser River. The Hudson's Bay Company had exclusive trading rights in the region. Vessels without proper licenses faced seizure and forfeiture. Miners from Australia were expected to emigrate due to water scarcity and land acquisition difficulties. In the new gold country, water was abundant, attracting miners. In Australia, miners struggled due to water shortages and land ownership issues. Many miners in California transitioned to farming after earning money from mining. The hope was for reasonable land prices in the new gold country. Prices for goods were high along the river due to transportation challenges. Provisions were costly, with flour priced at 100 dollars a barrel, significantly higher than in San Francisco.|"[""1.

At Fort Langley, there was an abundance of black flour priced at 9 dollars per hundred, and salt salmon, where you could get four for 1 dollar. Imagine the sailors facing scurvy with these provisions! The extravagance peaked when miners needed to buy tools for their work. At Sailor's Bar, rocker irons were sold for an ounce of gold each (16 dollars), and at Hill's Bar, they cost 30 dollars each. These irons are thin sheet-iron plates with holes to sift dirt. In San Francisco, one costs 2.5 dollars, but in England, it would be valued at 2 shillings. The challenges miners face in New Caledonia include high prices for essentials like quicksilver and nails. Despite the difficulties, the arrival of small steamers on the river will ease access to the mines. However, the growing tensions with the Indians might require military intervention. The miners' prices for goods will soon be regulated by competition from San Francisco, providing relief from exorbitant rates.|"['1.
