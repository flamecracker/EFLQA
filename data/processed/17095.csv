Mr. Brown speculated that either Dix took Sue's Teddy bear out to play tag, or the bear fell out on its own. Despite Bunny calling and whistling for Dix, there was no response.

Sue and her family were stuck in their big auto during a storm. Mr. Brown was worried about the risk of fire if they lit the stove. He decided to open the back door to check the flood outside. Sue suggested using her Teddy bear with bright eyes as a lantern. The family used the bear's eyes to see in the dark storm. Mr. Brown and Uncle Tad went out to anchor the car to prevent it from being swept away by the flood. They were in a hurry to secure the auto before it reached the nearby river.

Around them flowed swift water. The night before, Mr. Brown had spotted a small stream near their campsite. Despite the storm, no one expected it to turn into a river. Bunny Brown, known for his courage in previous adventures, wasn't fazed. Heavy rain had turned the small brooks into a massive stream, pushing their car. Mr. Brown decided to anchor the car to a tree to prevent tipping or sliding. Uncle Tad fetched a strong towrope from a locker in case they needed to pull the car from a ditch. Mr. Brown expertly secured the rope to a tree, halting the drifting car. The stream's current slowed, allowing them to anchor safely.|"['1.

During a stormy night, Bunny Brown, his sister Sue, and their family found themselves stranded in a flood. Despite the rain and strong winds, the children and dogs slept peacefully. The parents, however, were kept awake by the sound of the rushing water beneath their car. When morning came, they discovered they had moved a mile down the road due to the floodwaters. Mr. Brown decided they should wait for the waters to recede before continuing their journey. Bunny and Sue, familiar with rafts from coastal living, quickly built one to explore the flooded area.

"The raft drifted from the mud hill in the meadow lake as Bunny and Sue guided it towards the road. Their mother, seeing their wet clothes, refrained from scolding them too harshly, understanding that some accidents are unavoidable. A few days later, when the flood receded and the roads dried, Mr. Brown embarked on a family trip in their large vehicle. During a stop under an oak tree, Uncle Tad demonstrated extinguishers by putting out a fire, while Bunny and Sue roasted marshmallows. They later rushed to help put out a fire at a nearby farm where a pig-pen was ablaze. With teamwork and the use of extinguishers, they successfully extinguished the fire. The next morning, children from the neighborhood came to admire the Browns' newly cleaned and painted car, known affectionately as the ""Ark.""

The man agreed to help and drove back to the farm, leaving Bunny Brown and his sister Sue to continue their adventure. Mr. Brown mentioned their journey to find Fred might take a while as they were traveling slowly. Suddenly, a gray animal caught the attention of the dogs, Dix and Splash, who chased it up a tree. The children ran over to see what was happening, and the dogs were barking excitedly at the animal in the tree. Despite the chaos, Bunny noticed that the gray creature seemed injured. He decided to take it to Uncle Tad for help. The squirrel nestled close to Bunny, seeking comfort. Dix and Splash, though usually not cat chasers, were eager to play with the squirrel.

Bunny and Sue bravely rescued a squirrel from the chasing dogs. Bunny's firm command made the dogs retreat to play tag instead. Bunny explained to Sue that Dix, one of the dogs, recognized the squirrel as a wild animal, not a cat, and that's why he chased it. Uncle Tad examined the injured squirrel, planning to mend its leg with splints and bandages. The squirrel seemed calm and trusting with its new friends. Uncle Tad assured the children that the squirrel would recover soon. They made a cozy home for the squirrel in a box with soft bedding and a wire cover to keep it safe from the dogs. Bunny and Sue fed the squirrel crackers and watched it eat from their hands. The next day, the family continued their journey, stopping near a town to buy food for the squirrel. Later, they heard music and saw a crowd gathered around a wagon in the town square.|"['1.

Mrs. Brown brought old towels for the children to dry their feet after playing near the lake. Bunny and Sue were reminded to ask permission before wading. The family followed a marked path to a beautiful waterfall. Bunny admired the rushing waters but soon wanted to go boating. While at the lake, Sue's teddy bear fell, and she tumbled into the water. Dix, the dog, leaped to her rescue as Uncle Tad prepared to jump in. Dix safely brought Sue back to the boat, with Bunny ready to assist. Uncle Tad commended Dix's bravery, and everyone was relieved that Sue was safe.|"['1.

"Bunny, a boy who grew up by the ocean, understood that ""stern"" meant the back of a boat. His father advised him that if he ever fell out of a boat, he should re-enter from the stern or the bow, not the sides. A row-boat is more stable when boarded from the back or front. It's uncertain if the dog knew the safest way to bring someone back on board. Nevertheless, the dog followed Uncle Tad's instructions and brought Sue back safely. Sue, a good swimmer, held her breath when she fell in the water. Dix, the dog, rescued her quickly. They found Sue's Teddy bear on the lake bottom with its eyes still glowing. Eventually, they all went back to the ""Ark"" after a warm welcome at a nearby farmhouse. Sue was fine after changing into dry clothes."|"[""1.

The kids peeked out of the small windows by their beds and spotted a line of brightly colored circus wagons rolling down the road. Uncle Tad, busy with his fishing gear, explained that these wagons carried the essentials for setting up the circus - tent poles, food, and stoves. The animals and other wagons would follow later. Excited, Sue mentioned the possibility of a parade passing by their spot. Uncle Tad, not initially keen on circuses, teased about taking them. The children, eager and dressed, watched as more circus wagons passed by, including elephants, camels, and horses. They were thrilled by the sight, especially the majestic elephants. Ready for the adventure, Uncle Tad arranged for a ride with Mr. Jason to the circus grounds to catch all the action.|['1.

Bunny and Sue had an exciting day at the circus, watching wild animals in cages and enjoying the performances of clowns and acrobats. They fed popcorn and peanuts to the elephants and shared their thrilling experience with their parents over supper. Later that night, Mr. and Mrs. Brown were awakened by the commotion of circus animals on the loose. They learned that the biggest lion had escaped when its cage broke while being loaded onto a train. The circus crew was trying to capture the lion, offering a reward for its safe return. Despite the excitement, Bunny and Sue were safe at their camp, listening to the distant sounds of the circus under the moonlight.|"['1.

One day, after the circus had packed up, a lion broke loose from its cage, causing a stir. Many people rushed around in panic, but Bunny, a brave boy, hoped to find the lion to earn a reward. Meanwhile, the children, Bunny and Sue, were unaware of the lion's escape as they slept soundly. Their mother, Mrs. Brown, planned to inform them the next day to ensure they stayed safe. The children had to play near the automobile, missing their usual adventures in the fields. Days passed, and the lion remained at large. Mrs. Jason, a farmer's wife, rushed to the Browns for help as her son had been badly scratched by the lion. She sought their aid until the doctor arrived.|"[""1.

"""That's what he says,"" replied the farmer's wife. ""He is certainly badly scratched, as I could see for myself. Whether it was by a lion or something else I can't say, never having seen a lion's scratches. The boy might be making up some story, but he certainly _is_ scratched.""

""Now please don't get excited,"" begged Mr. Brown. ""In the first place this boy may not be telling the truth. He is scratched, for Mrs. Jason has seen the marks and bandaged them up, she says. But it may be the boy fell down in the bushes, or among the rocks and got scratched that way. Or it may have been some other wild animal in the woods that attacked him. There are some animals around here, aren't there?"" he asked the farmer's wife.

""Well, skunks, groundhogs and the like of that, with maybe a fox or two. Of course foxes or groundhogs will bite if any one tries to catch them, but I don't know that they'd scratch, though they might if they were put to it. I never saw such scratches as these. And, as you say, Mrs. Brown, it _may_ have been the circus lion which is hiding around here.""

Bunny and Sue were both excited and a little scared as they settled into bed. Uncle Tad promised to stay up all night, just like he did as a sentry in the war, watching for any signs of the lion. The next morning, the children were up early, eager for news about the scratched boy and the captured lion. Mr. Brown ordered the dogs, Dix and Splash, to go back, but Dix ran into the room where the wounded boy was lying and started barking wildly. It turned out that the boy was Fred Ward, who had run away and was found with his dog, Dix. Dr. Fandon arrived and confirmed that Fred was doing better. The lion was safely locked in the henhouse, and the circus folks were called to take him away. Fred explained that he had joined a medicine show to play the banjo he loved, but was relieved to be found.|['1.
