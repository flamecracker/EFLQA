The small cloud grew bigger, and suddenly a strong wind blew, making the sea rough and the waves angry. The ship, sturdy as it was, creaked and groaned, tossed around like a toy boat. The passengers were very scared, realizing the power of a storm at sea. Even the bravest can be scared by the sea's might. It was a frightening night; no one dared go on deck. Harry, calm but pale, contrasted his friend from Brooklyn, who moaned loudly. In the middle of the night, a mast crashed, causing panic below deck. The ship was in a fierce battle with the sea. Harry feared the ship was doomed. As the storm calmed, Harry went on deck, seeing the worn-out sailors and a stern-faced captain preparing to pump water.|"['1.
