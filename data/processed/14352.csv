Farnsworth was concerned about Azalea's potential exposure as a movie star and the impact it might have on her life.

When Van Reypen stopped at the Gales' place to retrieve his pipe, Azalea found herself in a challenging situation with Merritt, who was insistent on taking Fleurette away.

Azalea, clearly irritated, stood with clenched fists and a scowl. ""Invading someone's room without permission is just plain rude! That's not good manners!""

Others chimed in, criticizing Azalea's involvement with a movie company. Farnsworth defended her, determined to uncover the mystery behind her behavior. They discovered Azalea had left early in the morning, possibly to a movie studio.

""You see, Miss Adams came here because she knows Miss Frawley,--we live together--but Miss Frawley is out of town,--and I persuaded Miss Adams to stay with me until her return.

They didn't break the speed laws, as their car flew down to New York, but it was only because that would have meant delay in reaching their goal. About mid-afternoon they arrived at Miss Grayson's apartment and surprised Azalea by entering the room where she sat.
