It was precisely five o'clock in the afternoon when an unexpected visitor arrived at my study in a quaint English town. The visitor, a gentleman of small stature, entered abruptly, leaving his hat on and staring intently at me. Without a word, he positioned a chair in front of me and seated himself, fixing his gaze on my face. Despite his eccentric behavior, I was intrigued rather than alarmed. The visitor, later revealed to be an old friend named Peterkin, shared that he had turned twenty-two the day before and had come with a peculiar proposal. Overwhelmed with joy at the reunion, I embraced Peterkin, astonished by his physical strength. He then disclosed his plans for an extended stay, promising surprises that would astonish me. Despite my initial excitement, I struggled to focus on his rapid and animated speech, which was peppered with interruptions and questions.|"[""1.

My friend suddenly changed from being volatile to caring when he accidentally upset old Agnes. He showed genuine concern as he carefully lifted her and placed her in a chair. Despite her initial fright, Agnes felt comforted by his soothing words. She even insisted on delivering a letter to the post-office, much to his protest. The unexpected turn of events led to a heartwarming moment between them. Later, we anticipated meeting our friend Jack Martin at the coach, but our plans were disrupted when he did not arrive as expected.

"As soon as I started talking with my friend, I heard ""the gorilla"" trying to engage Peterkin in conversation, but it seemed unsuccessful from the sharp replies I overheard. However, after a few minutes, it appeared that the gorilla managed to improve the situation with Peterkin, as their voices grew louder and more lively behind me. Suddenly, a shout caught my attention, and when I turned around, I saw Peterkin in a struggle with the gorilla! Shocked by what I saw and thinking my friend was being attacked, I grabbed the old woman's umbrella as my only weapon and rushed to help. Amidst the chaos, all I could recall were the screams of the old woman shouting about thieves and murder as she fled. We never saw her again, but I made sure to return her umbrella to the ""white house."" As we hurried to my place, Peterkin asked, ""Jack, how did you find us?"" completely forgetting about the old woman. Jack, now a tall and strong man, was amused by Peterkin's plan but eventually agreed, leading to excitement about their upcoming adventure in Africa. One night, weeks after deciding to go on a hunting expedition to Africa, I couldn't help but wonder, ""Are we really here, in the midst of it all?"""|"[""1.

Not willing to banter with my lively friend, I stayed silent, lost in the delightful thoughts brought by the unique scene around me. It felt like just yesterday we were bustling in London for our trip, and now, everything seemed strange, wild, and exotic. We sat by a huge fire in a vast forest with unfamiliar plants and trees. The lush greenery captivated me the most. Towering palms enveloped us, their leaves veiling the starry sky. Creeping vines and plants twisted around, giving the woods a tangled appearance. The fire cast a warm light on the dark surroundings, making the forest look like a painting. Dressed in brown coats and pants, we aimed for a rugged look, while Peterkin smoked and Jack, more composed, joined in. Jack, a powerful figure, moved deliberately but could act swiftly when needed. Our attire included grey trousers and different hats, each reflecting our unique styles. Peterkin's attempt to grow a beard like Jack's didn't quite have the desired effect, but it added a touch of humor to our journey.|"['1.

Peterkin eagerly urged Ralph to continue with their adventurous plans, expressing joy at the prospect of embarking on a wild journey. Despite their excitement, they discussed the practicalities of their upcoming elephant hunt. While basking in the natural beauty of their surroundings, the group was startled by a fierce roar nearby. Jack quickly took charge, reigniting the fire to ward off potential threats. They set up a second fire as a precaution against wild animals and took turns keeping watch throughout the night. Despite their fatigue, Ralph and Jack found it hard to fall asleep, reflecting on the mysteries of sleep and the unusual circumstances of their African bush experience.|['1.

I looked up for a few minutes, thinking I saw a monkey, but it turned out to be an elephant's head. Then, it changed to a hippopotamus. Despite the oddity, I felt indifferent. The creature morphed into various forms like a lion with a crocodile's tail. I became the camp guardian, checking my rifle and adjusting the fires. The forest's darkness felt eerie yet fascinating. As I sat by the fire, I struggled to stay awake, battling sleep. I reminded myself not to doze off on duty. The night was silent, filled with imaginary creatures and real dangers. It was a test to remain vigilant during my watch.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat did the creature morph into after appearing as an elephant's head?\nA) Monkey\nB) Hippopotamus\nC) Lion\nD) Crocodile\nE) Giraffe"", 'Question 2:\nHow did the speaker feel when the creature morphed into various forms?\nA) Excited\nB) Scared\nC) Indifferent\nD) Amused\nE) Anxious', 'Question 3:\nWhat did the speaker become in the story?\nA) A hunter\nB) A chef\nC) A camper\nD) A guard\nE) A scientist', 'Question 4:\nWhat did the speaker do as the camp guardian?\nA) Cooked meals\nB) Played music\nC) Checked rifle and adjusted fires\nD) Explored the forest\nE) Slept', ""Question 5:\nHow did the forest's darkness feel to the speaker?\nA) Warm\nB) Bright\nC) Eerie\nD) Inviting\nE) Noisy"", ""Question 6:\nWhy did the speaker struggle to stay awake by the fire?\nA) To avoid the cold\nB) To watch the stars\nC) To battle sleep\nD) To make s'mores\nE) To go for a walk""]"|['C) Lion', 'C) Indifferent', 'D) A guard', 'C) Checked rifle and adjusted fires', 'C) Eerie', 'C) To battle sleep']
As I pondered these thoughts, I stood up and shook myself awake. I patted my chest, pinched my nose, and sat back down. Shortly after, I felt drowsiness creeping in once more. Startled, I sprang up, tended to the fires, and paced back and forth until fully alert. To avoid a repeat, I peered into the dark forest beyond the light's reach. Suddenly, my knees buckled, jolting me awake just in time. Alarmed, I feared wild beasts attacking if I dozed off. Battling sleep, I recited verses to stay vigilant. A terrifying scream jolted me up, realizing my rifle was missing. Peterkin scolded me, but it turned out to be a prank to teach me a lesson. Grateful for the lesson learned, I vowed never to doze off on guard duty again.|"['1.

We busied ourselves gathering the dying embers of our fire and preparing breakfast with tea, hard biscuit, and cold monkey. Despite the monkey's good taste, it resembled a small roasted baby, making it unappetizing. We had set off hunting, aiming to live off our rifles, but only encountered monkeys. After a merchant ship journey from Liverpool to Africa, we joined a Portuguese trader heading inland to learn the native language and find a guide to reach the gorilla country. The African tribes' trade system hindered direct trading, requiring goods to pass through many tribes before reaching the coast. To avoid trouble, we planned to clarify our intentions with each tribe. Eager to hunt gorillas, we set off from a native village, hoping to add one to our animal collection. After breakfast, we packed up and headed back to the village, with Jack carrying the heaviest load.|"['1.

"""Remember!"" I exclaimed excitedly. The memory of our adventures on Penguin Island flooded back. The days of drinking lemonade from coconuts, exploring coral beaches, and escaping pirates in caves felt like yesterday. As we reminisced, Peterkin reminded us not to dwell on the past. Suddenly, a tree filled with scarlet fruit caught our attention, attracting monkeys and parrots. Peterkin, curious about monkeys, shared a tale from the London Zoo. A monkey's furious reaction to his face-making startled us all. The commotion caused the fruit to rain down, hitting Jack. Soon after, a herd of gazelles dashed by, eluding our rifles. Then, a distant roar signaled approaching danger. We readied our rifles, seeking refuge behind trees, as the ominous sound grew louder."|"['1.

In the dense woods, we heard a wild beast approaching in a state of panic. A buffalo bull charged into view with a leopard clinging to its neck. The bull's frenzied attempts to shake off the leopard were futile. As the bull neared us, we prepared to end its suffering. Jack fired his rifle, causing the bull to stumble. I hesitated, torn between aiming at the bull or the leopard. In the commotion, Peterkin got entangled in thorns, drawing the bull's attention. The bull changed course towards Peterkin, who was trapped and defenseless. Overwhelmed with fear for my friend's safety, I struggled to act, my hands trembling as I tried to reload my rifle. The tension was palpable as the bull charged towards Peterkin, leaving us in a state of shock and helplessness.|"['1.

Jack made no effort to load his weapon, but instead, he let out a fearful cry and leaped towards our companion like an angry tiger. A glimmer of hope filled me as I watched his massive figure charge through the undergrowth. It seemed impossible for any creature to withstand such a fierce attack. Unfortunately for Peterkin, even with Jack's strength and courage, it wouldn't have been enough to save him in time. A higher force guided Jack's actions as he stood his ground and aimed his rifle at the charging bull. The bull was just a stride away from Peterkin when the fatal shot rang out, bringing the beast down at his feet. We were overwhelmed with gratitude towards God for saving our friend and we celebrated his deliverance with hugs and handshakes. It was a challenge to free Peterkin from the tangle, but we managed to do so and examined our kill. We were surprised to find that only three bullets had hit the bull, with two shots in the neck and shoulder being quite far apart. After some discussion, we realized that I had unknowingly shot a leopard nearby, not the bull.|"['1.

A muff is a boy who is mild, diffident, and gentle, but to truly earn the title of a muff, he must also be timid and unenthusiastic. This means being afraid of minor dangers like rain or dogs, avoiding bold activities, and showing reluctance to learn essential skills like swimming. Muffs tend to boast around girls but shrink on the playground. Courage and cowardice are not black and white; they can be developed through training. It's important for muffs to build courage by learning to swim, leap, run, and defend themselves. By facing challenges and practicing bravery, muffs can grow into sensible individuals who are lions in the field when needed. Boasters, on the other hand, are easily recognizable by their loud talk and lack of action, often earning contempt from others. It's crucial to strike a balance between confidence and humility to become respected individuals.|"['1.

Peterkin suddenly screamed and started acting wildly, which startled me. He usually joked around but never behaved like a buffoon. He dashed into the woods, ripping his clothes off. Jack also began to act strangely, roaring like a bull. I realized they were attacked by Bashikouay ants, known for their ferocity. Soon, the ants swarmed me, and we all ran, stripping off our clothes to shake them off. We managed to escape the ants but were left nearly naked. As we cleared the ants off each other, we heard a shout and saw the trader and some locals approaching. We quickly dressed, and the trader teased us about our ordeal. We had hunted a buffalo and a leopard, which impressed the locals.|"['1.

In the African village, a trader explained to a group of eager natives how they valued leopard brains for hunting success. The crowd dispersed excitedly in search of the leopard carcass. The trader emphasized the importance of traders and missionaries working together to bring change to Africa. He expressed his desire for more people to prioritize the salvation of souls over trade. The next morning, preparations for an elephant hunt were underway in King Jambai's village. The simple bamboo huts and bustling activities painted a vivid picture of daily life in the African community. The trader and his companions spent the night in a hut, battling mosquitoes until dawn broke.|"['1.

King Jambai invited us to breakfast, but Princess Oninga was alone, smoking a pipe in the king's chair. She had prepared breakfast for us earlier and now rested. The princess had a unique hairstyle, resembling a cocked hat with a horn. She wore heavy brass rings on her arms and ankles, making her walk awkward. As we were about to comment on her appearance, King Jambai arrived, greeting us by rubbing noses. Breakfast included plantains, nuts, fowl, and pig. After eating, we discussed arranging for an interpreter and porters. The king was willing to help and felt honored by our visit. He was proud to have us as guests and boasted to neighboring chiefs about us. Makarooroo, a hunter who spoke some English, was expected soon. The king prepared canoes for a hunting expedition, cheered by Makarooroo's successful leopard hunt. Makarooroo had some education from a missionary and was respected among his people as a fetishman.|"['1.

In a distant land, the king and queen converted to Christianity, joining children in their daily school lessons. Despite their diligence, the children easily outperformed them, proving that youth is the prime time for learning. Makarooroo, a loyal companion, showed his intellect by speaking English with the trader. Excited to join a hunting trip, he grabbed his old gun and spears. As the group paddled up the river, the lush tropical scenery captivated them. While the sun beat down, they navigated carefully to avoid sunstroke and potential dangers like crocodiles. Bathing in streams kept them healthy, a practice they maintained throughout their journey in Central Africa. Peterkin emphasized the importance of swimming, a skill that had saved lives and brought joy, especially in the face of unexpected challenges.|['1.

"Peterkin exclaimed, ""Bah! Your reception of this grand truth is like how the pig-headed world will react. What's the point of preaching common sense? I'm a perfect donkey!"" ""No, Peterkin,"" Jack replied. ""I understand your point. Your words could revolutionize the juvenile world and turn them into aquatic animals.

As we ventured deeper into the jungle, a surprising encounter with a large bird left us in awe. Instead of fleeing, the bird resumed its fishing nonchalantly. We soon disturbed its peace by landing nearby to proceed on foot through the dense foliage. Armed and cautious, we were on the lookout for elephants that the locals mentioned were close by. The hunters readied their heavy rifles as we cautiously advanced, respecting the natives' methods of hunting. A vast vine wall had been set up to entrap the elephants for a successful hunt. As the natives spread out to drive the game towards us, a sudden roar and a lion's attack caught us off guard. Quick action was required, and despite the danger, we stood our ground, ready to face the challenges of the African jungle.|"[""1.

I was filled with indescribable emotions when I saw the majestic lion for the first time, coupled with the tragic death of a person. My mind was in a whirl of excitement. Soon after firing at the lion, two elephants charged out of the bushes. One was around ten to eleven feet tall, the other at least twelve feet. I had never seen such massive creatures in England's zoos. The sight of these gigantic African monsters was terrifying. The elephants charged through the forest, knocking down everything in their path. The natives attacked them with spears, making the elephants appear like porcupines. The elephants charged at us, but the natives' relentless spear attacks turned them away. The natives were wild with excitement, throwing spears from all directions. The elephants struggled to break free from the vines and the natives' assault. One elephant broke free and charged at King Jambai. Jambai threw his javelin, then fled, followed by the others. The elephant turned towards us, and in a moment of clarity, I stood between Jack and the elephant, ready to protect my friend.|"[""1.

At that moment, I saw Peterkin rush to my side; our guns boomed through the woods. The elephant leaped over Jack and crashed to the ground, toppling a tree. We quickly helped Jack up, but shouts ahead warned us of new danger. Reloading, we hurried forward to find the second elephant menacing King Jambai. The king was perched precariously on a tree, trying to fend off the beast. The elephant, determined, began to break the tree. The natives fought with spears, but the elephant persisted. Finally, the elephant succumbed, and the natives rejoiced. As evening fell, we camped on higher ground. Reflecting on the day's events, Peterkin cautioned about the dangers of shooting at charging elephants. We observed the tusks of the fallen elephant, a valuable find. Despite some losses to white ants, we learned valuable lessons from the day's hunt. The night in camp was filled with fires, stories, and the aroma of cooking elephant and venison steaks, creating a wild and unforgettable atmosphere.|"['1.

The African American has a special fondness for fire. In his warm climate, the nights feel cold to him, and he revels in the warmth of a fire like a cat in the sun. The fire seems to draw out his entire being, making his eyes sparkle with joy. A good meal and a cozy fire make him almost perfectly content. The only thing missing for his complete happiness is a pipe! Under similar circumstances, a white man may also be content, but the African American expresses his happiness more openly, forgetting his worries and enjoying the moment wholeheartedly. As I sat by the fire with my friends, their happy faces, made even brighter by our gift of tobacco, filled me with joy. It was hard to believe that these cheerful men, who seemed so kind and jolly, were the same individuals known for their cruelty and superstitions. The scene felt like a dream, especially after a day filled with hunting imaginary gazelles, lions, and elephants. The next morning, I observed my friend Peterkin's peculiar morning routine, trying to understand his eccentricities. His actions and musings seemed like a mix of reality and dreams, making him a fascinating character to study.|"['1.

"At the height of our adventure, I couldn't hold back any longer and burst into laughter upon realizing that Peterkin had spent the night hunting just like I had. However, our accomplishments were quite different. Peterkin joked about dreaming of bagging fifteen elephants and ten lions, carrying them all on his back without feeling the weight. He even decided to call me ""Mak"" instead of my long name. Soon, Makarooroo, the friendly local, served us a delectable round of meat that we eagerly devoured. After a hearty meal, we, along with the king and his people, prepared to continue our journey towards the gorilla land. During the hunt, I marveled at the daring way the locals loaded their guns with excessive powder and shot. As we returned to the village, we sensed an impending superstitious frenzy that could lead to tragedy. Mak warned us of potential danger, but assured us that white men were respected and safe. We made it clear that we were prepared to defend ourselves if needed."|"[""1.

We were somewhat relieved upon hearing this news. We knew that three men, no matter how prepared, could not defend themselves against a whole tribe of savages. Despite this, we decided to stay alert and ready for any danger. The trader left for the coast, leaving us in the care of King Jambai. We asked him for men to help carry our goods inland. The king tried to dissuade us, warning us of the dangers of the gorilla country. But we were determined to go. Eventually, the king agreed to provide men for us. That night, the village was in turmoil as the tribe's doctor accused certain members of witchcraft. The noise kept us awake.

In a terrifying ritual, those accused of crimes among a tribe must drink poison. If the poison overcomes them, they are brutally killed. A group of witnesses, including the king and a doctor, oversee the ordeal. The ground is littered with the remains of those who did not survive. Two individuals remain, an old man and a young girl, awaiting their fate. The old man succumbs to the poison, and the executioners swiftly end his life. As the young girl, Okandaga, trembles in fear, a heated debate ensues between the tribe's leader and the visiting white men.

Unable to control himself any longer, the man cried out in fear and tried to escape; however, Jack, who always seemed ready for any situation, had anticipated this and quickly caught up to him, wrapping his arms around the man's neck to prevent him from fleeing. Soon, the torches were relit, and they proceeded into the cave. Mak, once he recovered from his fright, grew braver. The cavern was approximately a hundred yards deep and fifty wide, but they couldn't determine its height due to the darkness above. Divided into two chambers, one large and the other small, they made preparations. Peterkin, the first to be ready, created a plan involving powder and water. As they heard a terrifying yell, the group armed themselves and headed towards the native village, leaving their rifles behind to avoid being identified. Upon approaching the village, they heard shouting and hastened their pace, preparing for potential danger.|"[""1.

As we approached the back of the house, we heard voices inside but couldn't see anything. We circled to the front, staying hidden behind bushes. Jack stopped, and we gathered beside him, peeking through the foliage. The hut's front was open, lit by a bright fire where four guards sat with their spears. They chatted excitedly, ignoring Okandaga, who sat behind them, her face covered. Without hesitation, Jack signaled, and we pounced on them. I locked eyes with a guard, my anger rising. I lunged, striking him on the temple. The others fell swiftly. Okandaga, startled at first, found comfort in Makarooroo's arms. We swiftly left, knowing the village was stirring. Running towards our guns, we heard the approaching cries of the pursuers. Okandaga struggled to keep up as we raced towards the cave, with the savages closing in.|"[""1.

In a swift move, Jack grabbed Okandaga and carried her into the cavern as the others halted to face the oncoming pursuers. It was crucial to prevent the men from disclosing their hideout. Jack dashed out to confront the pursuers, who split up in fear. Seeing that Jack couldn't catch both, I swiftly seized one by the hair and dragged him into the cave with Peterkin's help. Meanwhile, Jack effortlessly lifted the other man and brought him inside. The men from the village, led by King Jambai, gathered at the cave's entrance, hesitating to enter due to superstitious fear. The king called for a volunteer to join him in exploring the cavern. The doctor reluctantly stepped up, feeling the pressure of the moment. Outside, as preparations were made to defend themselves, Peterkin devised a daring plan involving gunpowder and a dramatic disguise to ward off the approaching threat.|['1.

Startled by the sudden commotion, the bats swarmed out of their caves, plunging the cavern into darkness. The savages hesitated at the entrance, frozen in fear. Acting quickly, we lit the gunpowder cones, causing a dazzling display of sparks. Peterkin, with a terrifying yell, inadvertently set off a powder explosion, illuminating the cave. His flaming appearance scared both the savages and the bats, creating chaos as they all fled in panic. Peterkin's laughter added to the confusion as the terrified men ran for their lives. Realizing the danger, we devised a plan to send Okandaga and Makarooroo through the woods parallel to our river route, ensuring her safety until we could return for her.

Peterkin suggested that before departing, the guide should explain the day's route using a mix of phrases and signs. While engrossed in conversation, they had forgotten about the prisoners who were tied up nearby. The prisoners managed to free themselves and attempted to escape. One of them was tripped by Jack and fell into a deep hole, meeting a tragic end. The other prisoner almost fled but was swiftly caught and killed by Makarooroo. Despite the necessity of these actions to protect themselves, the group was filled with sorrow over the outcome. They quickly finalized their plans, washed off charcoal to blend in with the surroundings, and left the cave. After a few miles, they stopped for Okandaga to rest while Jack stayed with her. The guide proceeded to give instructions to their men before parting ways. The group then rested for a few hours before continuing their journey.|"[""1.

"Our ability to overcome our inner struggles often hinges on how we approach them. I believe that there is a critical moment each morning when we wake up, a moment ripe with potential for victory if seized. Just like Shakespeare said, ""There is a tide in the affairs of men,"" that perfect instant upon waking is our chance to leap out of bed with determination. Miss that moment, and we risk falling back into a state of lethargy. Peterkin, less contemplative on this matter, decided to hunt a duck instead. As we crept towards the duck, we stumbled upon two elephants. Peterkin took a shot, bringing down one of the elephants. While the locals celebrated, Peterkin regretted missing the duck, noting that elephant meat was not suitable for our palates."|"['1.

After the canoe returned and ferried us across the river, we had breakfast where the elephant had fallen. This allowed the locals to take what they needed from the meat and secure the tusks. We then resumed our journey and camped near a palm grove described by Makarooroo. He and Jack joined us that night, sharing Jack's successful day hunting antelope, spotting a zebra, rhinoceros, and other game. We learned Okandaga was safe nearby. We met Mbango, the chief, who warmly welcomed us, offered food, and invited us to hunt with his people. Despite declining, we promised to return after gorilla hunting. Leaving Okandaga under Mbango's care, we assured her safety. Peterkin impressed them with his marksmanship and convinced them of our extraordinary abilities. Njamie, Mbango's wife, took charge of Okandaga, ensuring her safety. We continued our journey deeper into the wilderness with Makarooroo, leaving the crew unaware of our actions by sending them ahead with the canoe. A week later, an adventure almost cost Jack his life, altering our travel plans.

"Gladly,"" he answered, dropping his heavy load and wiping the sweat off his forehead. ""I was just about to stop when you spoke. How are you faring, Peterkin?"" Peterkin complained, ""I need a break. I spotted a clear spot ahead with a tree. Let's rest there."" We moved our bags to the spot, finding relief from the tall grass. As we relaxed under the tree, I noticed a peculiar insect. Peterkin saw it too. It was an ant-eater, using its tail to catch ants. Peterkin joked, ""That's a unique trapper!""

Our guide shared fascinating insights about the extraordinary speed and behavior of ostriches. He described how these birds can run faster than one can imagine, with legs moving so swiftly that counting them is impossible. Despite their speed, ostriches can make seemingly illogical decisions when feeling threatened, like running towards perceived danger instead of away. The guide recounted a close encounter where an ostrich narrowly avoided being shot due to its lightning-fast movements. The narrator attempted to calculate the bird's speed by measuring the time it took to pass between two bushes, only to be interrupted by a missed shot.

Upon reaching the location, I was amazed by what I saw. The bird had taken huge steps measuring fourteen feet each! I used my yard-measure to confirm - there were exactly thirty of these gigantic paces between two bushes. Calculating the speed, it covered nearly thirty miles in an hour. When Jack didn't return, we grew worried. As the sun set and night approached, we set out to search for him. We shouted periodically, hoping he would hear, but found only a man's footprints in the soft soil. Surprised, we discovered blood and a naked footprint, not matching Jack's.

While I helped my friend with his wounds and adjusted the bandages, my friends cut two poles. We placed them on the ground, parallel and about two feet apart. Then, we laid our three coats across them, securing them roughly with cords I had. We placed our friend on this makeshift stretcher and lifted him onto our shoulders. Peterkin and I carried the rear poles, while Makarooroo supported the other end on his shoulders. Surprisingly, our injured friend endured the journey better than expected. We were fortunate to be near a native village where we decided to take him for recovery. The chief, related to King Jambai, welcomed us warmly.

The stories that the locals have been sharing with me through Mak as a translator have made me doubtful. They claim that a gorilla is so powerful that it can lift a person off the ground with one of its hind feet. They say the gorilla lurks on lower tree branches in dark woods, waiting for prey. When a person passes by, the gorilla uses its hind foot to lift them into the tree and strangle them. They don't mention if the gorilla eats its victims. Jack and I agree that while these tales are incredible, they hint at the existence of such creatures in this wild land. The locals believe that some gorillas house the spirits of deceased individuals and are distinguished by their size and aggression. They are said to be untouchable and have a liking for sugar cane, stealing it boldly from the natives.|['1.

"""We should follow the chief's lead,"" I chuckled, ""or we won't be fit to hunt gorillas later on. But the plan makes sense. Much of our journey is through a desert area, so riding oxen will ease our tired bodies. I think it's worth considering."" ""Right, Ralph,"" agreed Jack. ""Mak, tell the chief or whoever he is, with my thanks, I'll think about it. And give him this tobacco, but don't you dare shrink its size, you rascal."" ""Now, boys, leave me,"" Jack sighed after chatting for an hour. ""I need to prepare my body for what's ahead."" It was still early, so we took our rifles and walked into the woods. ""It feels like we'll never reach the gorilla country,"" Peterkin remarked. ""I'm such a skeptic,"" I replied, ""I need to see things to believe them."" As we walked, we saw a small pool of water under a fig tree, surprising us as it hadn't rained. A drop fell from insects above, known for distilling water. I believed they got moisture from the air.

Jack stated that both the naturalist and the hunter are essential, as they complement each other. The naturalist collects specimens and knowledge, while the hunter provides the naturalist with opportunities. Peterkin attempted to approach a buffalo for a shot, but his rifle malfunctioned.

After losing consciousness, I was confused when I opened my eyes. Peterkin was beside me, examining scratches on his leg. He had tried to revive me with a wet cloth on my forehead. As he tended to his wounds, he muttered about his injuries. I slowly got up, grateful for a bush that broke my fall. We managed to extract the buffalo's tongue, a trophy for the village. We planned to ride oxen when tired but decided to let porters carry our gear. Despite feeling unwell, Peterkin leaped onto an ox, only to be thrown off by a tree branch.|['1.

"""We set off on our journey riding oxen, but our adventure was far from smooth. The first ox was restless, the second even more so, and the third was finally calm enough for Jack to ride.

After giving our thirst a break, we watched the oxen drinking eagerly at the pond, their eyes softening with contentment. Their bellies, once sunken, now swelled to the point of bursting after quenching their thirst. Unfortunately, these creatures were plagued by the tsetse fly, a tiny yet deadly insect in Africa. This fly, fatal to animals like horses and oxen, causes swelling and eventual death. However, it does not harm humans. When bitten, the animals display symptoms like swelling, runny eyes, and emaciation before passing away. Natives avoid the fly's habitat to protect their herds. We encountered natives on our journey, startling one warrior who mistook us for ghosts. Laughter ensued, terrifying the warrior more. Eventually, we shared food and parted ways, understanding their struggles.|"['1.

"The saying ""It never rains but it pours"" holds true. Events usually come in clusters, not alone. I've noticed this pattern in life. For instance, while fishing in my homeland, some days I'd catch nothing, and others, my basket overflowed. This trend followed me to Africa. Initially, we found no creatures in the gorilla country. However, after days of despair, we stumbled upon gorilla tracks. Excitement and anxiety surged within us. As we followed the tracks, the forest grew dense, revealing the immense power of these creatures. Eventually, we heard a thundering roar after a shot was fired, unlike anything I've ever heard.

For a moment, we froze, ready with our guns, anticipating an attack. Leaves and branches rustled where the wounded monster had been. We cautiously followed, finding the gorilla tearing the ground, its thighs broken. Its chest beat like a drum, a terrifying sight. The monster's expression was demonic, striking fear. As it roared and tried to rise, its legs failed, and it collapsed in fury. Jack, steady, shot it dead as it lunged. The gorilla's colossal size and strength amazed us.

One evening, as I worked by the campfire while my companions slept, their restless features and clenched hands hinted at fierce battles with gorillas in their dreams. The day after our first gorilla encounter was significant, with ten gorillas sighted. We hunted four, sparing a baby and its mother. We debated whether to camp by a brook or hunt across the plain. Jack proposed we split up, but Peterkin cleverly argued against it. Eventually, we decided to hunt. We encountered a wounded monkey, its death touching our hearts. Despite our reluctance to shoot monkeys, hunger sometimes forced our hand. As we set off across the plain, the beauty of nature and the Creator's provision filled me with awe. Our journey was peaceful, yet the presence of savage men in such a paradise troubled me. Our reflections were cut short by Jack's voice.|"['1.

Not all boys are the same. Some are brave and fearless like the boys in the navy, willing to take on great challenges. However, there are also boys who are experts at deceit. One such boy was Doddle, a shy but clever fellow who seemed too big for his clothes. Doddle had been deemed an imbecile by previous schools, and even his mother struggled to instill knowledge in him. When Doddle arrived at a new school, the master tried to teach him grammar and arithmetic, but Doddle could not grasp the lessons.

I was eager to study the different gorilla species and individuals, so I wanted to shoot as many gorillas as possible. After examining the first gorilla thoroughly and taking detailed notes, we killed a female gorilla and her two young ones. We secured them in a tree to study later. Despite finding fresh footprints, we didn't encounter more gorillas. When we spotted a female gorilla with her baby, I couldn't bear to see them harmed and stopped a companion from shooting. The guide, accustomed to harsh acts, reloaded his gun. My friends teased me for being too tender-hearted, but I believed trials like these were beneficial for both humans and animals.

In the dense forest, we encountered an enormous gorilla, standing over six feet tall with a jet-black face filled with rage. Its eyes glared fiercely, and the tuft of hair on its head moved menacingly. The gorilla's massive body seemed mismatched with its legs and long arms. As it beat its chest and roared, we felt a mix of fear and awe. When it advanced towards us, Jack's rifle misfired twice.

During our exciting journey through Africa, we encountered a wide variety of animals, plants, and trees unique to the continent. We saw elephants, deer, buffalo, giraffes, and zebras, as well as rhinoceroses, alligators, leopards, lions, and many types of monkeys. The skies were filled with beautiful and colorful birds. While the journey was delightful, we also witnessed the struggles of wild creatures and the cruel actions of some humans. Once, we encountered a village of natives while trying to avoid them. Unsure of what to do, we feared a fight would break out. To prevent bloodshed, we fled into the forest, with me becoming separated from my companions. Running for my life, I narrowly escaped capture by the natives and found myself at the edge of a cliff overlooking a roaring river.|['1.

I had a close call on a cliff edge. As I fell, I grabbed a bush branch, which broke off but slowed my fall. I crashed through a tree and clung to a branch, terrified. To survive, I crept along the branch to a ledge. The cliff was sheer, no way up or down. I followed the ledge to safety. After a harrowing hour, I rejoined my friend, Jack, relieved.

Recently, we did. Initially, we split up, and I was unsure of what happened to either of you. I had to focus on myself as a dozen rascally individuals were close behind me, pushing my running abilities. I darted into the dense forest, taking a detour to throw them off. Suddenly, I heard bushes rustling ahead, and Peterkin burst through, nearly colliding with me. We both let out a yell. I hurried on, and we crossed an open field together, only to see that only two pursuers were left. We got separated again after re-entering the woods. I waited at the meeting spot, realizing the pursuers had given up. Jack mentioned sending Mak to search for the lost companion. We searched the area where Jack last saw him, hallooing occasionally. After a while, we lost the footprints but heard a faint groan. We cautiously approached and found Peterkin stuck in a hole. With water, he revived and shared how he got hurt.|['1.

Peterkin, our adventurous friend, shared a humorous account of a mishap he encountered. While trying to find his way back after losing sight of Jack, he stumbled into a trap set by locals to catch wild animals. Despite a brief struggle, he managed to escape. However, his misadventure left him feeling unwell, and we had to halt our journey to allow him time to recover. The delay was frustrating, as we were eager to outpace a group of slave traders ahead of us. During this enforced break, I observed some fascinating aspects of nature, like a spider that crafted a door for its home and a tree entirely cloaked in spider webs.

On our third morning after the incident, we resumed our journey with Peterkin leading the way. Despite the lost time from the past two days, the moment we left our camp, a sense of relief washed over us, and we walked with renewed energy and joy. We conversed about various topics, from the scenery around us to our future plans and past adventures. Jack reflected on our success in the gorilla country, mentioning that we had encountered thirty-three creatures. Peterkin humorously suggested that our encounters may have resulted in more deaths, painting a comical yet dark picture. As we rested on a fallen tree trunk, we admired the sunset over the prairie, listening to the lively sounds of birds. Our peaceful moment was interrupted by Jack's sudden exclamation, bringing us back from our tranquil thoughts.|"['1.

"Excitedly, I exclaimed, ""A zebra!"" as we spotted the magnificent animal. Eager for a meal, we hoped to shoot it for supper. Our friend knelt down, aimed carefully, and with a single shot, the zebra fell. The stunning accuracy left us in awe. Amidst our amazement, we swiftly moved to the zebra and marveled at its beauty. While my companions prepared a campsite, I observed and took notes. As night fell, we settled by the fire, enjoying the zebra steaks. Little did we know, a startling surprise awaited us.

"Jack, reloading his rifle, admitted, ""I was asleep when the lion roared, but luckily my rifle was close. I took a quick aim from my sitting position. If not for that, the lion might have attacked us."" As they sat by the fire, they reminisced about the encounter. They regretted not being able to take the lion's skin but kept its teeth and claws as mementos. They noticed smaller elephants with larger tusks up north. At night, they watched elephants joyfully drink and play by the water. The narrator found watching these scenes at night near water bodies fascinating.

Deciding not to travel the next day, we chose to hide by the pond's edge. I planned to stay all night with my notebook under the bright moonlight. As we finished dinner, the moon rose, and we readied to observe. We brought our rifles for safety, though we didn't intend to shoot. The pond sparkled in the moon's glow, surrounded by trees and bushes. We cleared a spot on a hillock for a good view. We watched various animals approach to drink, like antelopes and giraffes. Suddenly, a loud step hinted at a massive creature nearing. Despite feeling uneasy, we stayed hidden, hoping for a safe night of observation.|"[""1.

In the African wilderness, a hunter faces imminent danger. A massive black rhinoceros approached them suddenly, resembling an elephant on short legs. The creature's power filled them with awe. As they held their breath, a herd of elephants emerged at the pond, trumpeting joyfully. The young elephants played while the mothers cared for them lovingly. The scene was interrupted by the rhinoceros, motionless and staring at the elephants. Jack and Peterkin aimed their rifles, ready to act. In that tense moment, the hunter's surroundings were extraordinary. With the rhinoceros close by, a giraffe hesitating, and the elephants reveling in the moonlight, the hunters took their shot.

The noise that followed our gunshots was beyond words. It was a chaotic mix of trumpeting, roaring, crashing, and shrieking. It felt like the wild beasts of many menageries were breaking free all at once. The thunderous sounds of large animals were terrifying. Suddenly, a royal roar from a lion behind us sent shivers down our spines. We were petrified. Makarooroo's tales of man-eating lions made us spring up in fear. As we turned to face the lion, a wounded rhinoceros charged towards us. In a moment of panic, we ran in different directions. I tripped and fell, narrowly escaping the rhinoceros's stampede. As I got up and ran, I heard a fierce growl behind me, followed by the sounds of a lion and rhinoceros clashing. My focus was on reaching safety, but a growl ahead made me stop abruptly. I cautiously retreated, only to witness a tense standoff between Jack and a lion, mere yards apart. Their intense stare-off was a moment of raw courage and fear.|"['1.

I couldn't see the lion's face, but I wasn't curious. I realized I was in the line of fire and could be shot if my friend missed the lion. Unsure what to do, moving might startle the lion, but staying put risked being hit. I trusted Jack's aim and stayed still. The lion started to move away but then turned towards me.

Lions and hyenas roared, adding to their unease. They reached Mbango's village, finding it in ruins with corpses and signs of war. The sight was horrifying, with houses burnt and bodies scattered.

"""Our guide advanced. The slight noise he made in doing so attracted the poor woman's attention, and caused her to look up with a wild, quick glance. The instant she saw us she leaped up with the agility of a leopard, clasped her dead child tightly to her breast, and uttering shriek upon shriek, rushed headlong into the jungle. We all felt the truth of this, and joined in the chase at top speed. But although we ran fast and well, the affrighted creature at first outstripped us. Then, as we tired her out and drew near, she doubled on her track, and dived hither and thither among the thick underwood in a way that rendered it exceedingly difficult to catch her. Peterkin was the first to come up with her. He gradually but perseveringly ran her down. When he came within a few yards of her, the poor creature sank with a low wail to the ground, and turning half round, glanced at her pursuer with a timid, imploring, yet despairing expression. Alas! despair mingled with it, because she knew too well the terrible cruelty of savage men when their blood is up, and she knew nothing yet of the hearts of Christians. Peterkin, whose susceptible nature was ever easily touched, felt a thrill of self-reproach as the thought suddenly occurred that, however good his intentions might be, he was in reality running a helpless woman down like a blood"|"['1.

Makarooroo explained the events of the attack to us. The woman shared how the trader surprised them at night, capturing Mbango, Okandaga, and others. Despite the grim news, our spirits lifted as we learned the attackers planned to seek help from a nearby tribe instead of attacking King Jambai's village directly. We hurried to warn the king. Upon arrival, the village welcomed us warmly. King Jambai was grateful for our warning and offered aid in defending his people. We also confessed our role in Okandaga's escape and sought forgiveness. The king advised us to keep it a secret. We then strategized with the king and divided tasks among us to scout the enemy and plan our defense.

"After a hearty supper, we gathered the scouts and sent them off as night fell. A huge bonfire brought the village men together, listening to the king's speech about the impending danger. Jack, introduced as their leader, taught them commands. The warriors learned ""Forward!"" ""Halt!"" and ""Fire!"" in a drill. Jack warned them to be ready for battle, enforced by the king's threat for disobedience. The next morning, a scout reported the Portuguese trader's camp near a pond, preparing to attack.

"Peterkin, filled with compassion, gently placed his hand on the child's head. ""Mak, ensure they care for him well; they'll be rewarded generously for it, but don't mention payment. It's better to show gratitude for their kindness,"" he said. Jack agreed, suggesting they reward the villagers later without specifying the reason. ""Let's appreciate their care for the boy,"" he added. They then planned the division of troops under Jack's leadership, with musketeers under Peterkin, and spear and bowmen under another. The king led the home-guard. Jack emphasized obedience for victory, practicing commands like ""Forward,"" ""Halt,"" and ""Fire.""

"At a signal, we commanded ""Forward!"" and the entire band marched into the woods ahead of the king, vanishing like a dream. His majesty was left astounded, frozen in place, eyes and mouth wide open. The groups split up, heading in different directions, encircling the king. After a loud whistle, we received the command to move forward again. I led my men through the rough terrain, maintaining four lines with great discipline. Bursting out of the woods, I slowed down to allow the other groups to catch up. As we entered the village, our formation was disrupted, but we quickly reorganized as we reached the center. All the commanders converged on the king simultaneously, creating a solid square. The men, surprised and impressed by their synchronized movement, let out a cheer. Jack suggested introducing a British cheer, but realizing it wasn't suitable, we stuck to their usual shout.

Jack, with seriousness, handed out small paper balls to the natives. He had crafted these from newspapers the night before. The savages, unfamiliar with paper, were intrigued by the printed characters. Jack warned that any foreign objects mixed in would ruin his plan. The bullets were not lethal but would scare the enemy. The group was to move silently after dark. The leader's toothy grin added to the tension. The king emphasized duty, with a chilling threat for those who failed. Jack's strategy involved ambush and stealth, with a plan to attack the enemy camp. The troops were ready for action, armed with muskets and bows. The scene was set for a dramatic confrontation.|"['1.

The guards were absent, focused on cooking their meal, leaving about a hundred captives near a fire. Among them, the figures of Mbango and Okandaga were recognized. The plan was for a simultaneous attack by both parties, with the first shot to be fired by the troops in the dell. Jack positioned the musketeers in rows to cover the approach, while the spearmen were placed on the flanks. Peterkin, after a comical preparation, awaited the enemy's approach. Sitting on a mound, he watched the enemy's advance, feeling eerie and haunted by doubts. As he observed a dark figure pass by, he hesitated but dismissed it, assuming it was a scout.

In a dell, a group led by a Portuguese slave-dealer marched into a trap set by Jack. Positioned strategically, Jack's men surprised the enemy with a deafening cheer and a volley of gunfire. The enemy, terrified, fled in panic as Peterkin, with his powder-cones ablaze, added to their fear. In the chaos, Peterkin stumbled down a hill, scattering the enemy ranks. Meanwhile, Jack's clever tactics kept the enemy at bay until he signaled the pursuit. As the men charged forward, the enemy fled in terror. Peterkin, though bruised, joked about his wild descent. Jack reassured him that the enemy's fright would ensure their escape. The group listened for Ralph's gunfire, confident in their victory.|"[""1.

"During the battle at the dell, upon hearing the first shot, I quietly commanded ""Forward!"" My soldiers swiftly followed, impressing me with their silent movements from bush to bush. Approaching the camp within thirty yards, we startled the enemy who fled, dropping their weapons. Unfortunately, we also scared away the people we intended to rescue. In the heat of the moment, I ordered a pursuit but realized my mistake too late. My men, caught up in the chase, didn't heed my calls to stop. As they disappeared into the jungle, I found myself alone in the enemy's camp. Reunited with my companions, we tried to track the fugitives but failed.

The king quickly agreed to Jack's idea of organizing a grand pursuit as soon as the scouts brought in news. However, when the scouts returned, the plans changed completely. The first scout reported encountering a large enemy camp near a pond. He overheard their conversation, learning two crucial details: they planned to head northeast back to their lands, and their escaped prisoners used a canoe found by the river near King Jambai's village. This news led the king to gather his followers for an immediate pursuit. Meanwhile, Jack proposed getting a canoe to follow Mbango and his group to the coast. Despite the long journey, they considered it necessary. Jack's persuasive skills were evident as he convinced his companions of the importance of their mission.|"[""1.

"Let's move forward. Surely, he will show up soon. How about we follow this stream? It might lead us back to our camp, and the area on the left looks clear of dense vegetation."" Suddenly, we heard a cracking sound from the opposite direction, as if someone heavy was stepping on branches. The noise grew louder, and Jack gave me a surprised look, a smile creeping across his face. Nodding at each other, we cautiously approached the source of the sound, hindered by the brook's gurgling. As we neared the stream's banks, we could hear Peterkin's voice talking to someone who remained silent. Peterkin was lying on the grass, facing a gigantic frog, shaking his finger and engaging in a one-sided conversation.

Peterkin, with a stern frown, scolded the frog for its lazy leap and threatened to poke its nose. He pondered if the frog knew maternal affection or had a mother. Peterkin even joked about taking the frog to England to be stuffed in a museum. As he teased the frog, he suddenly turned pale at the sight of a black rhinoceros nearby. The rhinoceros, with its menacing appearance, stood just a few yards away. Peterkin's friends, alarmed, grabbed their rifles.

We had no time for thinking. Jack and I quickly aimed our rifles - he at the shoulder, me at the eye of the rhinoceros. The shots made Peterkin snap out of his trance. The wounded beast charged towards us, crashing through the bushes and into the river. We swiftly reloaded as Peterkin grabbed his rifle. The rhino struggled to climb the steep bank, blood pouring from its eye. I ran to distract it, while Jack and Peterkin shot it down. The rhino fell at my feet. We discussed preserving its horn as a memento. Later, we encountered the Nshiego Mbouve monkey's unique dwelling.

Peterkin doubted if the man would return that night, pointing out how disappointments often occur when waiting for someone. He mentioned how things seem to go wrong when you want them to go right. Ralph agreed, sharing observations of how people are always out when you need them. They then discussed odd occurrences, like house numbers moving and umbrellas bringing rain. As they chatted, an ape approached, climbing a tree to its leafy shelter. The ape settled down comfortably, hugging the tree, ready to sleep.

In the wilderness, we encountered a tribe of natives preparing for a grand hunt using a unique trap. The trap, called a hopo, consisted of conducting hedges leading to a pit that trapped animals. The natives, numbering in the hundreds, formed a line to drive the game into the trap. As the line advanced, various animals like buffaloes, zebras, and giraffes were forced out of hiding. Jack suggested we move outside the hedges for a better view. Soon, a herd of buffaloes, gnus, and zebras burst out, creating chaos. The natives, armed with spears, skillfully aimed at the animals. The scene was intense, with the natives and animals in a frenzy of shouting and movement, showcasing the raw power of nature and human cooperation in the hunt.|['1.

A dramatic scene unfolded as a herd of wild animals stampeded towards a narrow pit, pursued by native hunters. Spears flew, wounded animals struggled, and the ground was soon littered with the dying. The rush of animals drew closer to the pit's edge, where a chaotic and tragic event unfolded. The creatures tumbled into the abyss, met by spears and yells. Despite the necessity of the hunt for the local tribe's food, the spectacle was horrific. Eventually, the hunters and the narrator decided to leave, slipping away under cover.

Jack, seated at the front of the canoe, suggested that they should apologize to the men they were chasing. As they paddled swiftly, the only sounds were the water splashing. Peterkin broke the silence, wishing for another person to help. They closed in on the fugitives, who readied a gun. Jack advised standing still to avoid being shot. They hurriedly signaled they meant no harm, causing both groups to land on opposite banks. Peterkin joked about defending themselves with their rifles. They secured their canoe and prepared to negotiate with the other party.|"[""1.

The latter part of this message was for Njamie's young child, known as Puggy by Peterkin, not in a disrespectful way but as a term of endearment. We had accepted it, and so had the boy, unaware of its meaning. Mak and I approached the locals unarmed and recognized each other. I was thrilled to see Okandaga's familiar face, and she ran towards me joyfully. Simultaneously, I greeted Mbango warmly, and he showed his affection by rubbing noses with me. Among Mbango's crew, a woman caught my attention, sitting on a rock in deep sorrow. She was Njamie, Mbango's wife, indicating her distress. I hurried back to our canoe, fetched the little boy, and brought him to his mother, Njamie, who was overwhelmed with happiness at their reunion. The joy on their faces was a reward for all our efforts and risks.|['1.

After our initial excitement waned, we discussed our next steps. Makarooroo and his bride wanted to head to the coast for their Christian wedding. Jack pointed out the challenge of language without an interpreter. Ultimately, we decided to accompany Mak to the coast, giving up further hunting in Africa. Peterkin humorously suggested a compromise to Mak's amusement. As we planned our journey, I suggested taking a longer route through gorilla territory, hoping to encounter game. Little did I know, this decision would lead to a dangerous encounter with a gorilla weeks later. Separated from my friends and armed with only a small rifle, I hesitated before following the gorilla tracks, unsure of my shooting skills.|"[""1.

I encountered a gorilla while hunting alone. The beast, larger than any seen before, roared and advanced slowly towards me. Despite my fear, I aimed my rifle and fired, but the gorilla kept coming. I threw my knife, hitting its chest before being struck down. The rifle took the blow, shattering, and I was thrown to the ground, losing consciousness.|"['1.
