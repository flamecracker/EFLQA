Fred and his friends were determined to find Colon. Fred took the lead in planning the search. Bristles criticized the others for their haphazard approach and emphasized the need for a systematic plan. They decided to trace Colon's route from Bristles' house, assuming he went on a practice run. They suspected he took a lonely road, unfamiliar to them.

The woman mentioned seeing a white horse and a covered wagon heading toward the graveyard, a sight she found familiar. Sid confirmed knowing the man with the horse, recalling how he used to urge the horse on with a whip. The woman added that sometimes the man falls asleep on his wagon after buying corn for his hogs, as he lives far up the road. The conversation then turned to a supposedly haunted mill near Riverport. Bristles and Sid discussed the mill, with Bristles mentioning how the boys used to play around it, sliding over the big wheel. Sid shared that the mill had been closed up and abandoned, making it an ideal hiding spot. As they continued walking, Semi-Colon, despite being out of breath, persisted in keeping up with the group.

"""Fast; eh, Fred?"" asked Sid, as he saw the other make a vain attempt to open the door of the mill; through which doubtless the office had been reached in times past, when the neighboring farmers all came here daily to have their grist ground, and to carry home their flour.

""I think a key has been used here lately,"" replied the other. ""I can see marks around the keyhole to tell that. Chances are, they had one made to fit the door. A smart fellow could take an impression of the lock with wax, or something, and a locksmith would make him a key that would answer.""

Once more, fellows, and all together, give it to her!"" Fred continued; and the three exerted themselves to their utmost to break the door's fastenings, or hinges, by a combination of their strength, which was considerable.

One, two, three more tremendous pushes and there was a crash as the door gave way before the united efforts of the three determined lads. Either the rusty lock had been unable to hold out longer, or else the hinges were in a state of complete collapse.

""N-no, not much, I guess,"" Bristles replied, as he began to struggle once more to his feet, aided by Fred's ready hand; but as the breath had been pretty well knocked out of him by the concussion, Bristles, for once, lacked words to explain his feelings.

Fred found himself in a challenging situation as he pondered his options in the quarry. Despite his efforts, he couldn't devise a plan with any hope of success. Shouting for help had failed before, and the remote location made it unlikely for his calls to be heard. Despite the slim odds, Fred continued to shout, hoping for a miracle.

Fred Fenton was in a tough spot, stuck in a hole with Buck Lemington taunting him. Buck mocked Fred for having a private running course, insinuating that Fred thought he was too important. Fred, eager to get out of the hole, cleverly suggested using a nearby vine. Buck, sarcastically praising Fred's idea, slowly cut the vine and lowered it to help Fred escape.

Fred expressed his gratitude for Buck's help, remarking on the unlikely coincidence of their meeting. Buck revealed that people from Riverport had accused him of a scheme to sabotage their plans by leaving Colon at the mill. Angered by his father's reaction to the accusations, Buck decided to leave home temporarily and devised a plan to negotiate with his father.

Fred experienced bitter disappointment when the bully, Buck, revealed his true colors by snatching away the vine Fred had worked hard to cut. Buck's deception became evident as he taunted Fred, blaming him for all his misfortunes since Fred arrived in town. Despite Buck's false accusations, Fred refused to lower himself by pleading for help from his vindictive rival. Buck callously threw the vine away, leaving Fred stranded in the limestone pit. As Fred faced the prospect of spending the night shivering in the cold, Buck callously decided to leave him there.

Fred suddenly felt the urge to visit the Mastersons to share news about Buck's arrival, even though he couldn't explain this impulse.

At the track meet, the runners dashed off like rabbits at the sound of the pistol. Colon cleverly trailed behind, observing his opponents.
