"Every so often, a gentle, rushing sound piqued Johnny's interest so much that he once limped painfully up the courtyard to peer into the trees. On one occasion, he caught glimpses of a small creature, adorned in blue, white, and gold, who peeked out from the green foliage, nodding and attempting to offer him a cluster of chestnut flowers. Overwhelmed with joy, Johnny reached out to her, forgetting his crutches, and almost stumbled if he hadn't gripped a window shutter quickly, straining his back. When he looked up again, the fairy had disappeared, leaving only dancing leaves in the wind. ""How I wish I could peek in and see how it truly looks! It sounds and smells so summery and nice in there,"" thought Johnny. Laughing at himself, he spoke to the white cat, who purred in response. Unable to describe the beauty below, Johnny returned to his picture. Enthused by the thought of emulating Monte Cristo, Johnny began chipping away at a loose brick with an old pair of scissors, eager to take a peek. After successfully creating a hole, he hesitated, then leaned forward to catch a glimpse of the enchanting scene beyond. He saw a bed of tulips, a colorful bird, a sleeping Princess, and more, feeling like he was peering into a fairy-tale world."|"[""1.

Excited to execute his plan, Johnny attached a lengthy string to his most colorful poster and tied it to the pole he used for fishing, aiming to catch the cool breezes in the courtyard. The wind, his trusty friend, quickly grasped the concept and swept the red paper over the wall. It fluttered among the tulips, stirring the dog awake and prompting it to bark. Johnny released the string, peeking through his hole. The Princess, now wide-eyed, clapped joyfully as Pippo presented the vibrant picture. Johnny, feeling encouraged by his success, stole another glance. Through the hole, he gazed into a bright blue eye, framed by golden locks, a dainty nose, and red lips. The Princess extended a hand through the opening, offering lilies and expressing her delight. Johnny shared his story, and the Princess, impressed by his bravery, sent an orange through the hole to help with his pain. She found him good and offered a book to read. Overjoyed, Johnny flourished, receiving gifts and kindness that brightened his days.|['1.
