"""The response?"" Jack stated, once calm had returned somewhat, ""I assumed everyone knew that the Chinese wash their garments in the Gulf of Tong King and hang them to dry on the mountains of Kwang Tung! Are we headed there, Ned?"" he asked, turning to his friend Ned Nestor, seated by a window overlooking the city. ""Are we going to the Gulf of Tong King?""

""One question at a time!"" chuckled Ned. ""To answer the first question, Captain Moore is the Secret Service officer guiding us on our mission to Chinese waters. Secondly, he'll be the leader as long as he's with us. Thirdly, I'm unsure if he's joining us on the journey.""

A knock interrupted the conversation, and in walked Captain Moore, a tall man with a stern face and cold blue eyes. The boys in the room, members of the Black Bear Patrol, observed him closely. Captain Moore inspected the room with its hunting and fishing decorations, acknowledging the wealth of the boys' families.

Ned, known for his successful government missions, was about to embark on a significant assignment. The details of this new mission were to be discussed that evening in the clubroom.

The guest may have felt the unfriendliness and quickly took out a stack of papers, placing them on the table. Suddenly, the boys realized they misjudged the Secret Service agent. As he discussed the reason for his visit, his demeanor shifted. He transformed from a haughty naval officer to a sharp-witted expert, questioning Ned about submarines. The Captain explained a recent incident where a mail boat sank with $10,000,000 in gold. Allegations surfaced that the gold was meant to fund radical activities in China. The plan was to board a mail steamer in San Francisco, then rendezvous with a submarine in Hainan. Ned was granted permission to bring three companions on the expedition. The Admiral expressed concerns about disloyalty and unauthorized changes to the mission's plans.|"['1.

The man on the boat appeared to have suffocated as there were no visible wounds. Despite a lingering odor, fresh air was gradually dispelling it. The detective advised the boys to search for clues left by the assassin, emphasizing that even the most careful person leaves traces. Ned inquired about the man they encountered, suspecting foul play. They examined waste for clues and found rubber paint used to conceal fingerprints. The culprit likely wore blue wool clothing, evidenced by wool fibers in the rubber. They launched a rowboat to investigate further, leaving two boys to guard the submarine.

As they waited on the corner for a patrol wagon, the policeman explained why they were being arrested. A man who had entered their submarine had not been seen since. The man who reported this had an agreement with the missing man to watch outside. The chief of police mentioned a rubber composition found on a chair that could help track the thief. The submarine belonged to the Government's Secret Service, so it was crucial to find the thief. The chief quickly organized a search at the wharf. When they arrived, they found Jack and Frank handcuffed. The Coroner examined the seemingly dead man and seemed puzzled. After some time, he removed the handcuffs from the boys.|"['1.

Lieutenant Scott's remarkable recovery amazed everyone, leading Ned to realize they had overlooked important details. Despite their excitement, Ned was ready to descend into the water. After a fascinating journey, the boys finally arrived at their destination on October 20th. The Sea Lion was safely afloat, and they spent time studying its mechanisms under the hood. Submerged near Taya Islands, the Sea Lion behaved well. Unfortunately, it was now at the bottom of the sea permanently. Lieutenant Scott had recovered due to the open hatch during the gas incident. The Moores were suspected of causing trouble, possibly out of envy and revenge. Ned and Jimmie prepared to dive wearing special suits and helmets, equipped with searchlights and defense tools for exploring the ocean floor.|"[""1.

"Jimmie excitedly exclaimed, ""I'll catch a shark and make him learn how!"" He then pondered how he would appear walking down the Bowery in his suit, imagining the boys' reactions. After industriously settling into their suits, the boys prepared to put on their heavy helmets. Jimmie pointed out a belt on his suit, signaling readiness. Once the helmets were on and the air was turned on, the boys felt exhilarated. As the water chamber filled, they experienced a cold sensation rising from their toes to their heads. The submarine, Sea Lion, descended smoothly to the ocean floor. Ned, the leader, then opened the door and ventured out, followed by Jimmie. They navigated the ocean depths, illuminated by the moon and searchlights, marveling at the beauty of the underwater world filled with colorful sea creatures."|['1.

In the deep sea, peculiar sea creatures swam around the divers in their rubber suits. Some fish curiously inspected the divers, while Ned focused on finding the wreck of the Cutaria. As Ned and Jimmie explored, they encountered an unexpected sight - the hull of the sunken vessel. The boys carefully navigated the ridges and pits of the seabed until they reached the wreck. Ned confirmed that they had indeed found the lost mail ship, partially buried in sand.

Near the ship's left side, a bit closer to the back than the front, the boy found the injury that had caused the ship to sink. The vessel was tilted in eighty feet of water. Ned was puzzled why other boats hadn't spotted it. The tall stacks were broken, but the upper part was close to the surface. Ned signaled Jack and Frank to wait outside while he went in. He protected his air-hose from sharp edges as he explored. Ned noticed some air-tight compartments were still secure, suggesting trapped air. He couldn't reach the cabin due to cargo shifting. As he turned back, he heard a strange sound from behind a wall. Ned suspected the vibration was caused by moving water. He examined the sea bottom with the boys, planning to use the submarine to access the wreck.|"[""1.

Ned shared that Captain Moore suspected rebel leaders planned to intercept a gold shipment once it left American protection. The trio, equipped with helmets, explored a sunken wreck using drop lines and signaling gear. Inside, they found a cabin filled with haunting remnants of the ship's past. Despite the eerie surroundings, they pressed on to locate the captain's sealed papers. This underwater mission was unlike any they had faced before, feeling isolated from the world.

There was no doubt about it now. A submarine lay just a few yards away, hidden in the dark depths. The men inside had taken precautions, with lines and air-hoses securely passing through guarded openings. Ned wished he had been as cautious when leaving his own boat. As he observed from a safe distance, men in helmets with electric lamps were trying to access the ship's hold. Ned realized the gold inside might still be there, blocked from removal. Meanwhile, Jimmie, alone in their vessel, watched the ocean floor for signs of his friends. Suddenly, a figure approached the submarine, moving strangely. Jimmie waited, heart racing, until the figure entered their chamber. But as he prepared to switch on the light, the swimmer's suspicious actions made him pause.|"[""1.

The intruder on the submarine was breathing air from a different source than the Sea Lion. He carefully placed his air-hose in a groove by the door, using a soft material to fill the gap. Disconnecting his hose, he knocked on the door where Jimmie was. Jimmie, unsure of what to do, considered using a rope to restrain the intruder. Meanwhile, Frank and Ned discussed the suspicious activities of the Diver's crew. Ned believed they were planning an attack.

In the early morning, the Diver was spotted heading north, resembling a voyage. The Sea Lion easily trailed her lights shining in the deep sea. Ned warned that losing sight of her could make it hard to find her again. The plan was to catch her, recover what she took, and hold her for the authorities. The pursuit continued day and night until the Diver reached a protected bay. Ned, Frank, and another boy examined a map in the submarine's conning tower. Ned pondered why the Diver, now called the Shark, stopped there. He feared she might be meeting a ship to hand over the plunder. Ned worried about missing the chance to search the wreck first.

Ned found the plan to ship gold to China and have it seized by revolutionary leaders to be poorly thought out. The gold-laden ship was sunk by a foreign nation aware of the scheme. Ned suspected the foreign government was searching for incriminating papers. He instructed his companion to investigate the ocean floor for mines and keep an eye on the Shark ship. As they explored, sea creatures surrounded them. When Jimmie signaled to stop, Ned raised the submarine to the surface, unaware of the danger Jimmie faced.

Ned and Jack quickly launched a small boat from the Sea Lion. Despite its narrow size, it was sturdy. Paddling softly, the boys headed west, spotting a smooth white shore leading to wooded hills. No locals were in sight. As they approached a cluster of buildings, Ned suggested using an interpreter to gather information about potential strangers or the Shark group. Jack ventured ahead towards the town, observing movements in the street. Suddenly, a chubby boy in ill-fitting clothes emerged. Meanwhile, Jack, waiting in the thicket, noticed a commotion in the village below. Natives and Europeans stirred the town. As Hans neared Jack, a pursuer chased him. Jack tripped the pursuer, helping Hans escape.|['1.

Explanations resolved the issue. A man from a submarine met another at a trader's shop. Hans, eager to eavesdrop, hid near a safe and was discovered. The incident stirred the town, with many witnessing the chase. To reassure the Englishman, Hans was searched, but nothing was found. Ned then asked a question. The Englishman left without protest, and they saw Ned heading to the Sea Lion. As Ned approached, the conning tower vanished underwater. Jimmie faced a sea monster, thinking it was the original sea serpent. The creature coiled around his leg, making it hard to cut. Jimmie struck a vital spot, ending the battle. The water turned red as he hurried away. Jimmie returned to the submarine, passing the Shark. He signaled to move forward, cautiously watching for more threats. Finally, he joined Frank in sea attire before resurfacing.|"['1.

"""We need to be cautious exploring the sea floor,"" he warned. ""Luck saved you this time. Hitting a vital spot on a sea creature is rare,"" he explained. ""When we return, I'll claim a medal for you!"" Jimmie joked. ""Ned can make you a medal from a fish fin,"" Frank chuckled. As time passed, worry grew for Ned and Jack. They might have returned and ventured inland, assuming an accident with the submarine. ""The Shark risks bumping us at depth,"" he noted. ""But if she strikes, her blow will glance off when we're settled on the bottom,"" Jimmie reassured. Suddenly, Jimmie spotted figures approaching Jack and Ned. ""Watch out!"" he yelled, warning of an approaching threat. He swiftly navigated the submarine, ensuring safety.

Hans shouted angrily at Hamblin, accusing him of putting bugs in his bed and disturbing his sleep. The situation escalated as Hans landed a punch on the Captain, causing a commotion among the natives. The trader intervened and communicated with the natives, leading them to leave with the unconscious man. Meanwhile, Ned revealed to Jack that his son was safe on board the Sea Lion. As the boys dealt with the smoke and fire in the submarine, Moore attempted to escape but was stopped by Frank. Moore explained that he hesitated to share the fire's cause fearing the room would be flooded. In the end, the situation was diffused, and the danger was averted.|"[""1.

"""Get back in the den,"" Frank ordered sternly. ""We've had enough of your disrespect. You tried to harm Lieutenant Scott at Mare Island Navy Yard, endangered our lives on this boat, and now you've set a fire and are trying to escape. You have a lot to answer for, young man.""

""You can talk tough now,"" Moore replied, ""but that's all you can do. My father is after you and that Ned Nestor. When you return without the gold, he'll make sure you pay. Lock me up and leave, I'm tired of your faces.""

Hans was amazed as he stepped onto the submarine's conning tower and peered inside. Moore made a futile attempt to provoke the boys before heading downstairs. The boys followed, but Moore reached the controls first, aiming the submarine towards the beach.

Ned realized the sealed packet was still on the Shark and resolved to pursue the submarine. He knew the packet held sensitive documents that could impact international relations. Despite the risks, Ned was determined to retrieve the packet.

""They want the papers for the money they can fetch,"" Ned remarked. ""Those papers have value, and they won't be destroyed.""

The boys on the Sea Lion were concerned about the mysterious activities on the Shark. They observed the commotion on the brilliantly lit boat and suspected issues with its air supply after the collision. As they watched, they noticed the door to the water chamber left open, indicating a possible malfunction. Frank speculated that the door mechanism might be broken.

"""Wait,"" shouted Jack, ""let's not rush! We need to ensure Ned has the Shark people's attention before we make a move. If they spot us advancing before Ned talks to them, they might act recklessly."" The submarine's progress hadn't alerted those on the Shark's conning tower. Ned's boat floated near the tower, with Frank and Hans at the back. ""We're lucky,"" exclaimed Jack. ""Once we contact a warship, we'll hand the pirates over to Uncle Sam and retrieve the gold."" Frank noted, ""The Shark was adrift when we found her, right? We're due salvage rights. We'll submit a bill that'll cover everything!""

The group understood the situation, and no weapons were discovered during the search. Among the rescued individuals were five ordinary sailors, unfamiliar with submarine operations, while the sixth was the Shark's captain. This man had joined forces with young Moore to pilfer valuable items from the wreck, including important documents. Despite his respectable appearance, his deceitful eyes and mouth raised suspicions for Ned. Babcock, along with Captain Moore, was confined. The boys overheard a heated exchange between the two men. Outside, the crew members were restrained by Hans, Jack, and Jimmie. Some sailors managed to escape into the sea, except for one who was lost. The boys learned that the sailors had a coordinated plan in case of trouble, indicating a dangerous plot. Their destination was Canton, a significant city near the mouth of the Si River.

The boy sat alone on the conning tower platform that evening when a sailor from the Sea Lion approached him. The sailor, an American, expressed his willingness to help Ned. He warned Ned that the escaped men would inform others about the Sea Lion's situation, making their journey dangerous. The men who escaped were likely on the mainland, able to communicate with Canton. Ned thought about the sealed packet's contents, which could implicate the government in a plot against China. The Sea Lion faced challenges due to the leaked information about the gold shipment and the mysterious steamer that rammed their ship. Despite the risks in diplomatic cases, Frank expressed a desire for a detective case instead.

"When the anchor dropped in a small bay by the mouth, sheltered by old warehouses built by native traders, Jack rushed up to meet Ned. ""Jack,"" Ned chuckled, ""your imagination is so vivid, you could write fiction. But it's almost too unbelievable for paper. I'll see what the Captain wants."" Captain Moore was visibly anxious. Ned noticed it immediately as the door creaked open. ""Heading to Canton?"" the Captain asked, his voice trembling. ""She'll blow up, and me with it!"" the Captain almost screamed. In no time, the prisoners were transferred to the warship under Captain Harmon. The trip to Canton was crucial to identify the conspirators and inform the U.S. Government about the foreign interference.
