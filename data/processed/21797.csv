"""Mother, we're afloat again,"" a gruff voice said. The old fisherman slept on, indifferent to their home swaying in the wind. His wife, however, worried. Only during storms did their boat-home lift from its moorings. Rusty chains strained as it rocked, threatening to drift away. The fisherman, after a swig from a bottle, assured his wife and son, Bob, before venturing into the storm. They walked to Fellness village to seek aid for a ship in distress.

As the dawn approached, the crew returned to a warm welcome from their comrades. The onlookers were disappointed to see only the crew return from their perilous journey. Coomber believed the child they found was alive and urged Peters to fetch his wife for help. Mrs. Peters, a caring woman, quickly attended to the child.

The following day, Tiny, as she called herself, showed improvement. She rested in a makeshift bed in the family living-room, quietly observing Mrs. Coomber as she cooked, cleaned, and tended to chores, occasionally receiving kisses from the little girl. Mrs. Coomber tried to inquire about Tiny's past, but received no clear answers. The child seemed to have noticed her surroundings and asked for the boys, revealing that her parents were deceased. Mr. Coomber decided they would keep Tiny if no one claimed her within a week. Mrs. Coomber, concerned about Tiny's well-being, asked her son to fetch milk from the neighboring farm, despite her husband's disapproval due to a past quarrel. Mrs. Coomber had been secretly buying milk for the child, which angered her husband. He forbade her from any further dealings with the farm people, causing tension in the household.|"[""1.

The slanting sun rays cast a warm glow over Bermuda Point, where a little fair-haired girl stood, her clothes fluttering around her. Despite her sun-kissed skin, she appeared delicate. She walked to the salt-marsh, filled baskets with samphire, and shed tears over forgotten promises. Her friend, Dick, tried to console her, suggesting that books were of no use to their father. Yet, Tiny felt differently, wondering if God cared for them. Dick, feeling unloved, was comforted by Tiny's declaration of love and her promise to find out if God loved him too. Overwhelmed, Dick wiped away tears, touched by Tiny's kindness and her belief in God's love for him.|"['1.

Tiny eagerly awaited her father's return home that night. She hoped to accompany him to Fellness to sell samphire, dreaming of visiting the shops and maybe even getting a book if they had a good sale. To Tiny, Fellness was a grand town with bright shops, unlike the small fishing village where they lived. Her friend, Dick, warned her that Fellness had only one shop selling basic goods, no books. Despite this, Tiny was determined to get a book. When she spotted her father's boat approaching, she hurriedly filled the baskets with seaweed. With Dick's help, they carried the baskets to the shore just as her father and brother arrived. Her father, Coomber, promised to get her sweets instead of a book, understanding her desire. As they rowed back, Tiny thought of asking God to bless her family and fulfill her wish for a book.|"[""1.

The fisherman, uninterested in books, indulged Tiny's wish for a book with sweets instead. Upon arriving at Fellness, Tiny, expecting a bustling town, found only a few fishermen and houses. Disappointed, she burst into tears. Dame Peters, occupied with cooking, showed Tiny a picture. Pictures were rare in cottages then. Tiny, intrigued by the picture, discovered it was a book with writing on the back. Overjoyed, she tried to read but struggled to remember words. She bought the picture-book with samphire. On the boat back, Tiny sang, reminiscent of her mother's hymns. Coomber, distracted, forgot a sailor's star, leading to a search in the boat.|"['1.

The fisherman's family enjoyed a peaceful evening after a singing session calmed the angry fisherman. The little girl, Tiny, was eager to show her treasure, a picture, to her family. Despite her bedtime, Tiny shared her excitement. Her father, usually reserved, was merry, praising Tiny's bravery. They all stayed up late, listening to stories and feeling content. The next morning, Tiny excitedly shared her news with her brothers, but they were busy. Upset, Tiny decided to pick samphire for Dame Peters. Later, she had a moment of reflection about her past. A small conflict arose when she refused to help with the net, but she eventually overcame her stubbornness.

Tiny was a bit let down as the days passed by because her students, Tom and Dick, were losing interest in learning the letters she wrote in the sand or showed on paper. They wanted to know how to put the letters together to form words they could understand. Tiny struggled to overcome this challenge even for herself. She vaguely knew that G O D spelled God but wasn't completely confident to tell Dick. Despite this, Tiny's curiosity grew about what the letters could reveal if she could decode them into words. She spent time tracing the letters and spelling out G O D daily. If the fisherman had been less stubborn in his feud with the farmers, Tiny might have easily resolved the reading difficulty with their help. Dick urged Tiny to ask for assistance from the Hayes children, but Tiny hesitated as she believed it might upset her father. Harry Hayes had a book that caught Dick's attention, but Tiny refrained from approaching them to avoid any conflict.|"['1.

The biscuits lasted them for a while. Coomber sold some wild ducks and bought potatoes, flour, and bread. If only he knew whisky wasn't as important as bread, they wouldn't have suffered. But whenever he got money, he bought whisky instead of enough bread. Tiny wished for biscuits always, so daddy wouldn't drink. Mrs. Coomber smiled as Tiny whispered this to Dick. Coomber came home grumpier due to more money from wild fowl. His return became dreaded. Tiny and Dick would go to bed before he came home. Mrs. Coomber tried to calm the children. Coomber got angry, shook Tiny, and hurt her. Tiny was silent and hurt. Mrs. Coomber was scared. Coomber cried and promised to stop drinking if Tiny survived.
