"""Come on, girls,"" said Betty, somewhat coldly, realizing they couldn't help. The four friends turned back without looking at the girl who declined their offer.

"Betty, with a hint of anger, responded, ""Absolutely not!"" The girls, including Amy and Grace, regained their confidence. The resistance, once they realized no real harm was done, empowered them to stand up for their rights. As he moved closer, the dog growled menacingly, causing even Mollie and Betty to retreat.

Amy's spirits lifted with the support of her friends and the invigorating winter air in the woods. The group received letters from home sporadically. Days were filled with cooking, cabin chores, and walks. A thaw, rain, and freeze led to fun activities like ice skating and boating on the river. They explored the lumber camp, observing where logs were cut and the deserted sawmill. During a walk, they made a peculiar discovery. Despite a past encounter, there had been no further issues. Grace and her friends maintained distance from a group led by Alice's chum, Kittie. Mrs. Jallow engaged in polite conversation, contrasting her daughter's aloofness. The Jallows were staying in one of Mr. Jallow's cabins to oversee timber extraction. Grace and her friends shared their whereabouts, and Mrs. Jallow expressed interest in their well-being.|"['1.

"""Mr. Smither didn't bother us,"" Grace mentioned calmly. ""We understood he was just following orders. Thank you for the invite, but we might not have time to visit.

They followed the river, ensuring a direct path back to camp, avoiding the confusion of the woods. The main concern was the distance from their cabins, the approaching nightfall, and the raging storm. Despite the challenging circumstances, they found solace in the sandwiches and candy Allen shared, boosting their energy. With renewed vigor, they continued their journey. Mr. Franklin shared exciting news about finding a crucial document describing his missing sister's birthmark. He believed the boys could help locate her. The missing piece of paper was discovered by chance, leading to hope for a reunion.

In the summer, it's easy to spot birthmarks like the red 'V' on elbows, said Will. But in winter, it'd be awkward asking about it. Mr. Blackford clarified it's a birthmark, not a tattoo. Amy revealed hers, a scar since childhood. The group enjoyed sledding due to a snowstorm, with Mr. Franklin providing horses. They had fun sleigh riding, oyster suppers, and dances. Mr. Blackford stayed for entertainment. The Jallows didn't bother them. Rain washed away snow, but Mr. Blackford kept them entertained. When the river froze, they went ice boating. During a pleasant outing, they encountered Alice Jallow and friends in another boat. Jake Rossmore patronized them.|['1.

"""Unfortunately, they beat us,"" Frank expressed sadly as Allen guided the _Spider_ effortlessly over the ice, watching their opponents disappear around a bend.

The girls were eager for fresh fish, and the lumbermen were happy to sell them some. The boys enjoyed their meal with the new addition and planned to try ice fishing the next day. They set up hooks with cloth indicators for a good catch. Grace was about to warn about trespassing near Mr. Jallow's timber claim when Amy spotted something in the woods.

Betty and Grace decided to seek help from the lumbermen by the river, leaving Mollie to keep Amy company. As they trudged through the snow towards the fishing spot, they hoped to find the boys learning to ice fish. Meanwhile, Amy explained how the door fell, realizing she had inadvertently triggered it. The girls faced challenges navigating the deep snowdrifts and losing their way. Eventually, they spotted the river from a bluff, correcting their course. Back at the trap, Amy and Mollie discovered it was set on private land, likely by trespassers. Suddenly, a snowball fight broke out, ending with Will's angry reaction.

By now, Will had reached Jake and attempted to hit him, but the blow missed. Jake retaliated with a swing that also fell short, leading to Will pushing him into a snowbank. Jake quickly got back up, hinting at a potential serious fight. However, Allen intervened, proposing a snowball fight instead. He suggested two against two, ensuring fair play. The boys prepared snowballs while Allen marked a line in the snow. The rule was simple: the side that surrenders first loses. As the snowball fight began, hits were exchanged, with most landing on the body. Will got hit in the eye, causing him pain. Despite the intensity, the boys eventually called for a truce to clear snow from their ears. Will then decided to seek help from his father or Hank Smither regarding a bear trap issue. Grace, on the other hand, decided to go back to prevent further conflict, realizing their fathers would not approve of fighting.|"['1.

Grace expressed her concern about the boys' snowball fight, fearing Will's unpredictable anger. The girls, upon reaching the boys, found a harmless battle. Will then shared his exciting project of converting a motor-cycle engine for their ice boat, aiming to eliminate dependence on wind. The boys planned to attach the engine at the back of the boat, replacing the sail with a spiked wheel to propel the boat on ice. This innovative idea intrigued the group, and they hurried home to work on it.

The boys were eager to test their new ice boat, but the motor installation took longer than expected. The girls, tired of waiting, went for a stroll to the village. Mr. Blackford returned, feeling defeated in his search for someone. Allen, Frank, and Mr. Blackford prepared the boat, with Allen steering and Will managing the motor. The boat moved smoothly across the frozen river, propelled by the motor. Meanwhile, the outdoor girls gathered around the ice boat, considering a trip. The boys had used the boat with the girls before, explaining its workings. The warm weather had made the ice too soft for skating, but the boat still offered an adventure.

"""Nonsense! You're thinking of an avalanche!"" declared Mollie. ""Betty means that the cakes of ice will all jam together pretty soon, when the river narrows, and we can walk ashore as nicely as you please, hauling the ice boat after us.""

Their situation was indeed peculiarly fortunate considering what had happened. The warm weather had softened the ice, and the melting of much snow had caused the river to rise. This had had the effect of cracking the covering of ice, and it had broken up. The ice boat got on a certain large section that split off and went floating down the stream.

Mollie and Betty were on the ice, their auto ice boat resting on a big floe. Suddenly, chunks of ice broke off, floating away. Grace and Amy were worried, watching the shrinking floe. A man in a small boat approached to rescue them. The girls realized the boat could only hold two, so it would take multiple trips. The danger increased as the floe decreased. Amy and Grace were scared, but Mollie remained brave. The man planned to secure a line to the ice boat and pull them to safety. The girls saw his boat had iron runners for sliding over ice.

"""Yes!"" replied Betty, checking to confirm. The boat's steel runners and steering plates were stuck in the ice due to its long stillness. The _Spider_ was securely anchored. ""I'll get you to shore soon,"" he assured. ""I'll hurry back, but it's tricky with the ice melting fast. It's early for this, and the river will freeze again heavily. Your ice floe will hold until I bring you all ashore. Just sit tight and don't worry!"" ""I happened to be passing by and saw your situation,"" he explained. ""Luckily, I had a rope and found Muskrat Ike's hidden punt. Now, I'll head back. Stay positive!"" With iron poles, he maneuvered his boat off the floe, paddled, and navigated between ice cakes to reach the shore. The lumberman used a rope to create a bridge to the land as the floe approached. Despite chunks breaking off due to collisions, they successfully brought the ice boat to shallow water. ""That's good advice,"" agreed Allen.
