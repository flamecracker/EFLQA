Jane thought quickly, not bothered by the other girls around her or their interest in the shop. She pondered how to find Judith. A sudden idea struck her - why not go in for a shampoo? Jane, Dozia, Velma, Winifred, Janet, and Inez, six excited girls, contemplated their beauty needs. Dol Vin would struggle with so many requests. Dozia noticed a side door, suggesting a way in. The old stone building was once a retreat for Wellington faculty but now housed Dol Vin's mysterious business. Jane and Dozia, determined to find Judith, requested to use the phone. They listened to the girls on the porch having fun. Jane warned Dol Vin to reveal Judith's whereabouts or face consequences. They left for the town hall, worried about Judith's safety.|"['1.
