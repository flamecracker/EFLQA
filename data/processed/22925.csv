After serving his initial three months in the military, Lincoln's captaincy ended, but he re-enlisted as a private until the war's conclusion.

President Lincoln was resolute in his beliefs about temperance. In 1864, he traveled by steamboat with his wife and son to meet General Grant in Virginia. Lincoln showed kindness not only to animals but also to people, including African Americans.
