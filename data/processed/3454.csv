At present, I have abandoned mere literature and am pondering a book on ‘The Causes of Early Blight in the Potato,’ a serious matter that threatens our food source. When asked about my writing, I often respond with this to avoid discussing my actual literary works. While some assume I only write fairy tales, I have only authored ‘Prince Prigio,’ ‘Prince Ricardo,’ and ‘Tales from a Fairy Court.’ These tales, translated and adapted by Mrs. Lang, are rich in adventure where Princes marry Princesses and everyone lives happily ever after. Unlike traditional fairy tales, the villains in my stories retire with pensions instead of facing cruel punishments. The stories I have worked on are a collaborative effort, with credit due to Mrs. Lang for her significant role in their creation.|"[""1.

Three hundred and sixty-five authors attempt to craft new fairy tales, often starting with a child encountering fairies among flowers and fruits.

They include tales from Arthur's Court, wild Wales, and the firesides of Welsh kinsmen, the Bretons. Some modern stories are also included, translated or adapted by Mrs. Lang, along with a few by other contributors.

After the feast, everyone moved to the grand ballroom. Among the crowd, the Wise Man slyly marked the Shifty Lad's cheek with a black dot, unseen by the lad.

Once upon a time, a prince gifted his wife a comb that made pearls and diamonds fall from her hair when used. But a curse meant he could only remember her at night. As he left her, he gave her a reel of gold thread and half a marriage ring, promising to remember her if she joined it with his. She found herself at a wood near a palace and sought work at a lodge. Annoyed by the palace staff, she tricked the head footman with magic, causing horns to sprout from his head. When the prince learned of this, he visited her and was intrigued by her sewing magic. The witch's daughter, envious, offered to buy the scissors she used.

Once upon a time, a prince passed by a woman who seemed familiar to him. She asked if he ever woke at night.

They sailed away from the 'Land of Nod' to the shores of Asia, at the other end of the world. In the winter mist, they saw Nordenskiold trying to find a way through the ice with his ship Vega. It was freezing, with icebergs shining and whales living under the ice. On the shore, there was snow as far as the eye could see, with grey men in skins driving sledges drawn by dogs. In contrast, they found warm shores with palm trees bearing coconuts, copper-colored men hunting buffaloes, and dangerous encounters with tigers. Anchoring near a green river mouth, they faced a scorching desert where lions roared and crocodiles lurked. Finally, they reached a familiar, friendly place with birch trees, a garden, and people beckoning Little Lasse back for bread-and-butter.|['1.

In one way and another, Moti managed well until one hot evening when he arrived in a city and entered a travellers' inn, known as a serai, to spend the night. A serai is typically a square enclosed by a high wall with an open colonnade inside to accommodate travelers and animals. Being a country lad used to living with cattle, Moti borrowed a bed and slept next to a buffalo. In the middle of the night, he discovered his money was stolen.

The large seals moved gracefully, resembling ocean waves, dancing alongside a variety of fish like crabs, lobsters, and crayfish. The scene was filled with joy and determination. The fish followed the sweet sounds, creating a mesmerizing spectacle. Even the John-dories and hake joined in the lively dance. The mackerel soared like rainbows, and the whiting and haddock left their watery homes to partake in the festivities. The atmosphere was vibrant with sprats, herrings, and ling, making the shore crowded. Amidst all this revelry, a beautiful young woman, as radiant as the dawn, appeared. She wore a cocked hat, had green hair like the sea, and a gown adorned with seaweeds. She danced with Maurice, a blind piper, charming him with her enchanting voice. Maurice, under the influence of drink, reciprocated her advances with witty verses. As the dance continued, Maurice's mother, distressed, pleaded with him to return.

A year later, a charred piece of wood washed ashore in Trafraska. It was an odd gift from Maurice, retrieved from the sea depths. While a gown or shoes would have been more practical for his mother, Maurice had promised and kept sending the burnt wood every year for over a century. The exact day is now forgotten, leading people to believe Maurice had ceased the tradition.

After the meal, the beggar asked to sleep in the stable, where he overheard a conversation between the animals about hidden treasures guarded by magical plants. The beggar set out to find these plants, eventually discovering them just in time. Armed with the plants, he returned to the village on New Year's Eve, ready to unearth the treasures beneath the stones on Plouhinec heath.|"['1.

A kind woman gave Peronnik some bread, and he ate it all. A knight arrived, revealing the magical power of a basin and a diamond lance, kept by a magician named Rogear. The knight planned to challenge Rogear for these treasures. The knight explained the dangerous path he must take, facing enchantments and trials like a fiery needle and a laughing flower guarded by a lion. Peronnik agreed to tend the knight's cattle. While doing so, he encountered the giant Rogear several times, growing more determined to acquire the magical items. One day, a wizard named Bryak appeared and shared a secret spell to navigate the enchanted woods.|"['1.

Peronnik refrained from sharing his recent escapade at the farm, knowing that to reach Kerglas, he first needed to capture the colt that held the way. Lacking the wizard's magic words and unable to draw the required circles, he pondered all day while tending cows, devising a plan to summon the colt. As night fell, he readied himself by mending an old halter, crafting a rope and net, and preparing a lure of crumbs and assorted items. Concealed near the path the mare and colt frequented, Peronnik enticed the colt with bread crumbs. The colt, enticed by the treat, fell into Peronnik's trap. Riding the colt, they ventured into the forest, encountering surreal obstacles. Emerging into a plain, the enchantments ceased, and they reached a park where a fairy man guarded an apple tree. Peronnik, claiming to be a bird-catcher on a mission for the magician, convinced the fairy man to let them pass.|"['1.

Peronnik outsmarted the korigan by trapping him in a net meant for birds. As he continued his journey, he encountered a lion with a mane of vipers. Peronnik cleverly tricked the lion by offering a bag filled with feathers and glue, which trapped the lion's head. He then used a flower that makes people laugh to escape. Next, he faced dragons in a lake, defeating them by feeding them magical beads. Finally, he approached a black man with six eyes, who was guarding a valley.

The king's son was to marry that very night, and his bride was summoned. Three daughters appeared, all in green silk with golden circlets. The son searched for the youngest, noticing the middle one's missing finger. The giant approved and warned the bride of danger. The wedding was grand with giants and guests dancing till morning.

Sadly, I journeyed down the hill once more, feeling immense shame when I passed the glade where I encountered the black man. That night, I stayed at the castle, receiving hospitality without questions about my adventures. The following morning, I found a bay horse waiting for me, and after arming myself, I returned to my court. The horse remains with me still, a cherished possession.

Once upon a time, a stag led Arthur's men to the wise owl of Cwm Cawlwyd and the eagle of Gwern Abbey in search of Mabon. The owl and the eagle, though ancient, did not know of Mabon's whereabouts. The eagle spoke of a rock he once perched on, now reduced to a mere stump, and of his encounter with a salmon at Llyn Llyw. The salmon, carrying Kai and Gwrhyr, led them to Gloucester, where Mabon was found imprisoned. Arthur's warriors stormed the castle and freed Mabon. Gwythyr, in a different tale, saved ants from a burning heather, and in return, they brought flax seed needed for Yspaddaden Penkawr. Arthur and his knights faced Trwyth the boar to retrieve a comb, scissors, and a razor. After a fierce battle, Arthur triumphed, driving the boar into the sea, its fate unknown.|"[""1.
