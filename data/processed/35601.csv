"Franz Liszt, a renowned musician, was not only a talented pianist but also a skilled conductor. As depicted in Picture No. 12, Liszt's presence at the piano was captivating. However, his role at the conductor's stand was equally impressive. With a baton in hand and the musical score on the desk, Liszt commanded the orchestra with precision. His conducting style was so captivating that the orchestra members closely followed his every gesture and expression, ensuring they played according to his vision.

One notable individual who received significant support from Liszt was the composer Richard Wagner, known for operas like ""Parsifal"" and ""The Flying Dutchman."" Initially, Wagner was hesitant about Liszt, but over time, their friendship blossomed, leading Wagner to acknowledge Liszt's profound impact on his artistic journey.
