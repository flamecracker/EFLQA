They stayed close by and had signals set up with Bud for help if needed. They would occasionally return to Bud, who was fixing his airplane model, before exploring the woods and swamp. Hugh learned a lot from Ralph, a knowledgeable companion. They cooked lunch and Bud worked on his model. The boys had hearty appetites, quickly devouring Ralph's delicious flapjacks. They enjoyed camp life and made more discoveries in the afternoon. Ralph shared stories of his past adventures, including finding a beehive in a fallen tree. He explained how he tracked the bees to the hive using a clever method. Hugh was impressed by Ralph's skills and resourcefulness.|['1.

Two scouts, eager for adventure, spent a lively afternoon investigating. As the sun began to set, Bud called them home.

All the scouts strained their eyes to spot a discovery. They listened to the rattle of the engine or propeller to follow an unseen object circling swiftly. They gazed up at the moving object, resembling a bat in the dim light. The sound of the machinery grew louder. Bud was perplexed by the noise he heard the previous night, asking if it was the mills miles away. Suddenly, a crash and flash stunned them. The object vanished, and voices nearby suggested excitement. They discussed the possibility of a meteor shower and planned to investigate in the morning. Hugh pondered deeply about the mysterious nightly aeroplane and the strange occurrences. They decided to head back inside as the fireworks seemed to be over for the night.|['1.

Bud sat quietly, lost in thought about the recent strange events that had unfolded. His friends seemed uninterested in the mysterious voices they had heard after a loud noise. Bud mentioned how foreign and incomprehensible the voices sounded, and Hugh suggested that the men in the speeding monoplane were not the same as the ones they heard. Ralph pointed out that the voices seemed to come from the same level as their location, accompanied by the sounds of men moving through the brush in a panic. The trio eventually settled down to sleep, with Bud falling asleep quickly, while Hugh harbored suspicions that he kept to himself. The next morning, the scouts woke to a clear sky, ready for another day of adventure. Bud was eager to explore the area where the meteor had landed before they headed home. The downhill journey back was a relief, and they anticipated a quicker return. Bud, excited for the day's plans, hurried through breakfast to begin his exploration.|['1.

The three boys set out from the shack in a fan formation towards the west, convinced the crash came from that direction. They signaled each other with calls and Wolf signals. After some time, Bud's shout led them to a shattered sapling near a massive crater caused by an explosion. They speculated it could be a new explosive or a meteor. The patrol leader mentioned the possibility of aerial experiments by the government or a company. As they discussed the potential impact of such explosives in warfare, a man in khaki appeared, adding to the conversation.|"['1.

Bud was speechless, but the officer saw a wide smile on his face, showing his immense happiness. Bud had always dreamt of flying in one of the busy airships soaring through the skies, and now, unexpectedly, his dream was coming true.

Hugh did not wake Bud from his happy dream. It was better to let him enjoy it a bit longer before facing the truth. Bud would soon realize he was too late, as the Wright brothers had already achieved the same feat with their aircraft. The group was relieved to be near their destination after a tiring journey.

The Flying Corps camp appeared on the horizon. A challenge from a sentry and the whispered countersign from the lieutenant indicated they were in a military camp. These seasoned soldiers were aviators and part of the Flying Squadron. Lieutenant Fosdick lent the boys glasses to observe a distant aeroplane performing daring maneuvers. Bud was amazed by the loops and flips, expressing his astonishment. The officer explained the risks they take daily and how familiarity with danger makes them resilient.

Hugh mentioned that it would be a while before any of them decided on their future. He believed that even Bud, despite his current enthusiasm for the Flying Squadron, might change his mind multiple times before making a final decision. Hugh expressed his gratitude for meeting the Lieutenant and eagerly anticipated flying with him. They observed the monoplane climbing high and making large curves, with the pilot avoiding risky maneuvers due to Bud's presence.

The tall man fired his automatic revolver wildly, hoping to deter the pursuing air pilot. The shots sounded like toy firecrackers to Hugh, who heard nothing as the bullets missed.
