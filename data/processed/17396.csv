When Mary Lennox arrived at Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle, everyone thought she was the most unpleasant-looking child they had ever seen. She had a thin face and body, light hair, and a sour expression. Born in India, she was often ill. Her parents were too busy and unwell to care for her, leaving her with an Ayah who kept her out of sight to please her mother. Mary grew up spoiled and selfish. Her English governesses couldn't handle her, and even the Ayah refused to come when Mary threw a tantrum. That morning, a mysterious atmosphere hung over the manor. Native servants were missing, and Mary was left alone as a strange young officer visited her mother. Soon, the truth emerged: cholera had struck, causing chaos and death.|"[""1.

On the second day, amidst the chaos, Mary hid in the nursery, forgotten by everyone. She felt lonely and scared, hearing strange noises and cries.

A familiar officer entered, surprised to see her. Mary, hungry and neglected, stood there feeling unloved and ignored.|['1.

Mary, a lonely girl, had never felt like she belonged anywhere, even when her parents were alive. She pondered why she never felt like anyone's little girl. Despite having servants and necessities, no one paid attention to her. Unaware that she was disagreeable, she thought others were. Mrs. Medlock, whom she found disagreeable, escorted her to Yorkshire. Mary tried to distance herself from Mrs. Medlock, not wanting to be associated with her. Mrs. Medlock, undisturbed by Mary's thoughts, was determined to follow Mr. Craven's orders. Mr. Craven, Mary's guardian, summoned her after the death of her aunt and uncle. Mary, looking plain and fretful, sat quietly during the journey, catching Mrs. Medlock's attention.

"Mrs. Medlock agreed, ""You're right. It doesn't matter. I don't know why you're at Misselthwaite Manor, maybe it's just the easiest option. Mr. Craven won't bother about you, that's for sure. He never bothers about anyone."" Despite trying not to care, Mary glanced at her. The thought of the hunchback being married surprised her. Mrs. Medlock noticed and continued, finding it a way to pass the time. She shared a story about Mr. Craven's late wife, how he cared for her deeply. When she passed away, it affected him greatly. He isolates himself in the West Wing, only allowing Pitcher to see him. Mary felt a sense of melancholy, picturing the dreariness of the mansion with locked rooms and a secluded man.

Mrs. Medlock advised Mary not to expect to meet Mr. Craven and to be prepared to entertain herself. She was warned not to wander around the house without permission. Mary, feeling less sorry for Mr. Craven, gazed at the rainy landscape from the train. Mrs. Medlock bought lunch, and they ate in the carriage. The rain intensified, and everyone at the station wore rain gear. Mary dozed off, woke up in the dark, and helped Mrs. Medlock with their belongings. They arrived at a small station where a brougham awaited them. Mary was intrigued by the journey to the mysterious manor. Mrs. Medlock mentioned they would cross Missel Moor before reaching the Manor. Mary observed the passing village and countryside through the window as they drove along in the night.|"['1.

The carriage slowed down as if going uphill, the darkness outside enveloping everything. Through the window, Mary saw only blackness. The carriage jolted, casting light on a rough road cutting through bushes. Mrs. Medlock explained they were crossing wild land with heather, gorse, and wild animals. The wind howled as they drove through the dark, passing bridges with rushing water below. Finally, they reached a vast house with dimly lit windows. Inside, a massive oak door led to a dimly lit hall filled with portraits and suits of armor. Mary felt small and odd in the grand space. Led through corridors, she found a room with tapestry-covered walls depicting a forest. The room felt curious and gloomy, with a view of endless land outside. The housemaid's noisy fire-starting woke Mary, who marveled at the unique room.|['1.

"Mary was puzzled by Martha's demeanor. The servants in India were subservient, addressing their masters with respect and never daring to speak as equals.

"The dressing lesson was eye-opening for Martha and Mary. Martha was used to taking care of her younger siblings, but she was surprised by Mary's passivity, as if she couldn't dress herself. Martha chalked it up to ""custom,"" a phrase the native servants often used to justify their actions. Mary, on the other hand, realized that her life at Misselthwaite Manor would be a learning experience. She observed Martha's chatter about her large family and their simple moorland life, where the children played freely and even had a young pony.

Mary was told she would have to learn to play alone, like Dickon, a boy who made friends with animals on the moor. Intrigued by the idea, Mary set out to explore the gardens. She passed through a gate into a vast garden with lawns, trees, and a pool. However, the flower-beds were empty, and the fountain was still. She then noticed a long wall covered in ivy, with a green door standing open. Curious, she approached the door, unaware that it led to the kitchen gardens where vegetables and fruits grew.

Mary walked through the door into a garden surrounded by walls, one of many walled gardens that seemed interconnected. She noticed another open green door leading to pathways between beds of winter vegetables. Fruit-trees were trained against the walls with glass frames over some beds. Despite the bare and unattractive appearance, Mary explored further. An old man with a spade appeared, looking surprised and somewhat unfriendly. Undeterred, Mary continued through a second green door, finding more walled gardens with winter vegetables and glass frames. She then encountered a closed green door that might lead to a garden unseen for years.

Pondering her appearance, she wondered if she was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and if she appeared as sour. The thought of having a bad temper made her uneasy. Suddenly, a melodious sound broke the silence, and turning around, she saw a robin perched on an apple tree singing. Surprisingly, she addressed the robin with a soft and inviting tone, catching Ben Weatherstaff off guard. He chuckled, mentioning a boy named Dickon who seemed to have a special connection with nature. Mary wanted to learn more but was interrupted as the robin flew away. Ben urged her not to pry into matters that didn't concern her and went back to work. Mary's routine changed when she started exploring the moor, unknowingly benefiting from the fresh air and exercise, which invigorated her body and brightened her complexion."|"['1.

After spending several days outdoors, Mary woke up one morning feeling hungry. Instead of pushing her breakfast away, she eagerly ate her porridge until her bowl was empty. Martha, noticing Mary's newfound appetite, attributed it to the fresh air of the moor. Martha also warned Mary about the importance of having both food and hunger, unlike some who lacked food despite having the appetite. Mary explored the gardens and paths in the park, occasionally looking for Ben Weatherstaff, who seemed too preoccupied to notice her. One place Mary frequented was a long walk outside the walled gardens, where she noticed neglected ivy. While observing a spray of ivy, Mary encountered Ben Weatherstaff's friendly robin redbreast, who chirped and sang to her, making Mary feel understood and appreciated.|"[""1.

"She hurried along the pathway to the green door she had entered on her first morning. After passing through another door and into the orchard, she gazed up to see the tree on the opposite side of the wall, where a robin was finishing his song. Walking around the orchard wall, she found no door. She then explored the ivy-covered wall outside, finding no entrance. This new environment at Misselthwaite Manor awakened her curiosity, unlike the hot and languid days in India. The cool moor wind cleared her mind, and she enjoyed being outdoors all day.

Mary was experiencing some wonderful things at Misselthwaite Manor. She had connected with a robin, felt the wind warm her blood, experienced a healthy hunger, and learned to empathize with others. As she listened to the wind one day, she heard a strange sound that seemed like a child crying. The sound was inside the house, not outside. Suddenly, a door downstairs opened, causing a rush of air that blew open the room's door, extinguishing the light. The crying sound grew louder as a distant door slammed shut. Martha, Mary's companion, quickly closed the door and locked it. Martha shared stories about her family, including her brother Dickon, who rescued animals. Mary found Martha's tales fascinating and felt a connection to the warmth and coziness of Martha's family stories.|"['1.

Mary decided not to ask about the library's location. Instead, a new idea inspired her to search for it on her own. Unconcerned about Mrs. Medlock, who stayed in her comfortable room downstairs, Mary explored the mansion. The place was mostly empty, with only the servants around. Mary's meals were served without much attention to her, unlike in India where she had constant care. One day, she heard about the library, which made her curious about the locked rooms in the mansion. With no one to stop her, Mary started counting the doors in the long corridor. The walls were adorned with portraits of people in elaborate attire, making Mary wonder about their stories. She felt a connection with the children in the paintings and imagined their lives. Mary's exploration led her to a gallery filled with portraits, sparking her imagination about the house's history.|"[""1.

One peculiar morning, a little girl found herself exploring a vast, empty house all alone. As she roamed through the corridors and rooms, she felt as though she was the only one who had ever been there. The rooms were filled with old pictures, tapestries, and unique furniture. In a room with embroidered velvet hangings, she discovered a cabinet holding a collection of miniature ivory elephants. Fascinated, she played with them for a while before carefully arranging them back in the cabinet. While she had seen no signs of life in the house, she encountered a little gray mouse and her six babies nesting in a cushion. Tired from her explorations, she made her way back, occasionally getting lost in the maze-like corridors. As she stood pondering her location, a faint cry interrupted the silence, a sound that hinted at another presence in the mysterious house.|['1.

She accidentally touched the tapestry and jumped back, surprised. The tapestry covered a door that opened to reveal another part of the corridor. Mrs. Medlock approached, looking cross, warning her to stay put or face being locked up. Mary realized she needed a governess as promised. The rain had cleared, unveiling a bright blue sky over the moor. Martha explained how the storm signaled the arrival of spring.

Mary felt more isolated than ever once Martha had left. She hurried into the garden, circling the fountain flower garden ten times to lift her spirits. The sunlight altered the entire atmosphere. The vast, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite just as it did over the moor, and she kept gazing up, envisioning what it would be like to recline on one of the small, snow-white clouds and drift about. She ventured into the initial kitchen garden and found Ben Weatherstaff toiling there with two other gardeners. The change in weather appeared to"|"[""1.

Mary discovered a key in the garden while the robin was hunting for worms. The key seemed old and rusty, buried in the freshly turned soil. She thought it might unlock the hidden door to the closed garden on the estate.

Living in a large, lonely house with many locked rooms, Mary's discovery sparked her imagination.

Martha excitedly shared her day's adventures with her family after a fun day out. She had baked treats and made dough-cakes for the children, filling their cottage with delicious smells.

Ben complimented Mary on her skipping skills, noting how the curious robin followed her around.

Mary took a deep breath and peered back along the path to check for any approaching figures, but no one was in sight. The door creaked open slowly as she pushed aside the ivy curtain, revealing a mysterious and enchanting garden. The walls were covered with leafless climbing roses, creating a dense, tangled maze. The ground was blanketed in wintry brown grass, with rose bushes scattered throughout. The climbing roses intertwined with the trees, forming delicate, swaying curtains and bridges between them. The garden's atmosphere was unlike any other Mary had experienced, with a hazy tangle of branches creating an air of mystique. As she moved through the garden, the robin followed her, chirping and flitting from bush to bush. Despite the silence and solitude, Mary did not feel lonely.

Mistress Mary walked slowly through the garden, carefully observing the green points emerging from the ground. Despite her lack of gardening knowledge, she felt compelled to clear space for the plants to thrive. With a sharp piece of wood, she weeded and created breathing room for the delicate shoots.

Mary sat by the fire, contemplating her secret garden. She knew she must be cautious to keep it hidden from Mr. Craven, as he would surely lock it away forever if he discovered it. Feeling lonely in the vast, empty estate, she longed for a little garden of her own. Martha, the maid, suggested she could buy a garden set with a spade, rake, and fork for two shillings at the shop in Thwaite village.

In the garden, Colin's hands shook as he placed a rose in the soil with the help of old Ben. Mary watched, while Soot and the birds observed from a cherry tree. With Dickon's assistance and the garden's magic, Colin gained strength. As the sun set, he stood on his own, laughing. Dr. Craven, waiting at the house, was relieved to see them return.

Ben Weatherstaff mentioned that the late Mistress Craven adored plants that reached for the sky, finding joy in the blue expanse above. The seeds sown by Dickon and Mary flourished magically, with vibrant poppies swaying cheerfully and roses blooming abundantly, enchanting the garden. Colin, confined to his bed, reveled in the garden's transformation, observing each delicate change. He marveled at the growth of buds and the intricate activities of insects. Fascinated by nature's wonders, he embraced the newfound world unfolding before him. Colin, inspired by Mary's tales of magic, believed in the power of positive thoughts to manifest good things.

The remarkable scientific revelations I aim to uncover will revolve around Magic. Magic remains a profound enigma known to only a select few, hidden in ancient tomes and partially understood by Mary due to her upbringing in India among fakirs. I suspect Dickon possesses a latent grasp of Magic, evident in his ability to captivate animals and people. Magic, I believe, permeates everything, waiting for us to harness its power like we do with electricity and steam. When Mary unearthed this garden, it appeared lifeless, yet nature began to flourish miraculously. This phenomenon piqued my scientific curiosity. I am resolved to adopt a scientific mindset, always questioning and seeking answers. Magic is the force behind the growth of plants, the flight of birds, and the vitality in all living beings. It surrounds us, waiting to be embraced. Let us embark on this experiment together, invoking Magic to empower us and instill strength.|"['1.

If you keep practicing something every day, like soldiers going through drill, we'll see what happens. Learning involves repetition and deep thought. Just like with Magic, if you keep calling on it, it becomes a part of you. Ben Weatherstaff dryly mentioned how words can have consequences, like Jem Fettleworth's wife calling him names leading to a fight. Magic can be powerful but must be used wisely. Colin asked Dickon if the experiment would work, curious about his thoughts. They gathered in a circle, feeling a sense of mystery and majesty. Colin began a chant, feeling the Magic within and around them all, including the creatures drawn to their circle.

"""They are plumpin' up,"" Dickon observed. ""They're so hungry they can't stop talking about it. Master Colin keeps asking for more food, and they might not believe he's an invalid at all. Miss Mary offered to share her food, but he insists that they both need to gain weight at the same time.""

""I have an idea to help them,"" Mrs. Sowerby chimed in. ""In the mornings, you can take them a pail of fresh milk, and I'll bake them some delicious bread or buns with currants.

Colin's health was improving remarkably, and the doctor was pleased with his progress. However, Colin was adamant about not wanting his father to be informed, fearing disappointment if his condition worsened. He expressed his frustration, feeling hot and angry at the mere thought of letters being sent to his father. Despite his improving health, Colin was still easily agitated and prone to tantrums if provoked. He even contemplated eating less to maintain his progress. Each morning, he and Mary would share a hearty breakfast, but Colin felt it was too much for someone who might be dying.

"In the hidden garden, miracles bloomed daily. A robin guarded its nest, where Eggs lay waiting, warmed by its mate's careful wings. The robin, wary at first, soon sensed a shared understanding with the garden's visitors. Dickon, who spoke the robin's language, was welcomed without hesitation. The robin watched Mary and Colin closely, but trusted Dickon instantly. The boy's unique movements initially puzzled the robin, but as he learned to walk, the bird realized he was simply learning to ""fly"" on his own two feet.

After some time, the boy began to mimic the movements of the other children, but their actions were peculiar. They would stand under the trees, flailing their arms, legs, and heads in a manner that was not quite walking, running, or sitting. These strange exercises were performed daily, puzzling a robin who observed them. The robin, unable to comprehend their actions, found comfort in the fact that the boy, who could communicate with robins, was partaking in the activities. Unlike humans who need special exercises to stay fit, robins naturally develop their muscles through daily activities like flying for food.

As soon as Mary had made sure that John was really on his way back to his own quarters below stairs, Colin got out of his chair.

""All these,"" said Colin, ""must be my relations. They lived a long time ago. That parrot one, I believe, is one of my great, great, great, great aunts. She looks rather like you, Mary--not as you look now but as you looked when you came here. Now you are a great deal fatter and better looking.""

They went to the Indian room and amused themselves with the ivory elephants. They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and the hole in the cushion the mouse had left but the mice had grown up and run away and the hole was empty. They saw more rooms and made more discoveries than Mary had made on her first pilgrimage. They found new corridors and corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they liked and weird old things they did not know the use of."|"['1.

"""I enjoy doing this,"" he said, ""because when I'm older and make important scientific discoveries, I'll have to give lectures about them. This is practice for that. Right now, my lectures are short since I'm young, and Ben Weatherstaff would get bored and fall asleep if they were too long."" But when Colin spoke under his tree, old Ben watched him intently, filled with affection. It wasn't just the lecture that caught his attention but also the boy's improving posture, healthier appearance, and brightening eyes. Colin often wondered what Ben was thinking, especially when the old man seemed deeply impressed. One morning, Dickon arrived too late to hear the lecture. He was flushed from running, his face even more cheerful than usual. They got to weeding after the rain, a task made necessary by the weeds flourishing alongside the flowers. Colin excelled at weeding now and could talk while working. ""Magic works best when you work yourself,"" he remarked. ""You can feel it in your bones and muscles. I plan to read about bones and muscles but write a book about Magic. I'm creating it now. I keep discovering new things."" Soon after saying this, Colin stood up, a sudden realization dawning on him.

"Dickon was simple and genuine. He grasped Colin's feelings better than Colin himself, almost instinctively. He removed his cap, still smiling. Colin followed suit, feeling the sun warm his hair as he observed Dickon closely. Ben Weatherstaff, puzzled, also bared his head, unsure why. They sang a song, praising God and the magic around them. Colin pondered the similarity between the two. They sang again, with Mary and Colin's voices harmonizing beautifully, and Dickon's voice rising powerfully.

"Susan Sowerby, Ben Weatherstaff said, pointing to the boy's legs. ""They were like drumsticks in stockings two months ago, and folks said they were crooked. Look at them now!""

Together, they couldn't contain their laughter, especially as they struggled to keep up the pretense of Colin's illness. They eagerly planned a visit to Mary's cottage, envisioning a day of adventure and exploration. As they chatted, Colin gazed at Susan Sowerby with admiration, holding onto her cloak as if in awe.

He fell asleep without realizing it and slipped into a dream that felt incredibly real. In his dream, he heard a distant, sweet, and happy voice calling out to him. The dream felt so vivid that he was convinced he was awake. When he finally woke up to a bright morning, a servant handed him a letter from Yorkshire. The letter was from Susan Sowerby, who had spoken to him once on the moor about Miss Mary. Susan urged him to come home, mentioning that his lady would want him to return. This letter sparked memories of his son, whom he had neglected for years. Despite his initial reluctance to think about his son, memories flooded back. He recalled the guilt he felt for not being a good father and avoiding his son's presence.

As the train journeyed through mountain passes and golden plains, a man who felt a new sense of awakening began to ponder deeply. Unfamiliar with the concept of Magic, he wondered if Susan Sowerby had reached out to him out of concern for the boy's worsening health.

He made an effort to return to where he stood, feeling grounded on earth again. Exiting the room, he followed Mary's path through the door in the shrubbery, passing by the fountain and autumn flowers.
