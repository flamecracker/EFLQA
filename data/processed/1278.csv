In London once more, you find Francesca, Salemina, and me. Salemina, a Boston philanthropist, is in her forties. I am an artist. Francesca, almost twenty, is a bit of a mystery, simply a nice girl for now. She's yet to grasp the concept of personal responsibility. Francesca is in love, rich, while Salemina is well-off, and I, poor. We're back at Smith's private hotel in Mayfair, a place that tempts you to overspend. I always consider giving up art for a hotel business, but I lack the heart to overcharge like they do here. Francesca tries to tackle the bill, creating confusion with her columns. Salemina takes over, clarifying the expenses with the butler's help. Dawson, our butler, uncovers every error, showing us our misunderstandings. Despite the billing chaos, we appreciate the hotel's kindness, like not charging for breakfast trays.|"['1.

The Paid Out column can cause a lot of stress. Francesca often spends money unexpectedly, sending things home C.O.D., taking cabs, and sending messages. She creates chaos and excitement as if the country were on the brink of war. When she reviews her expenses, she gets flustered, exclaiming about telegrams and cab rides she didn't recall. Her friends help her untangle the bills, correcting errors and estimating their shares. Salemina, being very English, handles the accounts meticulously. She manages with precision, even though she's not perfect to the penny. Francesca and her friends are grateful for Salemina's expertise, even though her English ways sometimes puzzle them. They appreciate her attention to detail, even if it means a bit of extra work to settle the bill.|"['1.

Salemina quickly adapted to English customs upon her arrival, showing no pretense or prior training. Her patriotism swelled when meeting the Princess of Wales, feeling at home in the foggy air. In contrast, the English butlers struck fear in the narrator, who struggled to assert herself in their presence. At a private hotel, the butler's formality stifled casual conversation. The footmen's behavior seemed less rigid during the London season, prompting observations of their occasional movements. The powdered footmen maintained superior rigidity compared to those without powder, indicating a lack of humor was essential in their role. The narrator feared what these footmen might become when off duty. During a visit to Marjorimallow Hall, the trio prepared to impress with their best attire, knowledge, and talents, but encounters at the table did not go as planned.|"['1.

Three days before our trip, I mentioned at breakfast that we must learn to eat boiled eggs neatly. We struggled with this at our current place, but at Marjorimallow Hall, we couldn't avoid them. We decided to practice with soft-boiled eggs daily, away from Dawson. We even had a fine system for mistakes. The second day showed improvement, but Francesca struggled due to a sleepless night. Salemina and I managed better. On the third day, we succeeded. However, during breakfast at Marjorimallow Hall, a mishap occurred, leading to a humorous moment. Despite the mishap, we learned that the English appreciate a good joke. It made me realize the futility of stereotyping nations. The English may not joke as frequently as Americans, but they enjoy humor when they encounter it.|"['1.

One young Englishman I recently met tends to over-appreciate things. He laughs excessively before, during, and after every comment I make, except when I ask for food or drink. This person is a friend of Willie Beresford, named the Honourable Arthur Ponsonby. He accompanied us on a coach ride to Dorking, a charming town famous for its hens. Salemina suggested I sit next to him, hoping he would entertain me. Unfortunately, he drained me of ideas without offering any in return. Conversing with a coach enthusiast when I know little about horses proved challenging. Eventually, the Honourable Arthur realized I was trying to be friendly, which improved our interaction. We even got along so well that Willie Beresford became gloomy, making me question if it was due to Francesca's absence. The English street names, like Pie, Pudding, and Petticoat Lanes, never fail to amuse me. At one point, we passed through 'Prudent Passage,' leading to 'Huggin Lane,' a contrast that puzzled Willie Beresford. Despite his mother's scolding for his comment, the Honourable Arthur found my joke about the 'Goat's Milk Company, Limited' hilarious. This incident led to many joyful moments and smiles during our time together.|"['1.

In the park, various speakers entertained the crowd with their unique styles. One speaker, hoping for pennies, gave a humorous twist to a play with a Yorkshire accent. Another, an Irishman, faced a quarrelsome Scot who challenged his every word. Meanwhile, a Cockney lad shared his negative experiences with the Salvation Army. Religious and temperance groups also voiced their opinions, but there were no Anarchists or Socialists that day. Amidst it all, an old man with a tattered book captivated children with stories. And in a different scene, public lovers in the park displayed a calm and duty-bound affection, impervious to onlookers. Their indifference to public scrutiny was a curious study in itself, showing a unique form of self-assuredness.|"['1.

One of my most memorable English encounters was when I unexpectedly met the Duke of Cimicifugas. The Duchess of Cimicifugas, known for her grace and charm, is close friends with Mrs. Apis Mellifica. Mrs. Apis Mellifica, who is said to have a substantial income, often exchanges gifts with the duchess. During a visit to Cimicifugas House, I accompanied Mrs. Apis Mellifica's daughter, Hilda, to see some rare tapestries being hung as a birthday surprise for the duchess. While exploring the grand estate, we were informed that the Duke would join us for tea. Nervous about meeting nobility, I fretted over the proper etiquette and how to address him. However, to my surprise, when the Duke approached us, he appeared to be a humble and unassuming man.|"['Question 1: Who is close friends with the Duchess of Cimicifugas?\nA) Mrs. Asteraceae\nB) Mrs. Brassicaceae\nC) Mrs. Caryophyllaceae\nD) Mrs. Dianthus\nE) Mrs. Apis Mellifica', 'Question 2: What was being hung as a birthday surprise for the duchess at Cimicifugas House?\nA) Paintings\nB) Sculptures\nC) Tapestries\nD) Rugs\nE) Photographs', ""Question 3: Who did the narrator accompany to Cimicifugas House?\nA) Mrs. Solanaceae\nB) Mrs. Rosaceae\nC) Mrs. Lamiaceae\nD) Mrs. Fabaceae\nE) Mrs. Apis Mellifica's daughter, Hilda"", 'Question 4: What were the narrator and Hilda going to see at Cimicifugas House?\nA) Rare books\nB) Antique furniture\nC) Historical artifacts\nD) Rare tapestries\nE) Fine china', 'Question 5: How did the narrator feel about meeting the Duke of Cimicifugas?\nA) Excited\nB) Anxious\nC) Indifferent\nD) Curious\nE) Happy', 'Question 6: How did the Duke of Cimicifugas appear to the narrator when they finally met?\nA) Arrogant\nB) Humble and unassuming\nC) Distant\nD) Rude\nE) Intimidating']"|"['E) Mrs. Apis Mellifica', 'C) Tapestries', ""E) Mrs. Apis Mellifica's daughter, Hilda"", 'D) Rare tapestries', 'B) Anxious', 'B) Humble and unassuming']"
The Duke of Cimicifugas, Hilda, and I attended a grand event. As I faced the Duke, memories of historical events flooded my mind. Hilda and I conversed with the Duke and Lady Veratrum. Hilda spoke politely, while I remained silent, following Pythagoras' teachings. My plan was to observe the Duke silently. Dukes in England are scarce, and Francesca, an American friend, seeks one. London's vastness overwhelms us, from its wealth to its poverty. Riding atop a bus offers a unique view of the city. Trams and buses take us to various places, each with its charm. Exploring the absorbed villages and bustling markets on a Saturday evening reveals different facets of London life. The Thames at night sparkles with lights, a sight to behold.|"[""1.

When venturing out into the misty streets of London, one may find themselves engulfed in a 'London particular,' a term used to describe a dense fog by Mr. Guppy. Sitting atop a Lipton's Tea 'bus, one embarks on a journey through a world of shifting shadows where everything appears eerie, indistinct, and shrouded in grey. The looming shapes vanish as quickly as they emerge, with the heavy sky seeming to press down upon you, while the air is tinged with a luminous yellow haze. While we opt for the Lipton's Tea 'bus due to its visibility in such weather, it may not be the ideal choice for those seeking specific destinations promptly. To decipher the routes and destinations of buses accurately, one must focus on the narrow horizontal signs along the sides rather than the prominent ones on top.

Francesca and her friend were strolling through London, reminiscing about their knowledge of England gained from Dickens's novels. They passed by Buckingham Street, where Alfred Jingle's lodgings were, and thanked Mr. Pickwick for the insights into London. Despite critics dismissing Dickens's work, his stories have enriched the understanding of England for many, especially children in America. The streets of London are teeming with imaginary characters and shades of literary figures, making a walk or bus ride essential to truly experience the city. Leigh Hunt's idea of mapping literary London resonates, as each spot is imbued with the presence of famous writers. Francesca, engrossed in searching for old silver pieces, had a comical encounter with silver-sellers, requiring a rescue operation by her friends. Later, they opted for a cozy indoor tea time due to drizzling weather, enjoying a spread of tea, strawberries, and cream by the fire.|"[""1.

“Yes,” I said firmly, “we will permit you to stay; however, since you are joining us for dinner, I believe you will have to leave at some point, if only to prepare to return. You've been here since breakfast.”“I am aware,” he replied calmly, “and my only mistake was not having breakfast earlier to begin my day here sooner. One must seize a moment when possible nowadays; as these rooms are so filled with British elites that an American of lower birth has little opportunity!”Now I wonder if Willie Beresford loves Francesca. What should I do--or rather, what should we do--if he does, while she loves someone else? Perhaps she desires one lover for foreign affairs and another for domestic matters. He is too old for her, but that is always the case. When Alcides, after enduring all the trials of life, took a bride in Olympus, he should have chosen Minerva, yet he picked Hebe.|"['1.

Francesca and I turned off the gas completely, even though we had been sitting in dim light all evening. We put on our dressing gowns and sat by the window once more, taking a final look at the past, present, and future of the 'Brighthelmston set.' At midnight, an elegant lady arrived, who appeared to be a dowager duchess. She was adorned with extravagant black tulle and diamonds, resembling a walking map. The arrival of this grand lady caused a stir among the guests, adding glamour to the already fashionable event. A notable elderly gentleman arrived later, greeted with deep bows from the servants. Lord Brighthelmston brought Patricia and Terence out to the balcony, where the gentleman, likely Patricia's godfather, placed a string of pearls around her neck and kissed her forehead. Supper was served at one o'clock, with Francesca and I enjoying a spread of chicken galantine, cress sandwiches, and milk. The night was filled with music and dancing, with waltzes and lively tunes echoing through the streets.

In the cozy room with a single lamp lit, a group of friends gathered by the window, enjoying the evening. While some chatted and laughed, others sat quietly.

After settling my bill in Dovermarle Street, I realized my funds were low. Opting for a third-class journey to Belvern, I paid a shilling to ride backwards with seven frumpish yet respectable women. Their curious stares made me feel like a peculiar creature. At Oxford, buying plums caused a stir, with one woman suspecting me of foul play. Seeking lodgings in West Belvern, my driver was surprised by my request for a place with a purple clematis. Eventually, I settled at Holly House, despite the landlady's tongue-twisting name choice. The room was dearer than expected, but Mrs. Hobbs kindly offered a discount. A modest supper of eggs and ale followed, leaving me feeling a bit down as I retired for the night.|['1.

In my dream, I found myself in a New England garden, where childhood memories intertwined with fragrances and sounds. The voice in my dream spoke of choosing love over fame, power, or gold, as love is the purest force in the universe. It described how love brings new hopes and ambitions, like green shoots in the sun, and how life's pleasures are like singing birds nesting in branches. Yet, the serpent of Satiety can cause weariness. The garden of Life is never deserted, with modest flowers whispering peace, and angels comforting buried hopes. Belvern offers various choices, each with its own charm, nestled in the beautiful Belvern Hills. From their heights, one can see market towns, cathedrals, and rivers meandering through lush meadows. These hills and dales were once part of the Royal Forest and Chase of Belvern, covering vast acres across three counties.|"['1.

During the time of chivalry, the threat of a Spanish invasion was more thrilling than modern-day strikes.

In my cozy English abode, Mrs. Bobby ensures my meals arrive promptly, allowing me to focus on my painting.

Today, I ponder what to paint. Should it be the garden below my window, with its mix of flowers and vegetables, the cherry tree, the buzzing bees, and the scent of hay in the air, capturing the essence of midsummer in England? Or perhaps the Bobby baby picking wildflowers, the gorse bushes in bloom, or the clock tower down the lane? In my heart, I can paint these scenes vividly, feeling the warmth and beauty of summer. I wonder how great artists worked, if they paused for life's moments. Among the hills, donkey-chairs are common for visitors, like Jane, the steadfast donkey I met on my drives. Jane, with her iron will and tiny stature, is a force to be reckoned with, embodying strength and resilience.|"['1.

In the afternoon, Mrs. Bobby often asks where I am headed. I respond that I haven't decided, really waiting for Jane to make up her mind first. Jane always waits for me to choose so she can pick the opposite, just to be contrary. St. Bridget's Well is a lovely place I want to see, but Jane insists on going to Shady Dell Farm, her childhood home. Despite my wishes, Jane always veers left towards the farm. She seems to have a sentimental attachment to it. I've tried everything to persuade her, but she remains stubborn. One day, I plan to trick her by pretending to choose the left path, hoping she'll turn right towards the well. Jane's resistance to my plans remains a mystery, and I continue to strive for a visit to St. Bridget's Well.|"[""1.

This was my inspiration. Can you believe that it failed completely? It should have worked, and would have with a normal donkey, but Jane saw right through it. She followed my tug on the left rein and went to Shady Dell Farm as usual. Another odd thing about Jane is her strong dislike for baby carriages. As Belvern is a lovely, healthy place with a growing population, the streets are filled with baby carriages, some even carrying twins. Maneuvering Jane and the Bath 'cheer' through the narrow streets of Belvern without harming any babies is a challenging task. Despite Jane's tendency to lurch into one carriage while avoiding another, she prefers this risk over following the path I want her to take. I often wish I could understand Jane's thought process. Sometimes I believe she means well but is ignorant and dull. Other times, I think she doesn't understand me due to our different nationalities.

"""Mrs. Bobby,"" I said, as we discussed naming the cottage, ""let's name it 'Comfort Cottage.' It's unique and fitting for this lovely place. I'll paint a signboard with a steaming kettle and 'Tea Served Here' to attract visitors for afternoon tea in your beautiful garden. We can set up tables on the porch and under the yew tree, ensuring a delightful experience. This venture will help you earn extra money, especially when I'm here to assist. People enjoy new experiences, and I believe this will be a success. We must maintain high standards with clean tables, fresh flowers, and impeccable service.

The innkeeper was confident that their new tea station would attract thirsty customers passing by. Despite a mishap with a cow, the innkeeper quickly improvised and served tea to unexpected visitors.

I had a challenging task of calculating the cost of the teas served to nine guests. Initially priced at five shillings and three pence, I found it too low and adjusted it to six shillings and ten pence, adding extra charges for the children's teas. The temptation to include candle costs arose, but I resisted. One gentleman paid without hesitation and even tipped me. As they left, another gentleman and a nice young man generously tipped me. Later, a lady inquired about buying flowers. Though unsure of the prices, I confidently quoted a shilling for a canary. To my surprise, the canary turned out to be a non-singing one, leading to an exchange later. The group departed on char-a-bancs, and I offered the baby for sale but ended up giving the driver a cup of tea as a kind gesture.|"['1.

I finished clearing the tables before Mrs. Bobby returned, looking flushed and out of breath, with the guilty cow. I will always remember her surprise, her gentle scolding, her smiles, and even her tears as she checked my very British bill and accepted the payment. Nine cups of tea cost 3 shillings and 6 pence, cream was 7 pence, bread-and-butter was 1 shilling and 6 pence, extra teas were 9 pence, marmalade was 6 pence, three tips were 2 shillings, four roses and mignonette were 1 shilling and 8 pence, three carnations were 6 pence, a canary was 12 shillings, and a cage was 1 shilling, totaling 24 shillings.|['1.

I regretted placing the marmalade so low-priced at sixpence, but since it was untouched, it didn't matter much as the total cost for the gathering was only about a shilling. On that small investment, I thought one pound three shillings was a fair amount to earn for a beginner like myself, especially since I'm not English by birth. I attempted another nap after the excitement. I heard the gate open a few times, but the presence of a single stray customer after my hungry guests didn't pique my interest, and I drifted off into a pleasant dream. However, I was awoken by Mrs. Bobby's voice apologizing for disturbing me. She mentioned a customer at the yew-tree table who seemed peculiar, feeding tea to the flowers and playing with a dog and a baby. Mrs. Bobby was concerned about her silver cream-jug and the customer's extended stay.|"['1.
