Uncle Wiggily searched the floor for a tack but found only cookie crumbs. He attributed his pain to rheumatism, locating his crutch under the bed. Dr. Possum advised travel for fresh air and exercise. Uncle Wiggily agreed, whistling a tune. A voice from a hollow stump warned him of weak eyes. Uncle Wiggily invited the voice out, suspecting it to be Grandfather Goosey Gander or Uncle Butter. The voice claimed to cure diseases. Peering into the stump, Uncle Wiggily felt something furry.

Uncle Wiggily found himself trapped in a bear's den, facing a fierce bear ready to cook him. However, he remembered a rope his nephew had put in his bag.

"Hobbling with his crutch and carrying his bag, the elderly rabbit emerged from a dark cave and found himself by a peaceful brook. ""Much better than a bear's den!"" he chuckled. ""What a thrilling adventure! Sammie was clever with that cord. Now, fishing for fun sounds nice. I'll release any catch. I've got a lunch packed by Susie's mom."" After preparing his fishing gear, Uncle Wiggily cast his line and relaxed, pondering his next move. Suddenly, a tug on the line startled him.

Uncle Wiggily found himself in a tricky situation inside a funny little house in the woods with a clawy creature. He only had his barber-pole crutch and couldn't escape.

"""Stand still!"" commanded the two foxes in unison. One of them lunged towards Uncle Wiggily, but the brave rabbit swiftly extended his red-white-and-blue crutch, causing the fox to bite down on it instead. Momentarily safe, Uncle Wiggily was soon in peril again. Perplexed, he closed his eyes as instructed by Fido Flip-Flop, who then spun around rapidly, resembling a pinwheel or a speeding tire. The dizzying display continued as Fido chased his tail, leaving the foxes disoriented. With a narrow escape behind them, Uncle Wiggily and Fido fled through the woods, leaving the bewildered foxes in a daze.

Uncle Wiggily faced a dilemma but came up with a clever plan. He made a paper boat, complete with a sail, to cross the stream and sleep in a wooden house. As he sailed, the boat started to fall apart. Just as an alligator threatened him, a friendly goldfish rescued Uncle Wiggily. The goldfish carried him safely to shore, saving him from the alligator. Uncle Wiggily spent the night in the wooden house, dreaming of finding a gold dollar. The next morning, he heard stones hitting the door. To his relief, he discovered that the goldfish was throwing the stones as a friendly signal. Uncle Wiggily knew he was safe and went out to greet his aquatic friend.|"['1.

Uncle Wiggily, a kind rabbit, was on a journey when a fish offered him a strange breakfast. The fish wished him good luck and swam away. Suddenly, a snake tried to catch Uncle Wiggily, but he cleverly escaped over bushes, landing in a mud pie. Two hedgehog boys mistook him for a fox or bear. The boys helped Uncle Wiggily fend off the snake by throwing mud in its eyes. Grateful, Uncle Wiggily shared his cherry pie with the boys, and they all had a delightful time together.

Uncle Wiggily had a restless night at the hedgehog's house. The little porcupine boy, dreaming he was a rubber ball, rolled into Uncle Wiggily, leaving stickery-stickers on the rabbit. Then, the other hedgehog boy, dreaming he was a jumping jack, jumped on Uncle Wiggily, adding more stickers. Uncle Wiggily declined an offer to stay and make mud pies, hurrying off through hills and woods. Soon, he heard loud crying behind a rock. Expecting to find his nephew, he discovered a big elephant in distress. The elephant had a tack in his foot, causing him pain.

"The elephant shouted, ""No you won't! Uncle Wiggily is my friend!"" He used his trunk to splash water over the trees, leaving the alligator on dry land.

Uncle Wiggily and Grandfather Goosey were on an adventure when they encountered a green-apple tree. Even though the apples weren't ripe, they resisted the temptation.

Once upon a time, Uncle Wiggily, the rabbit, found himself in a tricky situation. A group of industrious ants came to his rescue. Each ant carried a grain of sand and together they buried Uncle Wiggily, leaving only his nose visible so he could breathe. When a giant approached, the rabbit was hidden from view by the sand, and the giant, who didn't like ants, passed by without noticing Uncle Wiggily. The giant grumbled in disappointment at missing his chance for a rabbit supper. Later, a good ant advised Uncle Wiggily to seek his fortune at a house with a fluttering flag. However, a bad giant switched the flags, leading Uncle Wiggily to the wrong house.
