Dame Hartley's warm voice comforted Hilda, telling her that her father had left and she shouldn't linger. Hilda followed the advice and climbed into the cart as instructed.

Hilda felt a long sigh of weariness and impatience escape her as Dame Hartley bade good morning to the rheumatism-stricken old Nancy and drove off down the wood-road. Sitting beside Hilda, Dame Hartley apologized for the delay, explaining that Reuel Slocum enjoyed their chat. Hilda, exhausted from her train ride, responded with cold civility, feeling heartsick and miserable. As they rode, Dame Hartley reminisced about Hilda's childhood visits to Hartley's Glen with her parents. The wood-road was filled with the cool, pleasant scent of ferns, surrounded by lush greenery. The journey continued until they reached an old yellow farm-house with inviting open gates, where Hilda's dread of spending three months overwhelmed her. The wagon halted, and a tall man welcomed them warmly, but Hilda's fixed determination to dislike her new home remained resolute.|"[""1.

Hilda, a once disagreeable girl, found herself in a heartwarming country garden after a delightful breakfast with the farmer. The farmer had kindly picked raspberries for her, and she now enjoyed fresh eggs and milk. The garden was a paradise of flowers with clove-pinks, lilies, roses, and more. The robin invited her to explore, promising cherries. Hilda, eager to work, offered to pick currants for jelly-making. She donned a hat with a daisy wreath and danced into the garden with a basket. The garden was a colorful spectacle, with flowers in full bloom, creating a peaceful and joyful atmosphere. Hilda's transformation from a scowling girl to one filled with gratitude and joy was evident as she immersed herself in the beauty of the garden.|"['1.

Hilda sat by the window stringing currants, lost in thoughts about Bubble Chirk and his education. Her mind wandered to his sister, Pink. The boy reminded her of a character from a favorite ballad.

Hilda felt embarrassed to voice her initial thoughts that the table and chair were set to lure her into sitting in a kitchen.

"""Isn't it a beautiful sight?"" the farmer exclaimed. He then spoke more seriously, expressing how he saw the glory of the Lord most clearly in a hayfield on a day like that. He believed that one should be able to feel close to God on a farm during the summer. After putting on his hat, Farmer Hartley got back to work. He instructed Huldy to stay and run home whenever she pleased. However, Huldy felt uneasy about mingling with the unfamiliar haymakers, especially Caliban, whom she disliked. Despite her feelings towards Caliban, she had grown fond of the farmer, his wife, and the little maidservant. Huldy found solace in the summer morning, sitting on a fragrant hay throne under the shade of a great oak tree. The hay rustled as she settled in, creating a cozy shelter from the sun.

Hilda chuckled at the squirrel's surprise and then shifted her focus to a large green grasshopper perched on her knee, displaying its features with seriousness. The grasshopper gracefully opened and closed its wings, showcasing their intricate design and colors. It then extended its legs one by one, emphasizing their length and strength. After a confident hop, the grasshopper cleaned itself meticulously with its antennae, fixing its gaze on Hilda as if challenging her. Just as Hilda pondered how to respond, a sudden appearance of a hairy, many-legged spider on her gown startled her. With a shriek, she brushed off the spider in terror. Feeling shaken, she glanced around, realizing the hay-makers were too far to notice. The peaceful moment shattered, Hilda debated her next move. Despite feeling drowsy and reluctant to help Nurse Lucy make butter, she spotted a cottage beyond the meadow and decided to explore. Curious about the inhabitants, especially a girl named Pink, Hilda embarked on a journey to satisfy her curiosity.|"[""1.

On a beautiful afternoon, three very happy individuals found themselves in a lovely spot near Mrs. Chirk's cottage, which they believed to be the second prettiest place in the world. The location they had selected was undeniably charming. Close to the cottage, there was a small pine grove with trees spaced just right for a wheelchair to pass through. In the grove, a large black rock stood, adorned with ferns growing in its crevices and a small birch tree swaying at its peak. At the base of the rock, a delicate stream of crystal-clear water trickled out, cold as ice and unbelievably transparent. Bubble had crafted a wooden trough to guide this fairy-like stream, which bubbled and cascaded with great enthusiasm. Nestled under the rock beside the stream was a lush bank of moss and ferns, a delightful place to rest. Queen Hildegarde sat on this bank, with Bubble at her feet, and sweet Pink beside her in her chair, resembling a white rose with her pristine white dress and pretty hat. Hilda was occupied with a mysterious basket, from which she produced a large napkin to spread on the moss.

Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess who spent all day looking at herself in a golden mirror. She was so vain that her beauty brought no joy to others. One day, a feeble white rose outside her window saw her and wished for her beauty. The rose crept inside, stole the princess's beauty, and transformed into a magnificent plant that brought happiness to all who saw it. The princess, now pale and colorless, had lost her beauty, but the rose's newfound radiance brightened the world. People admired and benefited from the rose's beauty and fragrance, making the world a better place.|"['1.

When the princess woke up, she saw a reflection of an old woman in her mirror. Shocked by her appearance, she fled the palace, claiming she was still beautiful. Sadly, no one believed her because she had become selfish and vain. Unlike the princess, a girl named Pink was content with her life despite being confined to a wheelchair. She found joy in simple things like love, friendship, and flowers. Pink's positive outlook on life inspired her friend Hildegarde, who felt guilty for taking her health for granted. Hildegarde admired Pink's resilience and realized the importance of appreciating what one has. As the days passed at Hartley Farm, Hildegarde eagerly awaited her parents' return, finding solace in the simple joys of everyday life.|"['1.

"""Dragons, can you hear me?"" she exclaimed, facing the wash-handstand. ""You've witnessed my mother, Dragons, washing her little blessed face in your bowl. That should have calmed your wildness, if anything could. Or have you been gleefully waving your paws ever since? Maybe I misjudged you, Dragons."" The blue dragons, as usual, stayed silent; while the gilt cherubs around the looking-glass tried to make up for it by smiling as much as they could. ""Such kind, understanding cherubs!"" the cheerful girl said, leaning in to kiss one of them while brushing her hair. ""You don't rage and frown when told that one's mother is coming home. I know you're happy, you dear old things!"" But then, a sudden thought struck her, causing a pang in her heart. The cherubs would still smile the same way even when she was gone! It wasn't all joy with this news. There was sorrow mixed with the excitement. Her heart was with her parents, of course. Just the thought of seeing her mother's face, of hearing her father's voice, made her blood dance with joy. Yet, she had to leave the farm; she had to leave Nurse Lucy and the farmer, and they would miss her. They loved her; how could they not, when she loved them so dearly?

The girl dashed through the kitchen and out onto the back porch, grabbing a lantern and matches. Her dog, Will, followed as they raced past the barn and cow-shed towards the old mill. The path was dark and eerie under the beech trees, making her nerves tingle. She lit the lantern, casting a feeble light as she descended the steps towards the glen. The once familiar surroundings now looked sinister in the dim glow. The water shimmered like a mysterious spirit, and the trees loomed like silent sentinels. A sudden fear gripped her, but a yelp from Will spurred her forward. As she entered the mill, a chilling wind and musty smell enveloped her.

Farmer Hartley, filled with agitation, focused on opening the box. It resisted at first, but eventually relented. Inside, a yellow silk handkerchief was neatly folded.
