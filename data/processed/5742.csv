On the Fourth of July, two streams were named to honor the day: Fourth of July Creek and Independence Creek. Fourth of July Creek can still be found on the map of Kansas. On this day, the men rested and celebrated. The first soldier to wake fired a gun, waking the others who cheered for the holiday. At night, another gun was fired, followed by a joyful dance around a campfire. Eventually, the ice and snow halted their journey, leading them to make a winter camp near the Mandan Indians. It was here that they encountered Sacajawea and her French husband, who agreed to join Lewis and Clark on their expedition to the West. Sacajawea, a member of the Snake Indian tribe, had a tumultuous past, having been captured by the Mandans as a young girl before marrying the Frenchman. She eagerly anticipated reuniting with her tribe on their journey.|['1.

During the harsh winter at Fort Mandan, the soldiers faced extreme cold and illness. Despite their health struggles, they worked tirelessly to prepare for their journey west in the spring. The captains diligently recorded their encounters with Native American tribes, animals, and plants in their journals and created detailed maps of the lands they traversed. Through acts of kindness like providing medicine and aiding an injured Indian boy, the soldiers forged friendships with the Native Americans. The Indians, impressed by the white men's medicine, traded food and supplies for items like stove pieces. On Christmas and New Year's Day, the soldiers celebrated with a flag-raising, a festive dinner, and lively dances that delighted the Native Americans.|"['1.

"Captain Clark had his black man, York, by his side. The Native Americans found York very intriguing. They believed he was stranger than the white men they had seen before. One Mandan chief even thought York was a white man painted black and tried to wash off the color. When York removed his hat, the chief was surprised by his unique hair. He then realized, ""You are not like a white man. You are a black man."" The Indians were fascinated by York and traveled from afar to see him. York played a vital role in bridging the gap between the Native Americans and the white explorers. In honor of York, the captains named a river after him, which they called York's Dry River. Meanwhile, at Fort Mandan, Sacajawea's baby boy was born. The soldiers adored the baby, giving him sugar and wooden toys, dancing to make him laugh. When the baby fell ill during their journey west, Captain Lewis provided medicine, and the men celebrated the baby's recovery by singing and dancing, bringing laughter back to the child's face."|"['1.

In April, as the sun warmed the icy Missouri River, a group set off in boats upstream. Sacajawea and her baby were crucial in showing they came in peace. The presence of a woman and child signaled to the Indians that it was not a war party, as only men go to battle. The Indians approached cautiously, expecting conflict. Sacajawea's actions taught the captains how to build friendships with the Indians. They learned that to show friendship, one must remove their moccasins and sit on a skin laid out by the chief. Smoking pipes together and exchanging gifts sealed their bond. This respectful gesture ensured they were true friends, avoiding the discomfort of walking barefoot on prickly terrain. Communication and mutual respect were key in establishing peaceful relations.|"[""1.

"""We have a message from the Great Father in Washington. He sends you gifts and wishes for friendship among all people. When everyone is united, men can hunt many animals, and women can gather abundant roots. The Great Father will provide goods to all once harmony is achieved. During the journey up the Missouri River, essential tools like the compass, books, and maps were in one canoe. A strong wind nearly capsized the canoe, but Sacajawea saved the precious items. The soldiers had to pause for two days to dry the wet maps and books. Later, they discovered a new river, which they named the Sacajawea River in honor of her bravery.

Traveling along the Missouri River, the group faced challenges. They had to drink the river water, which made them sick. Sand blew in their eyes, and mosquitoes constantly bit them. Despite these hardships, the soldiers remained content. They transported their supplies by boat and enjoyed hunting buffalo and elk near the river. One day in May, Captain Lewis spotted the towering Rocky Mountains in the distance. He felt immense joy at being the first white man to see them, even though he knew crossing them would be tough. When Sacajawea fell ill, the soldiers had to pause their journey. Captain Clark tried medicine, but it didn't work.

On the prairies of the Missouri, vast herds of buffaloes roamed. Sacajawea shared with the explorers how the Native Americans hunted them. One brave warrior disguised himself with a buffalo skin, standing between the grazing buffaloes and a steep river bank. As the warrior lured the herd towards the river, he dashed away, causing the buffaloes to follow. The animals tumbled over the bank, meeting their fate. The Native Americans skinned the buffaloes, preserving the meat and hides for various uses. Meanwhile, Captain Lewis, leading the expedition, encountered the majestic Great Falls of the Missouri. The breathtaking sight left him in awe, unable to capture its magnificence in words or drawings. The explorers had to circumvent the falls, creating caches to lighten their load before continuing their journey.|['1.

In the wilderness, soldiers created secret caches by digging a hole and lining it with branches and skins to hide their goods. This clever trick kept their belongings safe from prying eyes. Exploring near the Missouri Falls, the group encountered rattlesnakes basking in the sun. Captain Lewis once saved himself from a rattlesnake attack by swiftly shooting a snake with seventeen rattles. Sometimes soldiers had to walk barefoot, risking snake bites. Sacajawea, a skilled guide, knew how to treat snake bites using a special root called the rattlesnake root. By applying the root to the wound, she healed the soldiers' bites, showcasing her invaluable knowledge of nature's remedies.|"['1.

"After moving all the goods to the top of the Falls, the men crafted canoes to transport them up the river. On the Fourth of July in 1805, they camped at the Falls. Captain Lewis described a delightful dinner with ""bacon, beans, buffalo meat, and suet dumplings,"" almost as good as being at home. Following the meal, a soldier played the fiddle, and those who could dance did so on the green. During an expedition with Sacajawea and her husband, Captain Clark foresaw rain and sought shelter in a ravine. As the rain intensified, a wave formed in the ravine, prompting Captain Clark to act swiftly, saving them from being swept away. The wave washed away the baby's basket, clothes, and Captain Clark's compass, which was later recovered by a soldier."|"['1.

"When the canoes were prepared, the group set out up the river beyond the Falls. As they entered the mountains, the river became narrower. Although not deep, it flowed swiftly. The soldiers had to tug the canoes using ropes. The river didn't follow a straight path. One day, the men hauled the canoes for twelve miles, only to find themselves four miles from their starting point. They had to wade in the river all day, resulting in cuts on their feet from the rocks. They suffered from constant dampness, enduring hot days and cold nights. Without proper wood, they struggled to build a fire. Despite these challenges, they had sufficient food. Eventually, the river became too narrow for the canoes to pass through. The soldiers submerged the canoes with rocks to create a cache, storing skins, plants, seeds, minerals, maps, and medicines. Captain Lewis and a few men advanced ahead to search for Indians to trade for horses. As the river narrowed further, a soldier straddled it, exclaiming, ""Thank God, I am alive to bestride the mighty Missouri."" This marked the discovery of the Missouri's origin, close to the start of the Columbia River. In August, the soldiers reached this juncture. Captain Lewis felt immense joy as he drank from the origins of both rivers. Captain Clark and the remaining men, accompanied by Sacajawea, followed with the goods at a slower pace."|"['1.

"The group joined Sacajawea's tribe at their camp. Captain Clark was escorted to the chief's willow house. The chief warmly welcomed him, seating him on a white skin and adorning his hair with six shells. Everyone removed their moccasins and shared a silent smoke. When conversation was needed, Sacajawea was summoned. She recognized the chief as her brother, embracing him joyfully. Sacajawea explained the white men's desire to cross the Rocky Mountains to reach the Western waters. She proposed that the tribe could assist by providing horses and guiding them through the rugged terrain. The chief, grateful for the white men's kindness towards Sacajawea, pledged his support.

"Cameahwait spoke highly of the white men to his people, emphasizing their good qualities and the benefits of helping them. He explained that by selling them horses and guiding them over the mountains, the white men could return home quickly, bringing goods to trade. If the Native Americans didn't assist them, the white men would struggle to cross the mountains and might perish, resulting in lost opportunities for trade. The people agreed to help, showing their approval by saying, ""Ah hi e!"" They provided horses to carry goods and makeshift saddles for the men. As they journeyed through the mountains, Sacajawea overheard some Native Americans planning to abandon the white men to hunt buffalo on the plains, prioritizing their own needs over trade."|"['1.

The group discovered a new root on the lower Columbia River. The Native Americans named it wappato, while Captain Clark called it arrowhead. The wappato grew year-round, and the Indian women harvested it. They used a light canoe to gather the wappato from a pond. The women would wade into the water, place the canoe, and with their toes, pull the wappato from the pond's bottom. After collecting it, they filled the canoe and carried it home on their heads. The wappato was roasted on hot stones and tasted delicious. The soldiers found it to be the best root they had ever eaten. The Indian women would sell some wappato to other tribes upstream. On their challenging journey down the Columbia River in canoes, the group faced constant rain, rapids, and wet conditions.

At Fort Clatsop, the explorers diligently recorded their adventures in journals. They detailed their journey to the Pacific, mapping the lands near the Missouri River, the Rocky Mountains, and the Columbia River. Meanwhile, some of the men hunted for food and crafted over three hundred pairs of moccasins from animal skins for the journey back. To prepare for the return trip, five soldiers were tasked with making salt by boiling ocean water day and night for seven weeks. This salt was a prized treat for the group. On Christmas Day, the soldiers surprised the captains with a festive wake-up call, singing carols and exchanging gifts. Despite the rainy weather, they celebrated with dance and song. As the New Year approached, they eagerly anticipated their return home in 1807.|['1.

In March, the elk departed the woods near Fort Clatsop, leaving the soldiers struggling to find enough food. The captains decided it was time to head back home. They traded a soldier-coat and some items for a canoe, and acquired another canoe from the Clatsops in exchange for elk meat stolen by the Indians. With limited supplies for food and horses, they relied on their well-maintained guns with good powder and balls to hunt along the way. They traded their big flag for robes to barter for food. The captains entrusted letters to the Clatsops detailing their journey out West and plans to return East. As they bid farewell and journeyed up the Columbia River, they sang joyfully, eager to return home. Along the river, they hunted and shared game with the Indians, reaching Camp Chopunnish at the foot of the mountains in May. Hindered by snow, they prepared for the crossing, assisting ill Indians and negotiating for horses and guides. Despite a mishap losing goods in a canoe accident, they pressed on, determined to reach their destination.|['1. What did the captains trade for a canoe before heading back home?\nA. Soldier-coat\nB.
