The early Saxons were fierce tribes of the Teutonic barbarians who conquered England from the old Celtic inhabitants around 400 years after the Romans had left. The Saxons, along with the Engle and Jute tribes, originated from Central Asia and were settled in villages in what is now Schleswig and parts of Germany. The social structure revolved around the _oetheling_ or _corl_, who led warlike expeditions and protected his kinsmen. Agriculture was the foundation of their lives, supplemented by hunting, fishing, and seafaring. The Saxon warriors, skilled in both land and sea endeavors, were also religious, worshipping the powers of Nature with devotion. They arrived in Britain in 449, answering the call for aid against invaders, and were led by Hengist and Horsa to the Isle of Thanet.|['1.

Hengist and Horsa, the earliest Saxon heroes in England, came as mercenaries but soon sought richer lands. They attracted fellow pirates from the Elbe and Rhine. Cerdic later conquered the southern coast, founding Wessex. The Britons, led by Arthur, fiercely resisted but succumbed after years of battle. England became Saxon after the Britons' defeat, erasing Roman influence. Seven kings ruled post-conquest, later reduced to three. Paganism prevailed until Christianity spread in the 7th century. Gregory the Great's encounter with fair Saxon slaves in Rome led to their conversion. Augustin and monks were sent to Kent, establishing the first English bishopric.

After the Saxon conquest of Britain, traces of Christianity seemed to vanish, eradicating Roman influence. However, once Christianity took root among the Saxons, its progress was swift.

Despite occasional criticism of her rule as arbitrary, Elizabeth adhered to the laws and respected the Constitution, ensuring that her actions were in line with the wishes of the populace.|"[""1.

It is indeed a lot to ask of rulers to give up their power willingly, and even more so to grant more political power to the people. Throughout history, most renowned rulers have been reluctant to relinquish their authority. Did the great rulers like the Antonines, Theodosius, Charlemagne, or Frederick II willingly give up their powers? Even when the Emperor of Russia emancipated serfs, he did not grant them political power to prevent any threats to his throne. In contrast, the American people granted political equality to former slaves, following the doctrine of abstract rights advocated by Rousseau, embraced by Jefferson and Franklin. Monarchs often have reservations about extending political rights to those they consider inexperienced. Rather than expanding popular liberties, they prefer to emphasize established responsibilities. Queen Elizabeth I, for example, supported the principles of the Reformation and defended her people against Catholic priests and feudal nobles without imposing more restrictions. Despite having significant prerogatives and wealth, Elizabeth was constrained by the laws of the realm and the power of Parliament, which represented the wealthy classes more than the common people. Elizabeth's rule was not a despotism since she lacked a large standing army and could not levy taxes without Parliament's consent. She understood the limitations of her power, avoiding the tyranny and oppression seen in other rulers like Louis XIV or Napoleon. Elizabeth's decision to execute Mary Queen of Scots, however, is often criticized, as it was deemed unnecessary and unjust. Mary had a legitimate claim to the throne|"['1.

The killing of Mary Stuart because of her Catholic faith or due to fear or jealousy is unjustifiable. England had the right to set aside her succession because she was Catholic and posed a threat to the Reformation. However, Mary had the right to her religion and her captivity and subsequent execution were cruel and criminal acts. Elizabeth's decision to execute Mary was driven by the fear of a Catholic successor and potential plots against the throne. Mary's constant intrigues and alliances with hostile powers posed a threat to the English nation. While Mary was perceived as a bitter enemy and a threat to Elizabeth's life, the execution was seen as a necessary measure to safeguard Protestantism and the English throne. Mary's death, although she was accused of crimes against the state, was more a result of royal and national jealousy. Elizabeth's decision to execute Mary was influenced by the perceived threats posed by Mary's actions. Essex, another victim of Elizabeth's reign, was executed for his involvement in a rebellion against the throne. Despite his past services and qualities, his act of treason warranted his punishment. Elizabeth's decision to execute Essex was in line with the laws and precedents of England. While we may empathize with Essex's fate, his actions demanded the consequences he faced.|"['1.

Elizabeth faced criticism for her behavior as a woman rather than as a ruler. Accusations labeled her as cunning, thrifty, envious, arrogant, and masculine. However, these flaws might have been a result of her circumstances, such as being surrounded by spies and foes, which forced her to conceal her thoughts and feelings. Despite her imperfections, Elizabeth possessed virtues, abilities, and made significant contributions as a queen. Historians should focus on her positive attributes rather than magnifying her faults. Malicious claims about her personal life were likely spread by enemies seeking to tarnish her reputation. Elizabeth's private life, with its alleged flirtations, remains disputed, with no concrete evidence of wrongdoing. Her weaknesses, like vanity and irascibility, are overshadowed by her patriotism, honesty, and compassion. Elizabeth's strength and intelligence were assets in governing a turbulent society, making her a remarkable queen despite her flaws.|"['1.

Queen Elizabeth I of England is celebrated for her remarkable character and public service. Her legacy stands out even when compared to other female monarchs like Isabella, Mary, and Catherine de Médicis. Elizabeth's moral influence surpasses even sovereigns like Catherine II of Russia and Maria Theresa of Germany. Her reign over a small island did not limit her impact, as her wisdom and ability left an enduring mark on history. Elizabeth's influence, like that of Victoria, transcended her power, reflecting the enduring importance of character over sheer authority. Politicians may wield temporary power, but statesmen like Burke and Canning endure through their ideas.

During the infamous St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572, the King hesitated to give the order for the slaughter, but his mother, Catherine, pushed him to carry out the brutal act. The massacre began at midnight in Paris, where men, women, and children were mercilessly killed by soldiers. The violence spread for days, with no one spared, not even in churches. The atrocities continued in other cities across France, with the Pope even celebrating the massacre. This event sparked outrage among Protestants, especially in England, uniting the Huguenots in defiance. Despite the loss of leaders like Coligny and Condé, a young man named Henry emerged as a new hope for the Huguenots, leading them to defend La Rochelle successfully against the royal army.

Soon after successfully defending La Rochelle, Charles IX passed away at twenty-four, tormented by remorse and insanity. His mother, cold and unyielding, showed no compassion. Two years later, the King of Navarre fled, impressing many with his courage and military prowess, supported by his advisor Rosny. Despite facing opposition from Catholics and the King, Henry navigated the political landscape, eventually becoming King of France. The battle of Ivry was a turning point, solidifying Henry's rule. Leading his troops with valor, he inspired them with his unwavering determination.

The Battle of Ivry was a great victory for King Henry, the soldier of Navarre. He showed his chivalry and bravery on the battlefield. Even in the face of triumph, he faced challenges from the Catholics. Henry's determination and strategic skills were put to the test during the siege of Paris. Despite his success, he chose peace over prolonged conflict. His decision to abjure his religion and cause for the sake of unity and stability in France showed his pragmatism as a ruler. Henry's reign, whether as a Protestant or Catholic king, was marked by his desire for a united and prosperous France.

Henry IV, granted tolerance to the Huguenots, but his successors reversed his decision. If he had known the consequences, he might have fought to remain a Protestant king. The aftermath was the destruction of La Rochelle, the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and the brutal persecution of the Huguenots. The Thirty Years' War, led by Gustavus Adolphus, was a struggle for religious freedom in Germany. Unlike the Huguenot wars, it was between Catholic and Protestant German states. It was both a religious and political conflict, affecting the balance of power in Europe. Charles V's abdication led to the rise of Ferdinand and Philip, who aimed to suppress Protestantism. The war was a result of Luther's ideas and involved various European powers. Germany was divided by religious strife, leading to a fiery persecution of Protestants. Religious fervor and political ambitions intertwined in this tumultuous period in European history.|"[""1.

During the 16th century, tensions between Catholics and Lutherans in Germany led to the Treaty of Augsburg in 1555, granting Lutherans toleration. This peace lasted until Matthias' reign in 1612, where Protestants faced persecution. Matthias' successor, Ferdinand II, was a staunch enemy of Protestants and imposed severe restrictions. In Bohemia, a revolt erupted against Ferdinand's tyranny, resulting in the Bohemians choosing Frederick V as their king. However, Ferdinand's forces, led by Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria, defeated the uprising at the Battle of Prague in 1620. Subsequently, Bohemia faced brutal persecution with executions, suppression of liberties, and outlawing of Protestants. This period marked a dark chapter in Bohemian history, where Austrian despotism and papal superstition prevailed. Despite persecution, history shows that enduring virtues often arise from sacrifice and martyrdom, shaping the course of societies.|"[""1.

In the 17th century, the suppression of religious freedom in Bohemia led to widespread suffering and sparked outrage across Europe. The Protestant princes of Germany, along with England and the Dutch, united against the Emperor due to the injustices faced by those who tried to help Bohemia. The Protestant forces, led by King Christian of Denmark, aimed to reclaim lost territories. Meanwhile, the Transylvanian prince Bethlen Gabor invaded Hungary and Austria. To counter this threat, the Emperor enlisted the help of Wallenstein, a military genius akin to England's Thomas Wentworth. Wallenstein quickly raised a massive army of outlaws and adventurers, intimidating both friends and foes with his power. Despite initial victories, the Protestant forces faced defeat, leaving Germany devastated. The Emperor, emboldened by his triumph, sought to expand his power and suppress Protestantism across Europe, leading to widespread suffering and chaos.|"[""1.

When a man accustomed to warfare and battles excels in the humble modesty of a Christian gentleman or contemplative sage, we hold him in high esteem. We perceive his soul as pure and superior to common temptations. The true greatness of the soul and heart is only revealed in war by a noble cause. This cause elevates a man beyond himself, connecting his soul to God. The sacredness of a great cause illuminated the character of Washington. Battles without a noble purpose lack grandeur. The conflicts at Bunker Hill and Princeton gained significance through American independence and the expansion of greatness. The majesty of a cause not only creates great generals but also good men. Gustavus Adolphus, with his moral beauty, armed himself to deliver oppressed peoples, making him a true hero. His cause inspired Protestant Europe to defend against political degradation and preserve dear liberties. Gustavus embarked on war against Austria to safeguard his Lutheran brethren and protect against Austria's overwhelming power. His motive was not solely personal, but driven by duty to maintain the balance of power in Europe. Gustavus, convinced of his duty, explained his intentions to his kingdom's deputies before departing for battle. His mission was to prevent the subjugation of the Continent and secure civil and religious freedom for future generations.|"['1.

During the reign of Gustavus Adolphus, a ruler faced with the choice of going to war without a direct invasion, his decision was likely justified. If he had not intervened, the Austrian emperor would have likely conquered Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. The Protestant religion faced suppression, and a united Catholic German Empire would have posed a significant threat. While some might criticize Gustavus for invading Germany, his heroic actions to aid suffering humanity are commendable. Signs and prodigies were believed to forewarn the impending bloody conflict. Gustavus' campaigns, battles, and victories ultimately led to the defeat of Austria and the liberation of northern Germany. Military history, though often monotonous, reveals the impact of wars on civilization. Gustavus' legacy was shaped by his early actions and the dismissal of the ruthless Wallenstein, allowing him to secure pivotal victories.|"['1.

Ferdinand was reluctant to let go of Wallenstein, the general who helped him secure his throne. Despite his personal attachment, Ferdinand had to yield to pressure and dismiss Wallenstein. Wallenstein, commanding a massive army, accepted the decree without resistance, knowing the consequences of defying his sovereign. He retired to his estates, living a lavish life and focusing on his studies. However, the Emperor's decision proved to be a mistake as Tilly, a ruthless but less capable general, faced Gustavus without success.

The death of Gustavus Adolphus in the hour of victory was a shock that deeply impacted his allies, akin to losing a dear friend. His demise, though in triumph, felt like too high a price to pay for the victory. Gustavus, the greatest protector of Protestantism, had foreseen his fate. The battle at Lutzen saw the Protestants emerge victorious, but at the cost of Gustavus' life. He fell, proclaiming his identity as the King of Sweden and sealing the German nation's liberties and religion with his blood. His death left a void, as Pappenheim, the courageous Austrian general, also perished along with the elite of Wallenstein's army. Gustavus' untimely end prevented the temptation of wielding excessive power and setting laws for the liberated lands.

The Thirty Years' War lost its intensity after the battle of Lutzen. The final resolution came 16 years later with the signing of the peace of Westphalia in 1648. This treaty secured Germany's freedoms and established a power balance. It set the stage for future European treaties and marked a new era in history. Wallenstein, once a renowned military leader, saw his reputation decline after Lutzen. Despite his inactivity, his power and pride remained until his assassination for suspected treachery. The war's aftermath was devastating, with Germany losing millions of people and entire villages. Law and order vanished, leaving a trail of desolation and misery.

During the regency of Marie de Médicis following the assassination of Henry IV, France was plagued by turmoil. The nobles, powerful and arrogant, engaged in constant intrigue and treachery, seeking to divide the kingdom among themselves. They disregarded the law, oppressed the people, and even conspired with foreign enemies. The Queen-regent, humiliated and weak, resorted to manipulation and played the nobles against each other to maintain some semblance of control. The Huguenots, once a strong faction, were now embittered and discontented, causing further unrest. Feudalism, once necessary, now contributed to the chaos.

Richelieu, born in 1585 to a noble family, was destined for the army but became a priest due to a bishopric gift. Ambitious and power-hungry, he used lies, flattery, and deceit to climb the political ladder. Despite his amiable facade, he was a master manipulator, charming all he met. By aligning with key figures like De Luynes and Queen Marie de Medicis, he secured a cardinal's hat. Richelieu became indispensable to King Louis XIII, a weak monarch, and rose to power as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1624.

During a tumultuous period in France's history, the King found himself in a precarious position. Isolated and lacking trustworthy advisors, he faced challenges from all sides. His own family defied his authority, nobles conspired against him, and the country was threatened by internal and external enemies. Recognizing the need for a strong leader, the King turned to Richelieu, a cunning and controversial figure. Richelieu, a member of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, believed in absolute monarchy, where power resided solely in the hands of the king. While he upheld the authority of the crown, he also maintained the privileges of the aristocracy. Richelieu's rise to power marked a shift towards centralized rule, where the king's authority was paramount.

Richelieu, a statesman unlike Louis XIV, took a broad view of the country's well-being. He altered La Rochelle's fortifications and government, retaining some religious freedoms while curtailing civil rights for Huguenots. The English government's treatment of Dissenters in the 18th century mirrors this. Richelieu then turned on the unruly nobles, beheading, exiling, and imprisoning those who defied the law. The Queen-mother, once a powerful foe, was forced into exile by Richelieu's cunning. The Duke of Orleans and other nobles faced similar fates, with some executed or exiled. Richelieu's iron grip extended even to the King himself, who was compelled to sever ties with loved ones. The minister's unyielding power over the monarch remains unparalleled in history.|"['1.

Cardinal Richelieu, a powerful figure in French history, dealt with various challenges during his time. Among these, he curbed the influence of the parliament of Paris, which had the authority to validate the King's decrees. This body, primarily composed of aristocratic lawyers, could be a hindrance to royal authority. Richelieu's actions aimed to consolidate power around the monarchy, ensuring its grandeur. Unlike the English parliament, which resisted Charles I, the French people at the time lacked political aspirations. Richelieu not only centralized authority but also expanded France's borders, securing the nation against external threats.

When individuals are virtuous, honorable, and courageous, leaders like Washington emerge. Conversely, selfish and lawless times call forth figures like Richelieu and Napoleon, signaling a nation's decline.

Throughout history, civil wars have rarely been necessary to secure rights that could not have been obtained through peaceful means. In England, many rights were gained through appeals to reason and justice rather than through violence. The English Civil War resulted in a bloodless revolution where Parliament, with its power over the purse-strings, was able to challenge the King without resorting to arms. However, when the King sought to use force to suppress liberty, war became a defensive measure. The conflict led to the rise of Oliver Cromwell, who ultimately abolished the monarchy and executed the King as a consequence of his actions. The events of that time were shaped by the prevailing ideas and beliefs, and even though Cromwell played a significant role in the King's execution, it was ultimately a product of the era's political and religious climate.|"['1.

Louis XIV, a notable sovereign, inherited power and wealth from his predecessors, Richelieu and Mazarin, who concentrated authority in the king's hands. Louis XIII, despite being a weak Bourbon, elevated his throne in Europe. Richelieu, a benefactor to law and order, faced opposition from nobles after his death, leading to the Fronde.

During the reign of Louis XIV, the extravagant construction of palaces like Versailles led to immense costs and the neglect of other nations' rights. Louis, like Napoleon, exuded arrogance and treated his subjects with haughty insolence. He made conquests during peacetime, persecuted Protestants, and seized territories from independent rulers. The grand court at Versailles, filled with nobles and scholars, was a scene of revelry and intrigue. Louis' pursuit of adulterous pleasures tarnished the reputation of the Bourbon dynasty. Despite his mistresses' influence, they were eventually replaced, as Louis sought solace in superstition and faced great reversals.

When Colbert passed away in 1685, a change occurred in the King's decisions. Despite the King's improved moral character, errors were made. This shift coincided with his association with Madame de Maintenon and the Jesuits. They refined the court's conduct, leading to the removal of Montespan. Bossuet and La Chaise gained significant influence over the King's conscience. Louis recognized his duties, prioritizing the people's welfare over personal glory. However, a grave misstep occurred when he revoked the Edict of Nantes, eliminating religious tolerance.

During the reign of Louis XIV, many prominent individuals left France due to religious persecution, weakening the support for the king. Notable figures like Marshal Schomberg and Admiral Duquesne, along with historians and scientists, sought refuge in foreign lands. This exodus of talent and intellect left France vulnerable. The king faced growing opposition from William of Orange and a coalition of states, leading to a war that saw France losing territories gained in previous conflicts. The period following this war was marked by internal strife, including clashes between religious factions and the banishment of influential figures like Fénelon. The intellectual and material decline of France under Louis XIV's rule foreshadowed a period of economic hardship and social unrest.|"['1.

Despite facing numerous calamities, the blinded King was determined to wage another war to place his grandson on the throne of Spain. This disastrous conflict could have been avoided if he had been willing to set aside his ambition and pride. Despite being humbled and weakened, he could not relinquish the opportunity that arose from the death of Carlos II of Spain. However, Europe was resolute in preventing further expansion of the Bourbons. Consequently, war erupted in 1701, lasting twelve years and causing immense suffering in France. Louis XIV resorted to drastic measures, even melting down his past victories to feed his starving troops. Despite offering concessions and seeking peace, he faced relentless opposition from the allies, leading to significant losses and humiliation for France. Ultimately, the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 left Louis XIV with most of his original territories, albeit with substantial setbacks and a tarnished legacy.|"[""1.

The reign of Louis XV is viewed as a continuation of the self-centered rule of his predecessor, Louis XIV, leading to the vices and discontent that set the stage for the French Revolution. Louis XV's reign further exacerbated the issues created by Louis XIV's costly wars and lavish lifestyle. The reckless spending and indulgence in pleasure during Louis XV's reign worsened the burden on the people and weakened the nation. The misrule of the previous seventy years, combined with Louis XV's follies, heightened the calamities faced by the French. The era saw a decline in French military successes, loss of territories in America and India, and financial crises like the collapse of Law's schemes. The reign of Cardinal Fleury marked a brief period of stability before mistresses and corrupt favorites took over, setting the stage for the eventual revolution.|"[""1.

During the reign of Louis XV, the nation faced severe financial troubles due to the massive debt inherited from Louis XIV. This debt stemmed from extravagant spending on wars and palaces, totaling nearly two thousand million livres. The Duke of Orleans, who succeeded Louis XIV, further increased the debt through reckless spending. To address the financial crisis, the idea of national bankruptcy was proposed, but it was rejected in favor of a plan by John Law, a Scottish financier. Law's scheme involved establishing a bank that issued paper currency backed by shares in the Mississippi Company. The plan led to a financial bubble where the value of the company's shares soared, and bank bills were widely circulated. However, the bubble eventually burst, leading to widespread ruin and exposing the deception and fraud perpetrated by the government.|"[""1.

Under Cardinal Fleury's administration from 1726 to 1743, the country's finances saw some improvement due to his focus on cost-effective measures, particularly in tax collection. However, his attempts to follow in the footsteps of Sully and Colbert fell short due to a lack of their brilliance and daring, resulting in minimal impact. Cardinal Fleury faced challenges, including a dispute with the Parliament of Paris that led to the repeal of a favored policy. Following his passing, the King's mistress, Madame de Pompadour, wielded significant influence, leading to excessive spending and a growing public deficit. The court's reluctance to address financial issues led to increased debt, reaching nearly two hundred million in a single year. The heavy tax burden imposed on the populace, without their consent, led to widespread discontent and harsh repercussions for any resistance. The people endured oppressive taxation, with a significant portion of their earnings going to the state and landlords, leaving little for their sustenance. The unfair and excessive taxation, combined with oppressive laws and lack of freedoms, created a system that exploited and oppressed the laboring class. The nobles and courtiers benefited from monopolies, further draining the state's resources. The laborers faced injustices and restrictions, with feudalism's oppressive weight limiting their prospects for improvement or redress. The elite lived lavishly while the common people suffered under the weight of taxes and injustices, perpetuating a cycle of inequality and hardship.|"[""1.

During the era of Louis XV, the nobles of France lived in extravagance and excess, displaying their wealth and status through luxurious attire and opulent lifestyles. These nobles, unlike the powerful feudal lords of the past, were more focused on courtly affairs and indulging in pleasures. They enjoyed various privileges exempting them from taxes and granting them exclusive roles in the military, church, and court. Their elaborate clothing and accessories distinguished them from the common people. The nobles spent lavishly on fashion, with a single outfit costing a fortune. They frequented the opera in grand style, showcasing their wealth through embroidered garments, precious jewels, and expensive perfumes. Despite their enervated state, they maintained a mock-heroic appearance with swords and military-style hats. The nobles' excessive focus on appearance and frivolous pursuits reflected a society marked by decadence and moral decline.|"['1.

The King, despite his distaste for affairs of state and preference for indulging his mistresses, possessed considerable intellect and wit. He grasped the implications of the philosophers' writings that hinted at revolution, although he banished those who could have supported his rule. His moral weakness and self-indulgence prevented him from acting decisively against threats to his power. Louis XV's reign was marked by the influence of women, notably Madame de Pompadour, who wielded immense power over political appointments and finances, leading to scandal and disgrace. Despite her humble origins, she commanded respect and homage from all levels of society, even overshadowing royalty itself. This era of female dominance at court had far-reaching consequences on the nation's affairs, with the King's inability to assert his authority resulting in a melancholic and despised end to his reign.|"[""1.

During the reign of Madame de Pompadour, two significant events occurred that greatly impacted the kingdom. The first was the expulsion of the Jesuits, a group disliked by Madame de Pompadour due to their interference with her power, rather than their conservative beliefs. This expulsion, along with the rise of philosophers, led to a shift in influence within the kingdom. The second event was the triumph of the philosophers, marking a turning point in the intellectual landscape of the time. The expulsion of the Jesuits, despite its negative and positive repercussions, ultimately unleashed a wave of new ideas and philosophies, contributing to a period of moral confusion and societal upheaval in France during the reign of Louis XV.|"['1.

Madame de Pompadour, a powerful figure, opposed the Jesuits and supported those undermining society under the guise of liberty. The philosophers' writings fueled the revolutionary storm. Ideas, good or evil, have lasting power. The 18th century was more intellectual than believed, with thinkers like Voltaire challenging society. The court, unaware, admired philosophers who later influenced radicals like Robespierre. Voltaire, with his vast output, subtly attacked religion. Encyclopedists like Diderot questioned religious beliefs openly. Rousseau's egotism and ideas of liberty influenced revolutionaries. These philosophers, though subverting oppressive systems, also contributed to the downfall of the monarchy. Their impact on the French Revolution will be discussed further.|"['1.

During the regency years, when his half-sister held power, Peter didn't show his future abilities. Surrounded by pleasures in his youth, he was dissipated and neglected his education. After freeing himself from his sister's influence, he realized his purpose. His aim was to civilize and empower his country, focusing on its political strength and welfare. Peter met a young man named Lefort, who became his mentor, teaching him about military discipline and naval efficiency. They both agreed that to strengthen the country, they needed to address the Streltzi issue. Peter started from the bottom, joining a regiment as a drummer and worked his way up to learn the art of war.

His insatiable thirst for knowledge led him to master ship-building, the Dutch language, and various sciences.

After leaving England, the Czar traveled to Vienna through Holland, where he sent five hundred skilled individuals back to Russia to aid in the industrial growth of his country. This act was in stark contrast to Louis XIV, who expelled four hundred thousand Protestants from his kingdom. Despite his short stay in Vienna to study its military establishments, Peter had to swiftly return to Moscow to quell a rebellion. His travels made him a much wiser man, setting an example for modern tourists. Peter's focus on self-improvement during his travels highlights the importance of meaningful journeys. Upon his return, he decisively dealt with the Streltzi, a group fomenting treason, showing both wisdom and ruthlessness in his actions. His reforms extended to the military, changing their attire and enforcing discipline.

Peter's strategic retreats and reforms secured his victory and allowed him to expand Russian territories.

During his Swedish war around 1702, Peter the Great conquered Ladoga and the Neva from the Swedes. He saw a marshy area, a delta formed by the Neva's branches, as the future site for his empire's capital, St. Petersburg. Despite challenges like being inaccessible by water for half the year and lacking building materials, Peter chose it to connect with Western Europe. St. Petersburg emerged quickly, resembling Pandemonium's creation in Milton's poem. Moscow's senate later moved there. While the old capital, Moscow, sits lonely, Peter's eyes look towards Constantinople for its strategic location bridging Europe and Asia. Peter visited Europe, studying art and law.

This tragic event is considered a dark mark on Peter's rule, shocking the world. I won't absolve Peter of cruelty, nor condemn him. The ultimate judgment lies with Heaven.

In the history of Peter the Great, his immense labors and unwavering determination have earned him the title of the Father of his country. His energy and genius inspired many to acknowledge his greatness. On the contrary, Frederic the Great's story revolves around a man who committed a grave crime, leading to consequences that haunted him across Europe. Despite this, his heroism and remarkable abilities captivated those who admired strength and success. Frederic's challenging journey, marked by struggles and triumphs, teaches valuable moral lessons. Born in 1712, Frederic ascended the Prussian throne after a tumultuous upbringing under his strict father. His reign unfolded during an era of cynicism and moral decay, where materialistic philosophies prevailed.

Despite his controversial seizure of Silesia, Frederic's resilience and strategic brilliance during the war earned him admiration as a military hero.

During the war, Austria bore the brunt of the conflict, resembling a civil war due to being equally German. Austria, a Catholic nation, clashed with Protestant Prussia. If Austria had triumphed, Germany might have united under Catholic rule. The Austrians, led by Prince Carl and Marshal Daun, valiantly fought Prussia, who defended Silesia. The war began offensively but ended defensively. Frederick faced a formidable enemy in Russia until the new Czar befriended him. The French and Saxons offered limited aid. France, lacking enthusiasm, fought without a cause. England, allied with Frederick, provided financial support.

During the war, England emerged as a significant victor, establishing maritime dominance and boosting its manufacturing and trade sectors, crucial for future clashes with Napoleon. England also acquired colonial territories, a foothold in India, and control over Canada. The conflict spread across the globe, showcasing battles in various regions. This period saw the rise of military leaders like Washington in America and victories by Clive and Hastings in India. France suffered the most significant losses, surrendering territories and military reputation, leading to internal strife.

After Frederic escaped the dangers of the Seven Years' War, it's surprising he quickly got involved in another terrible act - the partition of Poland, where Russia and Austria were also complicit. I'm even more shocked that Carlyle tried to justify this crime with his arguments. In real life, seizing a neighbor's property because they are weak or mismanaged is unjust. Justifying Russia's attempt to take Turkey or England's conquest of India based on desire rather than right is equally wrong. The same laws that govern individuals should apply to kings and nations. Freeing nations from moral obligations would lead to chaos. Although Poland may not have been ready for self-rule, that doesn't excuse its political destruction. The world condemned this crime then, and its effects linger. Carlyle's claim that the partition of Poland was divinely ordained contradicts the fundamental principle of treating others as you would want to be treated. True civilization is based on righteousness, not cruelty or selfishness. Frederic may have managed his ill-gotten gains effectively, but his focus on military power, rather than national development, had consequences. His establishment of a military monarchy and fortresses overshadowed his personal qualities and achievements. Despite his frugality and discipline, his legacy was tarnished by his ambition for military might rather than the common good.|"[""1.
