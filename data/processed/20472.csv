Mrs. Harlowe hesitated. Grace often brought home strangers, both people and animals, and her mother was used to her daughter's unpredictable nature. Grace was known for her kindness to the less fortunate in the town slum. She would invite them into the kitchen for a meal and send them off with a small bouquet. Mrs. Harlowe expressed her concerns about having these guests in the parlor. Grace reassured her mother that Anne, a timid girl she had brought home, was kind and needed their help. Anne, dressed in old-fashioned clothes, was overwhelmed at her first party. Grace placed her at the table and asked her friends to be kind. Anne was captivated by Miriam's elegant attire but was hurt by her sneering remarks. Later, a kind old lady arrived, making Anne feel like she was in the presence of royalty.

"Grace and her friends were worried about Anne's performance, fearing she might break down and disappoint them, except for the unkind Miriam. However, Anne surprised everyone by confidently reciting ""The Raven"" with a clear, musical voice that captivated the girls.

Even Miss Tebbs, the English and elocution teacher, couldn't have done better. The next day, Grace, Jessica, and Nora were invited to Mrs. Gray's luncheon after church. Excited, the girls met in front of the Catholic Church and walked up the street, where Anne Pierson joined them, looking serious and enthusiastic. Anne expressed her eagerness to win a prize, feeling determined to outshine Miriam Nesbit.

"""Miriam, your group is slipping away,"" the older girl teased. ""You're not in control yet. Leave the nutting parties for the younger students."" Miriam thought of Anne Pierson, realizing they were neck and neck despite her hard work. This was her chance for payback. The sophomores, known for mischief, were led by this girl. They had a history of pranks since Grammar School. The meeting spot, the Omnibus House, an old inn, was now in ruins. The freshmen gathered there, enjoying the autumn weather. Nora, pretending to be strict, was interrupted by hooded figures. The girls, outnumbered, were warned to never return by the Black Monks of Asia.

The girls, led by Grace, were leaving the enclosure when a gust of wind exposed a monk's navy blue skirt. Grace charged at the monks, followed by the other girls, almost causing a fight. The Black Monks scattered, and Grace chased one into the orchard. She then decided to head home as the afternoon was spoiled. The sophomores had disrupted their outing, and Grace vowed to get even. As they tried to run, tramps blocked their path, but the girls retaliated by pelting them with apples. The boys joined in, and the tramps fled. The girls, now laughing, found the chase thrilling. Later, Jimmie warned them about tramps in the area. Grace plotted revenge against the sophomores, but nothing seemed practical. The friends, including Anne, attended a flying machine exhibition together.|"[""1.

"They were all quite thrilled about this new experience. While there had been many balloon ascensions at the State Fair and a dirigible airship had once passed over Oakdale, witnessing a real flying machine was like entering a different world where progress had moved much faster. ""Indeed,"" replied the young man, ""and I trust you will excel as a pupil, unlike Reddy Brooks who had a mishap due to forgetting how to manage the brakes."" A few others gathered in the spacious gymnasium for the exhibition, but the girls noticed they were part of an exclusive group. Among them was Miriam Nesbit, who arrived late with her mother. The show began with six young airship builders showcasing their summer projects. Despite Miriam's anger towards her brother, the models flew gracefully, except for David's unique design, which unfortunately crashed. Anne expressed a desire to leave discreetly through a side entrance to avoid a person waiting at the front.

A commotion followed as the maskers gathered at one end of the room as instructed by the six dominoes, hinting at a surprise for the sophomores. An eager silence fell as the six dominoes revealed their true identities, causing chaos. Before the sophomores could react, horns blared, lights went out, and the intruders fled.

The hideous effigy of Miss Leece stood where her abductors left it, with a green veil fluttering. Though meant for jest, it caused trouble. The placard on it indicated trouble brewing. Miss Thompson, the Girls' High School principal, removed it. An uneasy quiet loomed as the storm awaited its cue. In algebra class, Miss Leece dismissed Anne, but Grace stood up for her friend.
