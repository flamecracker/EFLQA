After George IV passed away in 1830, a new era began in English politics with William IV taking the throne. Although not as gifted as his brother, William IV had a more respectable character and embraced liberal views. His reign marked the House of Commons' dominance in national affairs, where the king's role was symbolic rather than governing. The political landscape saw a shift towards reform as influential figures like Lords Grey, Althorp, and Russell, along with orators like Brougham and Macaulay, pushed for change. The working class faced severe hardships with reduced wages and high bread prices, leading to riots and unrest. The poor economic conditions, exacerbated by heavy taxes, unfair laws, and limited political representation, resulted in widespread poverty and social injustice. The aristocracy's control over Parliament led to a lack of true representation for the nation's people.|"[""1.

During a period of peace following a time of war, the public began to realize their lack of political power and started advocating for changes. A few noble and capable politicians from the more liberal party raised concerns in Parliament about the existing issues, but their efforts were mainly symbolic. They were a minority facing a majority in the House of Commons resistant to reform. The reformers' only recourse was to agitate, hold meetings, and influence public opinion to elect members favorable to change. Eventually, due to the reformers' efforts, a new set of Parliament members committed to reform were elected. This led to the Whigs coming into power under Lord Grey, who was known for his support of parliamentary reform. The reform movement was a significant chapter in English history, with the struggle to redefine representation in Parliament being a central theme.|"['1.

Lord John Russell introduced the bill, which passed its second reading on January 17, 1832, with a significant majority. Despite opposition tactics of obstruction, the bill passed the House on March 23. The pivotal question arose: What would the Lords do? The creation of new peers was considered to ensure the bill's passage, despite opposition from the king. Eventually, the bill passed the House of Lords on June 4, marking a victory for the middle classes' protest against longstanding injustices. Henry Brougham played a significant role in paving the way for these reforms, although his later career was marked by controversy.

The government's inability to address the issue led to delays and attempts to avoid the problem. A commission was tasked with assessing the situation in Ireland and reporting to Parliament, highlighting the Catholic population's grievances due to inequality. The ongoing Irish Church disputes, particularly regarding tithes, posed challenges. Efforts to abolish the tithe system entirely were discussed, but a new bill aimed for clergy to accept less than their entitlement. The Coercion Act renewal and political shifts, including Lord Grey's resignation and Lord Melbourne's appointment, added to the complexity. Despite various attempts, the Irish issues persisted through successive Parliaments. However, progress was made in England, notably the abolition of slavery in the West Indies in 1833, showcasing advancements in addressing social injustices.|"['1.

O'Connell's passing did not halt the ongoing struggles in Ireland, which have persisted with varying intensity since then. It seems that for Ireland to be part of the empire, it should either govern itself, be granted equal rights as England, or face strict control, which would lead to a decline in its population. The path to order and peace in Ireland may lie in granting it fair treatment, a challenge due to English biases against change. In 1844, Lord Ashley advocated for limiting labor hours, leading to positive changes in child labor laws. Financially, Sir Robert Peel's reforms boosted the country's prosperity, including reducing interest rates and renewing the Bank of England's charter. Peel also aimed to appease Irish Catholics by increasing funding for Maynooth College and national education. Additionally, he tackled the contentious corn laws, championing free trade despite opposition from agricultural interests. In Manchester, the free-trade movement gained momentum, led by figures like Richard Cobden and John Bright, who tirelessly promoted their cause through public lectures and publications, ultimately sparking a significant national debate.|"[""1.

In the mid-19th century in England, a significant movement emerged to challenge the protectionist doctrine that imposed high prices on breadstuffs, causing widespread misery and social unrest. Advocates like Cobden and Bright tirelessly campaigned for free trade, gathering massive public support through petitions and public meetings. Despite initial setbacks, the Free-Trade League gained momentum, attracting converts from all social classes. The movement's success was evident when even the conservative Sir Robert Peel, a long-time protectionist, embraced free-trade principles in 1846. Peel's bold decision to gradually reduce duties on essential goods, including corn, marked a turning point in British economic policy. The public outcry for immediate repeal intensified as poor harvests and the Irish potato famine exacerbated the suffering of the working class. Ultimately, the shift towards free trade prevailed, demonstrating the power of reason and public advocacy in shaping economic policies.|['1.

Before the bill to repeal the corn laws was passed by the House of Lords, Sir Robert Peel's administration abruptly ended. The government introduced an Irish coercion bill, which was opposed by Irish followers of O'Connell and many Liberals. Radical members like Cobden and Bright opposed it too. The protectionists, along with Liberals and Irish members, threw out the bill, causing the government to resign. Peel retired gracefully, acknowledging the criticism he faced but also hoping to be remembered for the corn-law reform. O'Connell, in his last speech, highlighted the misery in Ireland due to famine.

In England, reforms have historically been achieved through reason and intelligence rather than violence. While France has seen violent uprisings, England's upper and middle classes have effectively suppressed mobs, avoiding significant bloodshed. Reforms in England, starting from Cromwell's time, have been peaceful and gradual, addressing pressing needs and injustices rather than aiming for radical equality. These reforms have always been carried out through Parliament. Movements like the People's Charter in 1838 failed due to impracticality and lack of popular support. The Chartist movement in 1848, despite initial momentum, collapsed due to exaggerated expectations and forged petitions. Subsequent reforms, like the repeal of corn laws and the promotion of free trade, have been achieved peacefully through Parliament, leading to improvements in people's lives. Sir Robert Peel, a respected statesman, played a significant role in these reforms, despite his reserved nature and lack of favor among artists and literary figures. His pragmatic approach and administrative abilities were valued, and his accidental death in 1850 was mourned as a national loss.|"[""1.

Sir Robert Peel, a respected English minister, was highly esteemed by the Duke of Wellington for his advice and cooperation. Despite his success in advancing the country's material interests, Peel was not a popular figure due to his reserved nature, often misunderstood as pride. He focused on politics, associating with fellow politicians and rewarding merit in the Church and literature. Peel's reputation as a statesman is enduring, evident in recent biographies written about him. His significance lies in his role as a parliamentary leader, not branching out into other fields like law or literature. The unification of Italy under Victor Emmanuel marked a significant event in European history, politically uniting the country while leaving spiritual power in the hands of the Pope. The Pope's spiritual authority remains strong, especially over Roman Catholic countries, emphasizing obedience to the Church.|"[""1.

The liberation and unity of Italy by a group of patriots, with the help of friendly powers, aimed at political freedom. The Pope lost his temporal dominion but retained his ecclesiastical authority. The revolution under Victor Emmanuel's rule was a political movement, not religious. Communists and infidels fought for political rights, not religious motives. Italy's transformation to a Catholic nation post-revolution was due to political, not religious, changes. Patriots like D'Azeglio, Mazzini, and Garibaldi, along with support from friendly nations, led the revolution. Italians sought personal freedom and a united Italy, driven by a desire for change and patriotism.

"The Italian revolution began in 1820 with secret societies like the Carbonari aiming to challenge despotic rulers. The Carbonari, formed in Naples, led uprisings in Naples and Piedmont, which were crushed by Austrian forces. Promises of constitutional government made by Napoleon in 1796 were never fulfilled. Despite suppression, the spirit of Italian liberty persisted through various societies, but lacked clear goals. Charles Albert of Sardinia, a ruler torn between liberal and conservative factions, brought reforms but hesitated to embrace revolution. Mazzini, a passionate advocate for Italian liberation, founded ""Young Italy"" to promote republican ideals. His dedication to freedom led to imprisonment and exile as he sought support for the cause.

Giuseppe Mazzini, an Italian patriot, founded the Association of Young Italy, attracting many young supporters. The association advocated Liberty, Equality, Humanity, Independence, and Unity as core beliefs. Mazzini promoted education and insurrection, rather than violence, as the means to achieve these goals. He envisioned a united Italy under a republican government, which faced opposition due to the challenges of unifying various states. Despite setbacks, including a failed invasion of Savoy, Mazzini persisted in his efforts for Italian unity. Forced into exile, he sought refuge in England, where he faced hardships but maintained his principles. Marquis Massimo d'Azeglio, an advocate for a constitutional monarchy, offered a contrasting viewpoint to Mazzini's republican ideals.

"It was the goal of D'Azeglio to influence an enlightened public opinion on acknowledged issues without inciting revolutionary uprisings, which he did not believe in. He, like other Italian patriots, sought to rid his country of foreign rule, earning the disapproval of both Metternich and Mazzini. Metternich mocked the notion of Italian unity, dismissing Italy as merely a ""geographical expression."" What he deemed impossible is now a reality. However, his judgment of the papacy was more astute. He asserted that a ""liberal Pope"" was unattainable. The Popes, regardless of their names, have adamantly resisted all reforms advocated by Italian statesmen, with the Jesuits' motto of ""Let us remain as we are, or let us exist no longer"" echoing their stance. Despite initial hopes placed in Pius IX., any expectations of reform under his reign faded soon after he assumed power in 1846.

Cavour was a man of practical intellect and boundless energy. His wisdom matched his work ethic, and his patriotism burned brightly. He hailed from a noble family in Piedmont and initially served in the army. However, his liberal views led to suspicion and limited opportunities. He then delved into business and agriculture, all while advocating for constitutional liberty. In the political arena, he pushed for war against Austria and became a key figure in the Sardinian government. Cavour's strategic alliance with France and England against Austria was a masterstroke.

During the mid-1800s, Louis Napoleon showed genuine interest in supporting the Italians to break free from Austrian rule. Despite his political wrongdoings, his personal feelings leaned towards Italy. Influenced by his past alliances and family background, he favored uniting the Latin races. Louis Napoleon was enticed by Cavour to acquire Savoy and Nice, offering these regions to France to fortify its southern borders. In return, Victor Emmanuel would gain Venetia and Lombardy from Austria, doubling his subjects and asserting dominance in northern Italy. Cavour persuaded Louis Napoleon that sacrificing Savoy for a more powerful Italy was essential. This led to secret negotiations between Napoleon III and Cavour, resulting in a plan for Sardinia to wage war on Austria with French support, aiming for Italian independence and unity. Cavour collaborated with Italian patriots, including Garibaldi, to achieve this goal, despite the French emperor's disapproval of their involvement.|"[""1.

During the mid-1800s, Italy was embroiled in revolutionary movements. Giuseppe Garibaldi, a passionate patriot, was deeply affected by the news of reform and decided to return to Italy in 1848 to join the fight for freedom. Initially rejected by King Charles Albert, Garibaldi organized a force to defend Milan against Austrian forces. Despite setbacks, he later joined the resistance in Venice and Rome, where he fought against the French who sought to restore papal power. Garibaldi's valiant efforts were met with challenges, forcing him to flee and seek refuge in various places, including San Marino and Caprera.

In 1859, under Cavour's guidance, Italian and French politics became more intertwined, focusing on the war with Austria and the formation of an Italian kingdom. Victor Emmanuel publicly declared his support for Venice and Lombardy against Austria. Garibaldi, summoned by Cavour, led volunteers in the fight for Italian independence. Despite military mistakes, Garibaldi's bravery gained recognition. Eventually, Italy's defeat of Austria led to a confederation of Italian States under the Papal Protectorate and the cession of Lombardy to Sardinia. Displeased with the inconclusive results, Cavour resigned but later resumed his role. The Italian states repudiated France's arrangements, voting for annexation to Sardinia. Ricasoli of Tuscany played a crucial role in this annexation. Garibaldi then focused on liberating Naples and Sicily from Ferdinand's oppressive rule. Mazzini, Cavour, and Garibaldi, each with different visions, contributed to the liberation of Southern Italy.|"[""1.

In 1860, Garibaldi took the first step towards the Sicilian revolution. Departing from Genoa with a thousand men, he aimed to support the Sicilian insurrectionists. While Cavour outwardly opposed Garibaldi's expedition, he secretly favored it. Turin's government refrained from direct involvement to appease foreign Powers. Lord John Russell of England supported Garibaldi, aiding him against Neapolitan forces. Garibaldi landed in Sicily, rallying support and defeating Neapolitan troops. Victorious, he became Dictator of Sicily. Moving to the mainland, he seized Reggio and made his way to Naples. Garibaldi's popularity ensured a bloodless conquest, with King Francis II. fleeing. Despite disorder in Naples, Garibaldi hesitated to impose control. Mazzini's arrival added further complexity, as Garibaldi distanced himself from the republican's ideals.

Despite facing resistance from French troops in Rome, Victor Emmanuel pushed forward and united the North and South of Italy. Garibaldi, having achieved his goal of freeing Naples, surrendered his dictatorship to Victor Emmanuel. He requested to march on Rome to confront the Pope, but the king declined. Victor Emmanuel's prime minister, Cavour, who played a crucial role in unifying Italy, tragically succumbed to illness. Italy, except Venice and Rome, united under Victor Emmanuel's rule. Cavour passed away witnessing the realization of a unified Italy.|"['1.

Rome and Venice were still outside. The Pope remained inflexible to any reforms, any changes, any improvements. On the 7th of September, 1860, Victor Emmanuel sent an envoy to Rome to demand from his Holiness the dismissal of his foreign troops; which demand was refused. In less than three weeks the campaign was over, and General Lamoricière, who commanded the papal troops, was compelled to surrender. Austria, Prussia, and Russia protested; but Victor Emmanuel paid little heed to the protest, or to the excommunications which were hurled against him. The Emperor of the French found it politic to withdraw his ambassador from Turin, but adhered to his policy of non-intervention, and remained a quiet spectator. The English government, on the other hand, justified the government of Turin in thus freeing Italian territory from foreign troops. In 1866, while Austria was embroiled with Prussia, Victor Emmanuel, having formed an alliance with the Northern Powers, invaded Venetia; and in the settlement between the two German Powers the Venetian province fell to the King of Italy. In 1867 Garibaldi made another attempt on Rome, but was arrested near Lake Thrasimene and sent back to Caprera. It was not until Louis Napoleon was defeated at Sedan that the French troops were withdrawn from Rome, and the way was finally opened for the occupation of the city by the troops of Victor Emmanuel in |"[""1.

Italy, despite achieving political unity and independence, faces challenges that hinder its progress. High taxation burdens the population disproportionately, hindering economic growth. Widespread ignorance, especially in central and southern regions, limits educational opportunities. The influence of the Pope maintains spiritual control over the majority, perpetuating outdated beliefs. Italy lacks the cultural and economic advancement seen in France, Germany, and England due to a focus on military expansion rather than resource development. However, recent government reforms and the presence of a constitutional monarch offer hope for positive change. The desire to emulate the success of European neighbors drives Italy's ambitions, particularly in seeking control over Constantinople for religious and strategic reasons.|"[""1.

During Catherine II's reign, Russia expanded by adding the Crimea and dismembering Poland. Despite her ambitions to establish a Greek empire, her plans were thwarted by Austria. Catherine's immoralities tainted her reign, which ended in 1796. Her son Paul was assassinated, and Alexander I succeeded him in 1801. Alexander expanded Russia's territory by acquiring the duchy of Warsaw and other regions. His reign focused on suppressing revolutionary ideas and extending Russian influence. After his death in 1825, Nicholas became the ruler. Under Nicholas, Russia engaged in wars with Persia and Turkey, leading to territorial gains and the peace of Adrianople in 1829. This treaty secured extensive territories and navigation rights for Russia, marking significant advancements for the empire.|"[""1.

During the reign of Nicholas, Russia expanded its territories, making him one of the most powerful rulers worldwide. As the Czar of all the Russias, Nicholas faced few constraints within his dominions but was restrained by European governments wary of his ambitions. Initially respected in Europe for his morals, family values, and religious devotion, Nicholas was known for his unwavering commitment to the Greek Church and his word. While not as impulsive as his brother Alexander, Nicholas was reliable and admired the Duke of Wellington as a model sovereign. However, his inflexible will, fiery temper, and growing distrust of advisors due to his absolute power led to a more suspicious, bitter, and cruel demeanor in his later years. Like many rulers before him, Nicholas faced challenges that tested his character and humility, ultimately revealing the burdens of absolute power.|"['1.

It is intriguing to note how few great rulers have enjoyed unchallenged rule until their final days. Many faced unexpected downfalls, like Napoleon, Louis Philippe, Metternich, and Gladstone, or unattained ambitions, such as those aspiring to the U.S. presidency. Nicholas believed Constantinople would easily fall to Russia, but after a century of conflict, this prize remained elusive. The obstacles to conquering Constantinople are immense. Russian advances through the Balkans were met with defeat and retreat, while other potential routes faced significant challenges. Despite his stern and relentless nature, Emperor Nicholas lacked military prowess. His focus on army discipline over strategy led to failed campaigns. Russia's strained relations with Turkey and interference in Egypt strained international relations, leading to potential conflicts. Emperor Nicholas's ambitions to conquer Constantinople remained unfulfilled despite strategic considerations.|"['1.

During the mid-19th century, a complex web of diplomatic maneuvers unfolded in Europe. At the center of this intricate dance were England, Russia, and France. England, under the peaceful leadership of Lord Aberdeen, found itself reluctantly drawn into a confrontation with Russia over the fate of Turkey. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, a skilled diplomat, played a crucial role in guiding Turkey to resist Russian encroachments. Meanwhile, France, under Louis Napoleon, sought to bolster his shaky rule by joining forces with England against Russia. The stage was set for a conflict that would test alliances and ambitions. As tensions mounted, the prospect of war became increasingly likely, much to the dismay of some leaders and the delight of others. The intricate political landscape of Europe was about to be reshaped by the unfolding events of the Crimean War.|['1.

In the past, there was a fierce competition for control over the sacred sites in the Holy Land. Even before the Mohammedans took over Palestine, pilgrimages to these shrines were a significant aspect of the Middle Ages. The rivalry between the Greek and Latin convents in Jerusalem over the guardianship of the Holy Sepulchre and other sacred sites was intense. The Turkish government played a crucial role in deciding which church, Greek or Latin, would have authority over these shrines. This decision sparked ongoing disputes, with Russia supporting the Greek convents and France backing the Latin convents. Tensions escalated, leading to threats of war between Russia and France, with England stepping in to mediate and prevent further conflict. The situation eventually spiraled into Russia invading the Danubian principalities in 1853, triggering widespread unrest in Europe.|"['1.

In 1853, tensions in Europe escalated as Russia's invasion of the principalities drew strong opposition from Austria and other European nations. The Czar faced mounting pressure when France and England positioned their fleets at the Dardanelles. Russia, realizing the gravity of the situation, had to resume negotiations. A note drafted in Vienna by four major powers made it clear that resistance against Russia would be united if the troops were not withdrawn from the principalities. Turkey, supported by a council of prominent figures, declared war when Russia failed to comply within the given timeframe. The conflict was fueled by religious and patriotic fervor, with both sides rallying their people for the impending struggle.

Lord Raglan, a seasoned English commander, was appointed to lead the English army in the Crimean War.

On the French side, Marshal Saint-Arnaud, known for his bold and reckless nature, was entrusted with the French forces. Both leaders faced challenges due to their health and backgrounds but were expected to excel in their roles.

In July and August, the allied armies faced disaster in Varna due to a dreadful pestilence, not battles. The troops were severely weakened, prompting a decision to sail for Crimea and land near Sebastopol, a crucial objective. The French and Turks, along with the English, totaling about sixty-four thousand men, marched towards Sebastopol with the support of fleets. The march was challenging, lacking supplies and facing an unknown enemy. The allies crossed the Alma River, attacked the Russian positions, and emerged victorious, albeit with significant losses. The battle showcased military genius and bravery on both sides. Despite the victory, a delayed advance to Sebastopol allowed the Russians to fortify the city, leading to a prolonged and challenging flank movement before reaching the south of Sebastopol.

During the Crimean War, the allied forces faced challenges in capturing Sebastopol. The Star Fort, a key defense, was deemed vulnerable by Todleben, Lord Raglan, and Sir Edmund Lyons. Despite this, the allies faced critical conditions due to unfamiliar terrain and the enemy's sea control. After a laborious march to Balaklava, the English army regrouped. Saint-Arnaud's illness led to Marshal Canrobert taking command. The Russians, led by Prince Mentchikof, sank their ships to fortify Sebastopol. The allies delayed attacking to await siege guns, giving Todleben time to strengthen defenses. When the bombardment began, the city held strong. In the Battle of Balaklava, the Light Brigade suffered heavy losses due to a misinterpreted order. The Heavy Brigade, led by General Scarlett, executed a daring charge against Russian forces.

During the Crimean War, the allies faced a series of calamities and sufferings that were unprecedented in the history of warfare. A terrible storm on November 14th destroyed soldiers' tents and twenty-one vessels carrying vital supplies to the hungry army near Balaklava. The troops lacked suitable clothing, fuel, provisions, and medicines for the harsh winter campaign on the Black Sea. The loss of the main road to the camp worsened the situation, forcing supplies to be carried on muddy tracks by exhausted mules and horses. The soldiers, sick and disheartened, faced uncooked provisions and harsh conditions. The dreadful state of the hospitals in the Levant, where thousands perished, prompted women like Florence Nightingale to volunteer and organize nursing services.

After Canrobert was replaced by Pélissier, a fierce battle took place on June 18, but the Russians repelled the assault, leading to an extended siege. Lord Raglan's passing left General Simpson in command. The French and Sardinians achieved a crucial victory on August 16, preventing Sebastopol from receiving external aid.

Napoleon, a towering figure in history, possessed remarkable military prowess and ambition. His influence shaped Europe for a quarter-century, leaving an indelible mark. His nephew, Napoleon III, sought to emulate him but fell short due to numerous mistakes. Despite some benefits to France, his reign ended in defeat. Born into a prestigious lineage, Louis Napoleon faced many setbacks before becoming President of France in 1848. His unexpected rise to power surprised many, with the peasantry's enduring admiration for the Napoleon name playing a significant role.

During his presidency, nothing significant happened except for his disagreements with the Assembly over constitutional matters. The President and the Assembly were both wary of the radical groups, such as the ultra-democrats and Red Republicans, who were spreading their ideas among the urban population. The Assembly's attempt to restrict voting rights made them unpopular, while Louis Napoleon gained favor for maintaining law and order. As his term neared its end, the President grew anxious and started planning to extend his rule. He sought a constitutional revision to allow his re-election, but the Assembly, suspicious of his motives, did not comply. To achieve his goal, he turned to the army, but faced opposition from key generals, including Changarnier. Louis Napoleon then plotted with his confidant Major Fleury to secure loyal military leaders, ultimately appointing Saint-Arnaud as Minister of War through deceit and manipulation. This strategic move set the stage for his planned coup d'état.|"['1.

In September 1851, everything was set for a significant event, but Saint-Arnaud advised the President to delay the action until winter when all the lawmakers would be in Paris and easier to capture. The Assembly was full of influential figures who opposed the Republic's ruler, so capturing them was crucial to prevent a civil war. The President waited patiently until winter. Suddenly, on the night of December 2nd, police arrested prominent members of the Assembly, including Changarnier, Cavaignac, and Thiers. The military secured key locations in Paris, and Morny became the Minister of the Interior. The Assembly was dissolved, and universal suffrage was restored. Louis Napoleon's speeches convinced the army, while resistance from Republicans led to barricades and clashes with General Magnan's forces. Ultimately, Louis Napoleon consolidated power, becoming Emperor in December 1852 through a popular vote.|"['1.

Louis Napoleon was a thoughtful and observant man who learned much from his time in England and interactions with politicians and philosophers. He realized that to maintain his throne, he needed to keep the people entertained and engaged. This led him to change France's foreign policy and invest heavily in public works to create jobs and boost the country's development. Initially seen as a madman during his early attempts to seize power, Louis Napoleon eventually rose to become President and then Emperor of France. Despite his reserved demeanor and lack of obvious intellectual gifts, he demonstrated a deep understanding of French history and politics. He skillfully used short, impactful speeches and projected an image of peace and sympathy for the common people, while secretly harboring ambitions of war and despotism.

The argument between the Greek and Latin monks over the sacred sites in Jerusalem caused a disturbance in Europe. The French leader, siding with the Latin monks, opposed the Emperor Nicholas, a staunch believer in the Greek faith. The French sought to rally the nation in a crusade, not just for religious artifacts but to support Turkey against Russian aggression. Louis Napoleon aimed to prevent Russia from gaining control over Constantinople and the Black Sea. The Emperor Nicholas, with a million soldiers, posed a threat to Europe due to his territorial ambitions. France, along with Austria, Prussia, and England, united against Russia to maintain the balance of power. Louis Napoleon, influenced by his advisors, sought an alliance with England to confront Russia, despite historical tensions.

A man with a warlike and interfering foreign policy eagerly adopted the schemes of the French emperor, leading to a warlike stance with Russia. Despite efforts for peace by Lord Aberdeen, war became inevitable due to the resolve of Louis Napoleon and Palmerston. The war was popular in England, and the alliance with Napoleon III. brought social prestige. The war aimed to assist the Turks in defending Constantinople. Although peace could have been declared honorably, England and France were determined to take Sebastopol. Louis Napoleon proved a faithful ally, continuing the costly war for the interests of England and France.

During the reign of Louis Napoleon in France, the emperor faced challenges from various political factions like the Orléanists, Legitimists, and Republicans. Despite the discontent and sedition prevalent among the old government leaders, Napoleon III.'s reign lasted longer than his predecessors like Louis XVIII. and Charles X. combined. The emperor's reign, marked by enormous debts and casualties from wars, ultimately led to his downfall due to his selfish ambition and disregard for public welfare. Ambitious monarchs like Napoleon III. who prioritize personal gain over the interests of their country often face dire consequences.

Napoleon III's involvement in Italy's affairs was significant. Austria's interference in Italian States was seen as a threat to Europe. The conflict escalated when Austria crossed the river Ticino, prompting French and Sardinian troops to prepare for battle. The war was brief, resulting in Austrian defeats and the cession of Lombardy to Sardinia. Napoleon III's military successes elevated his fame, but his administration faced challenges. His intervention in Mexico alongside England and Spain led to the establishment of a monarchy with Archduke Maximilian. However, France's prolonged presence in Mexico strained relations with the United States. Napoleon III's reputation suffered as the Mexican monarchy collapsed, leading to Maximilian's tragic fate. His health declined, and internal affairs, influenced by the Catholic Church, eroded his popularity. His attempt to acquire Luxemburg backfired, sparking tensions with Prussia.

In 1870, France faced isolation and the looming threat of war with Prussia. The French emperor sought alliances with Austria and Italy but found little support due to past conflicts. Napoleon III's administration was plagued by corruption and inefficiency, leaving the nation ill-prepared for war. The spark that ignited the conflict was French interference in the Spanish throne nomination. Despite initial concessions, Prussia refused further demands from France. The French government's arrogance and ignorance of their military weaknesses led to a fatal declaration of hostilities. The French forces, led by incompetent generals, were no match for the well-prepared Prussian army. Battles like Worth and Gravelotte highlighted the French army's inadequacies, culminating in the surrender of the entire French army, including the emperor, at Sedan.

Before presenting Bismarck, it will be necessary to look at the work of those great men who prepared the way not only for him but also for the soldier Moltke. These were men who lifted Prussia from the humiliation caused by her defeat by Napoleon. Prussia's defeat was total and unexpected, even greater than France's after the later Franco-Prussian war. The kingdom was dismembered, its provinces seized, and its population reduced to less than four million. The king was exiled, and the country was occupied by French soldiers. Prussia had no allies and was isolated. However, the escape of Prussia was due to the need for Napoleon to focus on Spain, and the talents of patriots like Stein, Hardenberg, and Scharnhorst who reorganized the country's administration, foreign affairs, and military power. Their efforts laid the foundation for the anti-Napoleonic revolution.|"[""1.

During the early 19th century, Baron von Stein played a crucial role in transforming Prussia. He pushed for reforms that abolished serfdom, opened up opportunities for citizens in various professions, and allowed the citizen class to join the military. Stein's vision was to foster a sense of German national identity over Prussian loyalty, laying the groundwork for the eventual unification of Germany. Despite facing exile and financial ruin at the hands of Napoleon, Stein's influence extended to aiding Russia and shaping the downfall of the French despot. Alongside Stein, Count Hardenberg supported similar ideals, although he was more diplomatic and socially accepted. The educational movement led by William, Baron von Humboldt, further elevated Prussia by establishing the University of Berlin and promoting liberal sentiments. Additionally, Scharnhorst's military reforms, including the _levee en masse_, transformed Prussia into a formidable military power by ensuring all citizens had a stake in defending their nation.|"['1.

During the reign of Frederick William III, Prussia underwent significant changes that laid the foundation for its future greatness. The system implemented by Scharnhorst and Stein transformed Prussia into a nation of patriots and soldiers, making it nearly invincible against powerful enemies. The dreamy middle class and peasants were turned into an effective soldiery, no longer subjected to corporal punishment. The new system kindled patriotic ardor among all classes, restoring dignity to the nation. Despite the king's jealousy and timidity, he recognized the excellence of the system and generously rewarded its creators. Under Prussia's new military monarchy, alliances were formed with other powers, leading to the creation of the German Confederation for defensive purposes. This period of reform and prosperity saw the flourishing of industry, education, and culture, making Prussia the most intellectually cultivated country in Europe. However, the rapid advancement in learning also led to discontent and increased crime rates, prompting the Diet to tighten control and suppress revolutionary movements.|"[""1.

By 1818, a strong conservative movement was evident in Europe, especially in Prussia and Austria. The King of Prussia reneged on his promise of a constitutional government, while Austria, under Metternich's influence, cracked down on intellectual and national freedoms. This backlash against progress extended throughout Europe, stifling liberal movements. In Prussia, economic advancements like free trade within the Confederation and the establishment of the Zollverein in 1839 were notable, but political reforms were lacking. Frederick William III's death in 1840 ushered in his son, Frederick William IV, who made limited concessions for constitutional liberties, including partial press freedom and Zollverein expansion. Despite these small steps, true representative government was still a distant prospect in Germany. The National Diet convened in 1847, comprising different classes, but with limited legislative power, as the monarchy retained political control.|"['1.

During a time of political fervor and economic growth, Otto von Bismarck emerged in the political arena as a member of the National Diet. The period was marked by railway expansion, the Zollverein's reach in North Germany, and flourishing universities. Thirty-four years of peace had united the German States. The prevalent idea was political franchise, with a push for democratic participation. Bismarck, from a noble but modest family, initially led a reckless life, but later showed promise in his profession of law. His friendship with the American John Motley was notable. Despite a wild youth, Bismarck passed his State examination and embarked on a career in law enforcement and military service. His marriage to Johanna von Putkammer marked a turning point, and his entry into the Landtag signaled the beginning of his illustrious political journey.|"['1.

No account of the man would be complete without recognizing the cornerstone of his character - an unwavering belief in the feudalistic right of royalty to govern its subjects. Descended from an ancient family of knights and statesmen, deeply aristocratic and conservative, his inherited instincts and formidable will, along with his colossal physique, solidified his loyalty to the king and monarchy. In the National Diet of 1847, Herr von Bismarck initially remained silent, but when he spoke, he staunchly supported the crown's power. Despite not being a polished orator, he boldly opposed liberal reforms, including the emancipation of the Jews, earning favor with the monarch. In 1851, Bismarck served as the first secretary of the Prussian embassy to the Diet of the German States, where he staunchly upheld the absolute power of the crown. His originality, fearlessness, and devotion to the monarchy marked him for leadership.|"[""1.

Bismarck, a man of brusque manners and a lieutenant of militia, faced criticism when appointed to a diplomatic post. Despite this, the king recognized his abilities. Bismarck found life in Frankfort dull and held contempt for his diplomatic colleagues. He quickly assessed their characters and found them lacking. His exceptional qualities soon became evident, gaining the king's and General Rochow's approval. His friendship with the Prince of Prussia laid the foundation for his future successes. Bismarck's encounters with Metternich revealed their contrasting aims and personalities. At Frankfort, he closely observed political affairs, advocating for Prussia's dominance.

In 1859, Bismarck became the Prussian ambassador to Russia at the age of forty-three. Known for his animosity towards Austria, Bismarck's casual yet arrogant demeanor was a stark contrast to his formal predecessors. Despite his modest salary compared to other ambassadors, he and his down-to-earth wife were popular in Russian high society. In 1861, after the death of Frederick William IV, Bismarck was called back to Berlin to advise the new Prince Regent, William I. Tasked with countering the Liberal party's influence, Bismarck was later sent to Paris to study Napoleon and French affairs. Upon returning to Berlin, he assumed the role of President of the Ministry, determined to strengthen Prussia and diminish Austria's power. Bismarck faced opposition from the Liberal party but remained resolute in his mission to elevate Prussia, even if it meant resorting to drastic measures.|"[""1.

In November 1863, after the death of King Frederick VII of Denmark, a dispute over the rule of the Danish provinces of Schleswig and Holstein arose in Europe. Denmark had agreed in the 1852 London treaty to keep the duchies autonomous. However, just before his death, Frederick VII dissolved this autonomy and merged Schleswig, partly German, with Denmark, leaving Holstein, entirely German, as it was. Bismarck protested this move as a breach of treaty. When the Danish parliament incorporated Schleswig, a German prince, Frederick of Augustenburg, claimed the duchies. Bismarck convinced Austria to join Prussia in seizing the provinces. They invaded, defeated Danish forces, and divided the territory. Despite protests from England and other German states, Bismarck's cunning plan succeeded. The Treaty of Vienna in 1864 decided that Denmark would surrender Schleswig-Holstein and Lauenburg to Austria and Prussia. Austria and Prussia agreed to divide the duchies, averting war temporarily with the Convention of Gastein.|"[""1.

The Berlin Chamber declared the treaty null as it was not ratified by the country. Bismarck, defending the king's sovereignty, clashed with liberal Chamber members seeking a more democratic constitution. Bismarck dissolved the Chamber, stating it dealt only with commerce and tax matters, not politics. This unpopular move led to an attempt on his life. Prussia and Austria prepared for war over conflicting ambitions, seeking alliances with Russia and France. Prussia prevented a united Austrian front by occupying key regions. Count von Moltke orchestrated Prussia's forces, outmaneuvering Austria in the decisive Battle of Königgrätz.

In 1867, a conflict began to brew when Napoleon III attempted to buy the Duchy of Luxemburg from the King of Holland. Luxemburg, although inhabited by Germans, was a personal fief of the King of Holland and a member of the Germanic Confederation. The fortress in Luxemburg, defended by Prussian troops, posed a threat to France's northeastern border. Napoleon III offered a large sum of money for the duchy and a general protectorate of Holland against Prussian aggression. However, when an alliance between southern and northern German states made Prussia dominant, the King of Holland declined Napoleon's proposal. This refusal angered Napoleon and the French nation. To avoid immediate war, Napoleon proposed arbitration, leading to a conference in London where Prussia agreed to withdraw its garrison from Luxemburg and dismantle the fortress.

During the time leading up to the war between Prussia and France, both countries were secretly preparing for the conflict. French spies were active in the Rhineland, while German draughtsmen were working in Alsace-Lorraine. France armed its soldiers with the chassepot gun and developed a new weapon called the _mitrailleuse_. With 450,000 troops ready to advance on the Rhine provinces, France appeared poised for victory. However, Prussia had been organizing its armies for 40 years and had 450,000 well-prepared soldiers, including a strong cavalry force. The war was sparked by a diplomatic incident involving the French ambassador to Berlin, Benedetti. This led to Napoleon declaring war on Prussia. The German forces mobilized swiftly under the leadership of Moltke, culminating in a decisive victory at Sedan. Paris then endured a five-month siege before surrendering to the Germans.|['1.

Bismarck, the influential statesman, believed in the necessity of maintaining a strong military force to protect Germany from potential threats. He emphasized the importance of being prepared for any unforeseen hostilities, given the historical crises that almost drew Prussia into wars. Despite not fearing immediate conflicts, Bismarck stressed the need for a robust army to deter any potential attacks from neighboring nations like France and Russia. He argued that Germany, lacking natural defenses, needed a well-equipped military to ensure its safety. Bismarck's policy aimed to foster peace through strength, deterring aggression by demonstrating Germany's military capability. While his internal governance faced challenges, his diplomatic prowess and dedication to securing Germany's position in Europe were his defining legacies.

"The creator of his nation's greatness, however, was too deeply respected by his fellow citizens to stay in obscurity. After over three years of retirement, Bismarck was invited by the young emperor on January 26, 1894, to visit the imperial palace in Berlin. His journey and reception in the capital were met with joyous public celebrations. When the emperor greeted him, the reconciliation was complete. Though Bismarck did not return to office, the emperor frequently praised him in public addresses. On his seventy-ninth birthday, he received a letter and a steel cuirass from the emperor as a symbol of German gratitude. The castle at Friederichsruh was filled with gifts from all over Germany, and ""Bismarck banquets"" were held in major cities.

On January 29, 1833, at just 24 years old, Gladstone began his remarkable career in Parliament during Lord Grey's ministry. His first speech was during a debate about ending slavery in British colonies. He argued for gradual emancipation and fair treatment of slaves as private property. Despite opposition, the Parliament eventually passed a law granting freedom to all born after August 1, 1834, and those older after a six-year apprenticeship. Gladstone later opposed reducing the number of Irish bishops and imposing taxes on larger livings. Despite his young age, he served as under-secretary for the Colonies. Gladstone's eloquence and conservative views on church matters made him stand out. His oratory skills were recognized during debates on West India emancipation in 1838, where he argued against immediate abolition. While his appearance and manner were favorable, his speeches were meticulously prepared, showing his dedication to mastering his subjects.|"[""1.

After Sir Robert Peel's accidental death in 1850, the conservative party fell apart, leading Mr. Gladstone to distance himself from both Whigs and Tories. He learned valuable lessons from Sir James Graham, a respected statesman, and focused on studying parliamentary tactics and major political issues. During the winter of 1850-51, he visited Italy again, not for leisure but to tend to his daughter's health. While in Naples, he examined the prisons with a philanthropic goal, shedding light on the oppressive Neapolitan government. His powerful letters to Lord Aberdeen exposed the despotism in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which sparked outrage across Europe and contributed to the downfall of the tyrannical King of Naples.

Mr. Gladstone disagreed with Lord Palmerston during the Crimean war, favoring a peaceful policy unlike the popular demand for war. Despite being exceptional in financial matters, he did not play a significant role in the war's management. His eloquence in financial matters was unparalleled, making even the minutest details captivating. After the coalition ministry's dissolution due to war mismanagement, Lord Palmerston became prime minister, with Mr. Gladstone excelling as finance minister. Gladstone's transition to a free-trader of the Manchester school marked a departure from his previous beliefs, leading to opposition from former allies. He later became an independent member of the House, actively supporting beneficial measures. The government's mistakes and financial burdens from the war led to its downfall, allowing the Conservatives to come into power briefly before a new coalition ministry under Lord Palmerston was formed, with Mr. Gladstone returning as chancellor of the exchequer.|"[""1.

In the mid-1800s, Mr. Gladstone, a prominent British politician, made a significant error regarding the American Civil War. He mistakenly believed that the Southern States, led by Jefferson Davis, had successfully become an independent nation. This opinion caused a stir in both England and the United States, leading to strained relations. Mr. Gladstone's sympathetic views towards the South, influenced by economic interests, disappointed many in America. Despite his esteemed status, some felt his stance favored slavery, contrasting England's efforts to abolish slavery in the West Indies. Over time, Gladstone shifted towards more liberal views, ultimately facing defeat in his constituency. This setback allowed him to focus on broader political issues, leading to his representation of South Lancashire. The passing of Lord Palmerston saw Gladstone resume his role as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Earl Russell's government. Concerns over Ireland's state led to a bill suspending the habeas corpus act, supported by Gladstone. Amidst political turmoil, the Reform Bill of 1866, aimed at extending voting rights, sparked heated debates and eventually led to the fall of the Liberal ministry.|"[""1.

In 1869, Mr. Gladstone addressed a critical issue in Ireland by introducing the Irish Land Bill in February 1870. The bill aimed to tackle the problem of insecure tenure, which hindered tenants' industry due to the fear of eviction and rent hikes. This uncertainty led to increased poverty and stagnant wages. The proposed solution was to extend leases to thirty-three years, allowing tenants to purchase lands they cultivated. The bill also extended the notice period for eviction to twelve months. Despite facing opposition, the government passed the bill on August 1, 1870. Mr. Gladstone further advanced reforms by abolishing the buying and selling of army commissions and introducing the secret ballot and equal access to universities. Despite these efforts, his policies faced resistance, leading to a decline in popularity.|['1.

After Mr. Gladstone retired, his political influence remained strong. He actively participated in discussions, especially on topics like the bill to regulate public worship. Even in his absence from the House of Commons, his impact was felt, and other leaders sought his advice. Meanwhile, Disraeli skillfully led his party, displaying tactical mastery and selecting ministers wisely. He focused on maintaining popularity rather than implementing significant reforms. After two years, due to declining health, Disraeli accepted a peerage and retired from the position of prime minister. During his retirement, Mr. Gladstone remained active, writing for various publications and contributing to new reviews. While his articles showcased his knowledge and ability, they were not as widely acclaimed as expected.
