"One sunny spring day, two children ventured out together. The May sun shone brightly, birds sang joyfully, flowers bloomed, and May bells rang. They laughed, danced, sang, and said, ""Oh, the bright May day! What does it matter if mother warns us? Who wants to stay home on this morning? Oh, the joyful May day!"" ""Oh dear, oh dear, it's almost nine. The birds sing, the sun shines. Poor Doll and I must go to school. I don't understand why, we dislike it so. I detest those letters. They twist and turn. There's no point in trying; I'll never learn. ""Hooray, hooray, it's finally two! I am so happy! What should we do? Come, Doll, let's run. I will never go, when I grow up, to school, I know; but every minute of the day, I'll spend just as I please, playing."""|"['1.
