Mountains are both beautiful and awe-inspiring. In the past, people were afraid of mountains because they didn't understand them. But now, we admire their beauty. Mountains are like the Earth's heart, made of hot, melted metals and stones. They are like bubbles that have escaped from the Earth's core. Mountains are filled with precious ores like gold and silver, and some even have underground rivers and lakes. The outside of a mountain is covered in plants and animals, but the inside holds mysterious caverns with gems and precious metals. Miners like Curdie and his father explore these caverns to find silver. The silver they find is used by the king for the good of the country, not for personal gain. Mountains are not just rocks; they are living, breathing parts of the Earth that provide us with precious resources and beauty.|"[""1.

Upon the mountain, there stood a grand old house where Princess Irene lived until she was nearly nine. The mountain was once inhabited by troublesome creatures called goblins, but thanks to Curdie, their plans were foiled. The king, impressed by Curdie's bravery, asked him to join them, but Curdie chose to stay with his family. The king departed with his daughter, leaving a sense of gloom. Curdie's parents felt they had hindered his opportunity for greatness by keeping him with them. In the evenings, Curdie's mother often spoke of the princess's great-great-grandmother, a mysterious figure involved in past events. Curdie had doubts about the existence of this person, as he had never seen her. Despite this, the memory of the princess's grandmother lingered in the minds of those who knew her.|"[""1.

Curdie found it hard to believe in things he couldn't see. His father, a man of many thoughts, would doubt his own eyes before questioning his wife's words. The miners were good, bad, or in-between, but they knew little about the world above. Curdie liked them but couldn't talk to them about his doubts. Growing up, he focused more on mining and less on the beauty of nature. He became less curious and more skeptical, believing only in what he could see. Curdie's parents were concerned about his lack of wonder and imagination. One day, Curdie shot a white pigeon, feeling proud until he saw its pain. As he held the wounded bird, he felt a pang of regret, realizing the consequences of his actions.|"[""1.

As Curdie held the lifeless pigeon, his heart swelled with a mix of confusion and sorrow. The pigeon's eyes, fixed on him, made him realize the gravity of his actions. It wasn't just a bird; it was a symbol of something greater. The realization hit him hard - he had strayed from his purpose. Tears welled up as he remembered a white pigeon that had once brought a sense of peace. Now, the world seemed to turn against him, the very elements expressing disapproval. As darkness fell, a rock's rumble startled him, and he mistook a goat and a dog for goblins. In that moment, holding the dead pigeon, Curdie grappled with the weight of his actions, questioning his place in the world.|"['1.

As darkness enveloped the surroundings, a troubling feeling crept into Curdie's heart. He scolded himself for his foolishness, feeling a surge of anger. Just as he was about to discard the bird and whistle away his frustration, a radiant light bathed the area. Looking up, Curdie beheld a brilliant sphere of light, reminiscent of molten silver. The light emanated from above the castle's roofs, resembling the moon of the elderly princess. Despite his disbelief in her presence, the luminous globe and the motion of the supposedly lifeless bird in his grasp puzzled Curdie. Startled by the bird's sudden movement, he sprinted towards the castle, avoiding jostling the injured creature. Upon reaching the castle, he found the front door wide open, a welcome sight that spared him the need to knock. Determined to ascend, Curdie spotted the grand staircase ahead, guiding his path within the mysterious castle.|"[""1.

Curdie closed his eyes, forming a mental image of the tower's exterior. Stepping into this mental image, he retraced each stair's path, keeping the tower's layout in mind. Reaching the top, he memorized the direction. Ascending another stair, he repeated the process. At the final stair, he couldn't proceed and retraced his steps to locate the tower's interior stairs. Despite the darkness, he navigated towards the tower. Following a dim passage, he glimpsed the fading sunset. Focused on his quest, Curdie continued eastward, finding a door at the end of a passage. Knocking, he heard a spinning wheel's hum. Mesmerized, he entered, drawn by the enchanting sound, until remembering the bird. Startled, he knocked, and the door creaked open, revealing a moonlit room.|"[""1.

"""There are more moons than you know of, Curdie. Where there is one sun there are many moons--and of many sorts. Come in and look out of my window, and you will soon satisfy yourself that there is a moon looking in at it."" All the time the sound of the spinning had been going on and on, and Curdie now caught sight of the wheel. Oh, it was such a thin, delicate thing--reminding him of a spider's web in a hedge. It stood in the middle of the moonlight, and it seemed as if the moonlight had nearly melted it away. A step nearer, he saw, with a start, two little hands at work with it. And then at last, in the shadow on the other side of the moonlight which came like silver between, he saw the form to which the hands belonged: a small withered creature, so old that no age would have seemed too great to write under her picture, seated on a stool beyond the spinning wheel, which looked very large beside her, but, as I said, very thin, like a long-legged spider holding up its own web, which was the round wheel itself She sat crumpled together, a filmy thing that it seemed a puff would blow away, more like the body of a fly the big spider had sucked empty and left hanging in his web, than anything else I can think of.

As she spoke, she extended her hand to him. When he grasped it, she used his help to rise from her stool. Suddenly, before Curdie's eyes, she transformed into a tall, powerful woman, visibly aged yet dignified and somewhat stern. All signs of frailty vanished as she stood before him, her hair white but abundant, gleaming like silver under the moonlight. Straight and strong, she faced the amazed boy, the injured bird now resting on her chest like a mystical ornament. Curdie took a few steps towards the door, intending to ask her name, but she disappeared. In the darkness, fear gripped him, and he made his way down the stairs, feeling lost. Eventually, he found himself outside under the starlit sky, relieved to be free. As he journeyed home, a sense of peace filled him, grateful for the release from the bird's blood. Upon returning, his parents noticed a change in him and sensed he had a tale to tell. Curdie waited until they sat by the brook under the night sky, feeling the time was right to share his extraordinary encounter.|"[""1.

"There, next to the flowing water, as it rushed down towards the valley and the sea, chattering about a thousand genuine things it couldn't grasp, Curdie recounted his tale to his parents, both outside and inside. A whole new world had slipped between the mine's entrance and his mother's cottage! Not a word was spoken until he finished. ""It seems so to me,"" Peter replied with a hidden smile, understood by his wife through his words' tone. They were the happiest couple in the land because they always comprehended each other, meaning the same fair, true, and right things, loving those more than anything else. ""It doesn't matter much,"" his mother said. ""If you understand something, you'll soon know what to think of it. Surely, Curdie, you know what to do with this?"" His mother reminded him of the time he saw the old princess in the tower, which he had dismissed as just an old tub, straw, an apple, and a sunbeam. Curdie recalled meeting the princess, a tall, ethereal being, appearing stronger than his mother. His mother pointed out how reality can be just as wondrous as dreams, referencing the transformation of a tiny seed into a beautiful plant. She encouraged Curdie to dream, as dreams might hold more truth than waking thoughts.

Once upon a time, there was a mysterious old woman who lived near a well. People whispered that she was a witch who did wicked things. Some claimed she had a long forefinger that could make people sick if she stirred the well with it. Others believed she could transform into a beautiful angelic young woman who blinded any man who looked at her. Despite these scary stories, a few believed she might be misunderstood. Peter questioned why they only believed bad things about her when there could be good in her too. The villagers dismissed his thoughts, convinced of her evil nature.

Curdie, a brave young man, refused to be afraid of anything bad. He believed that even when people speak ill, there might be good hidden within. As he worked in the mines with his father, a mysterious light caught their attention. They followed it through the passages, discovering hidden paths. Eventually, the light transformed into a beautiful lady with golden hair and emerald attire. Curdie recognized her as the old princess, Irene's great-great-grandmother.

In a grand cavern, Curdie and his companion found themselves surrounded by a dazzling display of colorful stones emitting radiant light. The stones sparkled in hues of the rainbow and more, creating a mesmerizing spectacle. Amidst this beauty stood an ancient lady, the epitome of harmony and loveliness. As she departed, the brilliance of the cavern waned, leaving only the dim glow of their lamps. Anxious about finding their way back in the dark, they waited, their lamps flickering. Despite growing weariness, they clung to the vision of the Lady of Light, strengthening each other's resolve.

"As they spotted a distant figure, they stood up in respect. Approaching closer, they bowed, then gazed at the elderly yet youthful woman with admiration. Addressing Peter, she revealed, ""I am both poor and rich, working for my bread with no special treatment. Being poor has its advantages, allowing things that riches may hinder."" She disclosed a hidden royal lineage within Peter's family, grooming Curdie for a significant task. Despite initial doubts, Curdie's repentance was noted.

The following night, Curdie left the mine a bit early to freshen up before heading to the dove tower. The princess hadn't set a specific time, so he aimed to arrive around the same time as before.

As Curdie watched the setting sun, a peculiar sight caught his eye. Against the red, hazy sun, a mysterious creature appeared, seeming to emerge from the sun's fiery heart.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the creature, revealed to be Lina, the fearsome creature from the princess's, approached him but then lay down beside him. Despite her terrifying appearance, Curdie extended his hand to her.

As Curdie watched, one of the creatures lagged behind and then veered off into the woods, moving in a strange, undulating manner. After a wild gallop, it rejoined the group peacefully.

Curdie climbed the winding road to the city, where curious onlookers stared unfriendly. Despite the stares, no one bothered them. Upon reaching the city gate, they entered a steep street leading to the palace towering above. A baker, rushing to a friend's shop, tripped and hurt his head. He cursed the stone on the street, blaming the king for not maintaining the roads. Curdie, instead of replying, smashed the stone with his mattock.

The baker's wife observed everything that had happened since her husband left the shop and took a liking to Curdie. She was more honest than her husband and offered Curdie a loaf of their own bread, warning him about the unfriendliness towards strangers in the area. Curdie and Lina, his dog, continued up the street to a bustling market surrounded by butcher shops where aggressive dogs attacked Lina. Curdie defended himself and Lina, killing the attacking dogs.

We are both under the rule of the king, and my poor animal can't help her appearance. Imagine being treated poorly just because you were not considered attractive? She's not any happier about her looks than you are—she just can't change them. A crowd gathered behind the butchers, including boys from school who started throwing stones at the strangers. One stone hit Lina, but she crushed it with her teeth, scaring the crowd. The people ran away, calling them the devil and his dam. Curdie and Lina were left alone in the market. Everyone closed their doors in fear. Curdie knocked on an inn's door, but they threw things at him. Lina almost attacked, but Curdie stopped her. A young child came out of a house and led Curdie inside. The child rode Lina, and they were welcomed by the grandmother, who was not afraid of them like the others in the city.|"['1.

"When Curdie closed the door behind him, the other doors opened, and people cautiously gathered in groups around the threshold. Some even dared to step out onto the square, but quickly retreated at the slightest movement from the thatched house.

Curdie pondered over a stone he tripped on thrice in the past month, suspecting foul play. Testing the hammer that broke the stone, he nearly injured himself. Meanwhile, the wanderers found warmth and hospitality with an old woman and her grandchild. Curdie shared tales of his mine adventures and family, omitting the unbelievable parts about the king and princess.

As Curdie protected the house from unseen threats at night, Lina, the dog, alerted him. The next morning, the authorities demanded Curdie and Lina surrender themselves for causing trouble and harming citizens' animals. Despite the unjust accusations, Curdie remained confident in Lina's ability to protect herself and promised to make amends for any damage caused."|['1.

A woman held a little girl close, ready for anything, as chaos erupted. The city marshal shouted, but Curdie ignored him. When they heard his mattock, the crowd panicked. Lina, a fearsome creature, terrified the soldiers and the crowd as she vanished. Curdie surrendered, and the soldiers, ashamed, tied him up. They led him to a dark building where the magistrate was busy with breakfast. Curdie, in the dark, freed himself and waited. He thought of his family, finding solace. As the crowd gathered outside, Curdie freed himself and awaited his fate. The magistrate, oblivious, finally called for Curdie's trial.

Curdie sat in the dimly lit vault, pondering the mystery of the King mentioned by the city marshal. Suddenly, a scream pierced the air, followed by chaos as people fled in terror. Lina, the fierce creature with yellow eyes, rushed in and sought refuge at Curdie's feet. Soldiers locked them in the vault, leaving them in darkness. With a flicker of light from his candle, Curdie surveyed the dirty, neglected space. Determined to escape, he worked tirelessly to break through the floor, revealing a hidden cave below. The dim light and the sound of water offered hope for a way out, but the dangerous drop posed a challenge. Curdie and Lina faced the daunting task of enlarging the hole to reach potential freedom.|"['1.

Curdie needed to explore. He secured a rope to his pickaxe, creating a support for himself as he descended into a cave. The rope was short, and he worried about falling into water. Spotting an opening, he swung across to it and found a passage. He returned for his companion, Lina, and tools. Together, they navigated through the cave, reaching a door. Curdie managed to open it with Lina's help, revealing a space with a wine cask.|"['1.

Curdie was about to explore the area when he heard footsteps approaching. Uncertain if the door would open near him or far away, it did neither. A man with a candle and a silver flagon appeared, heading his way. The light revealed wine casks stretching into darkness. Curdie hid by the stairs, watching the man pour something from the flagon into a cask. After a series of actions, the man drank from a cask and left the door open as he fled. Curdie followed, locking the door, and listened to the commotion inside. The man was accused of a drunken episode, and the missing key fueled suspicions. The cellar goblin rumor surfaced, and the wine cellar remained unlocked, much to everyone's delight.|"['1.

Curdie and Lina found themselves in the wine cellar of the palace after the soldiers and the magistrate had left. Lina, hungry and thirsty, drank from a pool of wine, while Curdie eyed the tempting supper in the stone hall. Determined to secure some food, Curdie spotted a pie and decided to seize it when the hall was empty. When the moment came, he swiftly grabbed the pie and returned to the cellar with Lina. They devoured the pie, hiding the dish afterward. Curdie, vigilant, waited for the house to quiet down, ready for any task that awaited him. Eventually, he shouldered his mattock and headed towards the servants' hall, taking Lina with him, as they continued their secret mission.|"['1.

When Curdie and Lina reached the hall, it was quiet and dimly lit. The remnants of a once-great fire cast a faint red glow, but provided little light. Feeling the chill of the cellar, Curdie stood by the dying fire to warm himself briefly. He noticed several candlesticks on the supper table but found that all the candles had been left to burn out, some still hot at the neck. As he searched for bits of candle, he discovered seven men asleep in various places, seemingly in a deep slumber from excessive eating and drinking. Curdie even found unusual items like ox hoofs, pig hoofs, and a dog's paw among them. Disgusted by the state of the palace, Curdie continued his search for candles, eventually finding a few pieces. They then left the hall and entered a dark, smoky kitchen, illuminated by a dwindling fire, revealing the chaotic and dirty surroundings. The scene saddened Curdie, thinking about the princess living in such unpleasant conditions. He moved on to the sculleries, where he encountered more filth and disorder, with mangy dogs and rats scavenging around. The foul smells and sights made him long for his mother's clean kitchen. Finally, they proceeded to a grand corridor with sleeping men in royal attire, giving off an air of foolishness. Lina seemed ready to pounce on them. They ascended a staircase, leaving behind the squalor of the lower quarters.|['1.

Curdie explored a rich yet soft environment, with ancient fortress remnants scattered about. As he and Lina, his companion, wandered, they found themselves repeatedly in familiar spots. Gradually, Curdie began to grasp the layout. Lina grew increasingly fearful, hinting at the presence of someone nearby. Approaching a crimson-curtained gallery with a royal crown, Curdie sensed he was nearing the king's chamber. Upon lifting the curtain, he found a half-open door, leading to a dimly lit room with a grand bed. As he cautiously advanced, a figure emerged, resembling a taller version of the princess who had sent him. The princess signaled for silence and approached Curdie. He recognized her noble demeanor and addressed her as his princess, revealing his mission from her ancestor. The princess gestured for him to be quiet, hinting at a mysterious situation in the king's chamber.|"[""1.

The old king lay on his bed with his crown between his hands, asleep. A young maiden and a miner stood by his side. Lina, unseen by all, spoke softly, leading the miner to the middle of the room. She explained how the doctor gave the king wine to keep him alive. The princess praised the doctor's kindness and care for the king. The princess shared that the land mourned the king's illness for a year. Curdie, surprised by the news, realized the lack of love and concern shown to the king. Irene revealed she stayed awake at night to be with her father. She shared how the search for Curdie led to fears of goblins and sorrow for his family.

As he talked, his eyes spotted something shiny on the table under the light. His heart raced, and he approached it. It was the same container the butler had filled in the wine cellar. The princess exclaimed, 'Oh, dear Dr. Kelman!' and tried to move him but failed. Curdie helped him up, only to find out it was not his foot but a creeping thing. He quickly cleaned the container, filled it with wine, and took it back to the king's room. The doctor poured the wine down the king's throat, and Curdie realized there was a plot against the king. He understood he needed the princess on his side to work together and save the king from the treachery within the palace. They had to ensure the king consumed nothing prepared in the palace to protect him from harm. Curdie was determined to thwart the traitors' plans and safeguard the king's life.|"['1.

As Curdie pondered, the princess watched her father with love and tenderness. She fanned him gently with peacock feathers, whispering in his ear to calm his troubled dreams. Curdie, understanding the king's condition, shared his concerns with the princess. He warned her about the dishonesty and disrespect in the palace, urging her to be cautious. Curdie decided to get the king honest food to aid his recovery, while also protecting the princess from potential harm. The princess informed Curdie about the chancellor and the king's horse master having supper in a room off the great hall.

The princess entered the room quietly, her head bowed down, and her tail trailing behind her. Curdie observed her as she approached, sending a shiver down his spine. When she got closer, Lina, the frightening creature, dropped to the floor and covered her face with her paws. The princess was moved and knelt beside Lina, comforting her with gentle strokes and pats. Curdie then set off to find some bread for the princess, promising to return later. He ensured the princess was safe and convinced her to rest until he called her.

Curdie had to deliver the loaf to the princess. He decided to send Lina if he couldn't do it himself. As he approached the servants' hall, he heard them stirring. One wanted to go to bed, another to the cellar for wine, and a third challenged a fourth to a game. Seeing the risk of passing through, Curdie returned to the cellar. He tied the loaf in Irene's handkerchief around Lina's neck and instructed her to take it to the princess. Irene was relieved to see Lina bring the bundle, assuring her of Curdie's safety. Lina left silently. Irene shared the bread and wine with her father, the king, who felt better and fell asleep. Meanwhile, Curdie found a warm spot in the cellar with Lina watching over him.

The king, feeling more like himself, wanted to understand a paper before signing it. When the chamberlain struggled to read, the princess stepped in. The chamberlain tried to dissuade her, but the king insisted. As the princess read, the king's suspicion grew about the chamberlain. The king decided he wasn't well enough for such important matters. The chamberlain tried to get the king to sign, but the king refused. The princess was happy to see her father's improvement. The doctor was called, promising the king would comply the next day. The princess read stories to her father, who listened attentively. With each meal and rest, the king felt better.

In the meantime, Curdie and Lina took turns watching and sleeping, ensuring they both got enough rest. During the afternoon, they observed some servants sneaking into the cellar, drinking wine, and leaving in a hurry. Their focus was on protecting the king, not the wine theft. They also noticed the butler, looking terrified, bringing a candle and a small dog. The dog wandered close to them, but Lina scared him off without a sound. When supper neared, Curdie waited by the servants' hall door, hoping to secure food for the king and princess. He managed to grab a loaf and a pie, but they were soon discovered missing. The blame shifted to the pages, and a search ensued. Curdie, overhearing the commotion, devised a plan to rid the palace of the treacherous staff. He discovered a rock with gold particles, envisioning a prosperous future for the king.|"['1.

It brought Curdie great joy to wield his mattock once more. Time flew by swiftly, and as he made his way to the king's chamber, a pile of debris had already accumulated behind the shattered door. With cautious steps, Curdie entered the hall accompanied by Lina. He found a girl weeping by the fading fire, the same one who had witnessed him taking food and had been treated harshly for speaking the truth. The girl lamented the difficulty of being disbelieved when telling the truth, as honesty was a rare virtue in the palace. Curdie assured her of his intention to set things right by confronting the servants about their wrongdoings. Upon reaching the king's chamber, he discovered the monarch awake and distressed. The king confided in Curdie about his sorrow over the wickedness prevailing in his kingdom, worsened by the loss of his queen. He shared his concerns about the decay of truth and morality among his people, leading to unrest and discontent. The king's illness stemmed from his despair over the moral decline of his subjects, causing him sleepless nights and distressing dreams. He also expressed suspicions towards those around him, feeling isolated and betrayed. The king revealed his fears of being poisoned by an evil doctor disguised as a physician. Curdie, after uncovering the truth about the doctor's treachery, assured the king of his loyalty and readiness to confront his enemies.|"[""1.

The king smiled contentedly, drifted off to sleep, and Curdie convinced the princess to rest as well. Curdie then sought help from the housemaid to locate the council members' rooms in the palace. After being shown the rooms, he positioned himself behind a curtain in the king's chamber, instructing Lina to hide under the bed quietly. Around one in the morning, the doctor sneaked in, unaware of Lina's presence. The doctor, with ill intent, prepared a drink for the king. Curdie noticed a snake-like look on the doctor's face and, with Lina's help, thwarted the doctor's harmful plans. The doctor was subdued, and the lord chamberlain emerged in a state of fright. Curdie's quick thinking prevented further harm, leaving the king safe and secure in his chamber.|"['1.

Curdie reassured Irene that the creature in the room was not old. He led Irene to witness Lina, a large creature, asleep with a crown between her paws. Curdie explained that Lina was kind but could be fierce if provoked. Curdie then fed Lina and took her to work in the castle, ensuring she was satisfied. Lina was released from the dungeon and swiftly left the castle. The next morning, the staff noticed a change in the chambermaid's demeanor. The butler and other staff members were puzzled by her behavior.

As she spoke, she approached the housemaid and without waiting for a response, struck her on the ear, causing chaos around her. The servants began to shove, pinch, and punch the housemaid aggressively. They forced her out of the hall with violence, down the stairs to the wine cellar, locking her inside. Meanwhile, the king and princess, neglected by the servants, finished their meal. Curdie engaged the king in conversation to distract him. Curdie recounted his life, experiences with goblins, and finding the princess. Irene then shared her side of the story, and they continued weaving their tales together, captivating the king. As the night approached, Curdie grew anxious about potential threats. When darkness fell, the princess expressed her fear of the stillness. Curdie decided to check on Lina and secure the doors before venturing out. Upon reaching the cellar door, he discovered it locked, and as he attempted to open it, someone grabbed his arm.|['1.

Quickly, Curdie climbed into the dungeon where Lina had helped him. The place was filled with strange creatures, more bizarre than in any nightmare. Lina, with her green eyes, was waiting for Curdie near the hole. As Curdie started enlarging the hole to get the creatures into the cellar, a tapir-like creature with a strong proboscis and a club-headed creature helped clear the way. They all hesitated to go down the hole until a serpent-like creature bridged the gap by holding onto a bar of iron with its teeth, allowing Curdie to slide down safely. The creatures followed suit, using the serpent's body as a bridge. Curdie realized these creatures must have been miners due to their hardness. He marveled at the legserpent's clever solution to help them cross.|['1.

Curdie bravely rescued Ballbody, a peculiar round creature with eyes and a mouth, who rolled to safety but couldn't cross the bridge. Curdie carried Ballbody and safely reached a dim room with a sleeping elderly man, whose hand he gratefully touched. Later, Curdie confronted the butler, exposing his villainy and the palace's disorder. The staff initially stood in shock, then a footman mocked Curdie, but Curdie's swift action humbled the footman. Despite being seen as just a miner boy, Curdie's courage and honesty made an impact on the palace staff.|"[""**1.

Curdie found himself surrounded by his peers, who reacted with chaos upon him. Some summoned the dogs, while others cursed and the women screamed. The footmen and pages encircled him, but Curdie managed to keep them at bay by brandishing his mattock threateningly. Accusations flew, calling him a thief and a hypocrite. Just as the situation escalated with the butler and the cook armed with hot poker and spit, Curdie's loyal companion, Lina, burst into the room. With a mighty roar, she subdued the butler, allowing Curdie to disarm the cook. The creatures, following Curdie's lead, lined up along the wall, ready for orders. Curdie instructed two creatures to block the doors, causing panic among the culprits.

The men, initially scared, were followed and pushed by the creatures but soon grew bold. A tapir twisted a man's finger, and chaos ensued. The avengers tormented them until they fled to the kitchen.

The secretary was startled when Lina, the legserpent, appeared in the room. Frozen with fear, he tried to approach her, but she growled menacingly, causing him to faint in terror. Meanwhile, the lord chamberlain was ensnared by the legserpent, coiling around him and his bed, creating a silver cage. The tapir, assigned to the soldier, pecked at him until he retreated to bed.

The essence of their faith, he explained, was that those who follow it always prosper. The core belief was simple: care for oneself first. This was humanity's primary duty. If everyone followed this principle, all would be well—one person always equaled one. Yet, care exceeded necessity, and the surplus should be shared with neighbors, creating a cycle of care and comfort. Kindness and justice built the safest haven, ensuring personal bliss. The law, as stated in the proverb, was crucial, evident in the swift retribution against those who strayed from honesty. As the sermon continued, a serpent-like creature emerged, seizing the preacher. Panic ensued, and the city prepared for a grand exorcism to rid the palace of demons. Plans for reform and revolt took shape, with the citizens ready to take arms. After expelling the demons, the leaders strategized an assault on the palace.|['1.

That night, unsettling events led to the abandonment of their plans. Reports of terrifying creatures roaming the streets spread fear among the community. Strange occurrences included a citizen being dragged into the river and a thief's shop ransacked. The city marshal's statue was damaged, and the magistrate was pranked with a bath of turtle soup.

Despair gripped him as he hurried down with heavy steps. The housekeeper, like a frightening spider, and her men chased after him, but Peter ignored them, driven by the princess's mockery.
