"""No, sir, Mr. Swift, excuse me, but you made a small error. I never had any liverage on this wagon. It's not that kind of wagon. I once drove a livery rig, but that was some years ago. I haven't worked for the livery stable in some time now. That's why I know there's no livery on this wagon. You'll excuse me, but you are slightly mistaken.""

""Alright,"" replied Tom with a chuckle, not bothering to explain what he meant by the lever force of the brake rod. ""Let's leave it at that. Livery or no livery, your brake will work now. I think you're all set. Now, don't forget to come around and do some whitewashing,"" and after ensuring that the colored man could climb onto the seat and start off Boomerang, who seemed reluctant to move, Tom rode his motor-cycle back to the road.

""This machine has more potential than I thought,"" pondered Tom. ""But one thing I need to change is the gasolene and spark controls. I'm not satisfied with them the way they are. I need better leverage, just like Eradicate needed on his wagon. I'll fix them when I get home.""

Tom sought his father's approval to assign Eradicate the task of cleaning a chicken house and whitewashing it. Eradicate promptly started working on the task. Later, Tom noticed Eradicate struggling with the thick whitewash running down the brush handle. Recalling a rubber device he had seen on a window-cleaning brush, Tom decided to help Eradicate. He fitted a small rubber disk over the brush handle to prevent the whitewash from dripping. Eradicate was amazed by the improvement and thanked Tom for the clever solution. Tom then discussed his plans to protect his turbine motor by sending it to Albany with a lawyer to secure a complete patent without drawing attention in Washington.

The young inventor was at a crossroads, unsure of his next move. Going back home would delay his trip to Albany, while continuing to Pompville might provide the wire he needed. Opting to head to Pompville, he trudged through the sand, each step feeling heavier than the last. Suddenly, a gunshot rang out from the nearby woods, startling him. He feared it was the tramp from whom he was trying to retrieve the wire. However, it turned out to be a hunter named Theodore Duncan testing his new gun.

Tom quickly fixed the wire on his motor-cycle using spare materials. He tested the spark and found it worked almost as well as the original. Carrying extra supplies, he rode to Pompville for a replacement copper wire. After a quick adjustment, he continued towards Centreford. While approaching the city, a car pulled up behind him.

Tom spotted an open car with three men seeking shelter from the rain under some blankets. As Tom was about to call out to them, one of the men noticed a shed nearby. The man instructed the driver to steer towards the shed, but when the other men saw Tom, the driver abruptly turned the car back onto the road. Tom puzzled over the strange turn of events as the rain poured down. He sought refuge in the shed, contemplating his journey to Fordham and then Albany.

Tom, the young inventor, was deep in thought, planning his next move, unaware of his surroundings. Unseen by him, a figure crept closer through the grass, while an automobile with rain-soaked men inside watched closely. As the storm cleared and the sun peeked through the clouds, Tom stretched, feeling tired. Suddenly, a club struck him from behind, rendering him unconscious. The men, Featherton and Morse, quickly decided to take Tom and his invention to a secluded spot. They hurried to load Tom onto the auto while Morse carried the valuable model.

"Tom retrieved his tools from his bag on the motorcycle. He unlocked the treadmill, allowing the platform for the animal to walk on to rotate. As soon as he did this, Boomerang sensed the movement and began to walk, causing the treadmill to spin. Eradicate, watching in amazement, exclaimed joyfully, ""It's working! But the saw isn't moving, Mr. Swift."" Tom reassured him and explained how to engage the saw. He demonstrated how to start and stop the mule's movement and how to operate the sawmill. Eradicate lamented his struggles to find help, mentioning that even when he asked others, they preferred different tasks. Tom encouraged him to keep trying and showed him the ropes.

Eradicate paused from his work and shared about a peculiar tramp he had encountered. The tramp had unworked hands and a strange blue ring embedded in his skin, reminiscent of a man at the circus. Eradicate suggested the tramp might be heading to the old mansion where General Harkness once lived. Tom, intrigued by this information, planned to investigate the mansion in pursuit of Happy Harry and the thieves who had robbed him. Tom expressed gratitude to Eradicate for the valuable clue. Excited, Tom rushed home to share the news with his father, Mr. Swift. Despite Mr. Swift's caution about common tramp characteristics, Tom was convinced the mansion was the thieves' hideout, eager to unravel the mystery the next day.|"['1.

Mr. Swift smiled as Tom cleverly shifted the conversation. He acknowledged the possibility of tramps in the area but doubted they were the culprits behind the theft of his model and patent papers, considering the thieves were likely wealthy. Tom, determined to recover the stolen items, decided on a cautious approach to avoid alerting the suspects. Planning to approach the mansion discreetly through the woods, he faced delays on his journey due to a flat tire and battery issues. Nightfall found him near a charcoal-burner's shanty, where he arranged to stay the night.

The charcoal-burner suggested following the old wood road to reach the lake near the old mansion. Tom, the young inventor, cautiously approached the lake, hiding his motor-cycle in bushes. As he surveyed the area, he spotted a dilapidated mansion and a motor-boat with a man approaching. Tom realized the man was likely involved in the robbery he was investigating. He decided to observe discreetly, knowing the importance of not alerting the criminals. Tom strategized on how to uncover the gang's hideout and retrieve his father's belongings.

Tom carefully planned his approach to the old mansion, knowing the desperate men he was up against. He decided to avoid the lake shore, fearing detection by a motorboat. Instead, he chose to navigate through the woods, recalling his father's belief in having a systematic plan. As he cautiously made his way forward, he relied on his hunting skills to move quietly. After a while, he caught sight of the mansion in ruins within an overgrown park. Just as he was about to sneak closer, he spotted one of the men from the automobile. Tom hid in the bushes, heart pounding, as the man circled the grounds. After the man left, Tom waited before cautiously resuming his approach, aware of the danger lurking around the corner.|"['1.

Tom thought he had to wait until night to sneak up and look into the mansion without being seen by the guard. Despite hunger, he knew he had to do it. He stayed hidden in the bushes, observing the guard's movements. As darkness fell, Tom saw a light in the mansion. He cautiously approached the window, standing on a stone to peer inside. He saw the three men from the car examining the stolen model and papers. Tom realized he had found the thieves' hideout.|"[""1.

Tom observed as one of the men retrieved a box from under the table, placing the model inside. Papers followed, and a cover was secured with nails. The men then huddled, gesturing where to hide the box. One pointed to the lake, another to the forest. Tom, trying to eavesdrop, accidentally made a noise, causing the men to turn towards him. Tom quickly ducked out of sight and fled into the woods. Bruised from crashing into a tree, he stumbled onto a cow path. As his eyes adjusted, he cautiously navigated through the darkness, listening to the woods' sounds. Realizing he was not yet safe, Tom pondered his next move, feeling outnumbered and in need of assistance.|['1.

Tom decided to head down to the lake shore to keep watch. He planned to prevent the men from escaping in the boat by making a loud commotion if they tried. As he navigated through the woods to reach the lake, he encountered some challenges with the dense bushes but eventually made it to the shore near the abandoned house where the men were. Tom considered setting the motorboat adrift to block their escape route but then realized it was a valuable boat and decided to use it as a shelter for the night instead. He intended to stay until morning and then seek help to recover his father's model.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat was Tom's initial plan when he decided to head down to the lake shore?\nA) To set the motorboat adrift\nB) To seek help to recover his father's model\nC) To make a loud commotion to prevent the men from escaping\nD) To use the boat as a shelter for the night\nE) To navigate through the dense bushes"", 'Question 2:\nWhat challenges did Tom encounter as he navigated through the woods to reach the lake shore?\nA) Challenges with the dense bushes\nB) Challenges with the abandoned house\nC) Challenges with the motorboat\nD) Challenges with seeking help\nE) Challenges with the men', ""Question 3:\nWhy did Tom decide not to set the motorboat adrift?\nA) It was a valuable boat\nB) It was broken\nC) It was too heavy\nD) It was his father's model\nE) It was blocking his way"", ""Question 4:\nWhat did Tom plan to do after using the boat as a shelter for the night?\nA) Stay in the woods\nB) Seek help immediately\nC) Set the boat adrift\nD) Prevent the men from escaping\nE) Recover his father's model"", ""Question 5:\nWhat was Tom's intention in staying at the lake shore until morning?\nA) To escape the men\nB) To seek help\nC) To recover his father's model\nD) To prevent the men from escaping\nE) To block the escape route"", ""Question 6:\nWhat did Tom ultimately decide to use the motorboat for?\nA) To escape\nB) To set it adrift\nC) To seek help\nD) To block the men's escape route\nE) To use it as a shelter for the night""]"|"['C) To make a loud commotion to prevent the men from escaping', 'A) Challenges with the dense bushes', 'A) It was a valuable boat', ""E) Recover his father's model"", ""C) To recover his father's model"", 'E) To use it as a shelter for the night']"
That afternoon, Tom discovered a hidden spot by the shore with bushes for cover. He steered the boat there, out of sight, and settled in for the night. Despite the cushioned seats, Tom had an uncomfortable night. He dozed fitfully, waking up, fearing the men at the mansion were escaping. Morning seemed distant, but as the stars faded, Tom decided to return to his motorbike for help. He planned to ask the charcoal-burner to assist while he guarded the boat. Reluctantly, Tom left the boat, wishing he had brought help as his dad suggested. He trekked back to his motorbike undisturbed, passing the mansion where all seemed quiet. Anxious that the model might be taken, Tom hurried to the charcoal-burner's cabin, but the old man was absent. Unable to seek help, Tom resolved to ride for aid himself.|"['1.

Tom found the kitchen tools, prepared coffee, and cooked bacon and eggs. Feeling refreshed, he left money on the table to pay for the food. Looking out the window, he saw no one but the hungry bulldog that had arrived alone. Tom spotted leftover chicken bones, called the dog, and tossed bones to lure it into a shed. Seizing the opportunity, Tom dashed to his motorbike. As he revved the engine, the dog barked. Tom sped away, leaving the cottage and the dog behind. Determined to reach the nearest village quickly, Tom raced on the rough road, fearing the men might escape. Suddenly, a car horn startled him, but he pressed on, unsure of what lay ahead.|"['1.
