The rain splashed on the rocks, with wind howling through the trees. The girls huddled for shelter, trying to make sense of each other's voices.

The wide lake narrowed into a stream, meandering from the mountain springs. Thick willows concealed the banks as girls rowed determinedly. Jennie, curious about a figure in white with braids, learned it was Mary, a friend approved by Aunt Audrey. Cleo, noticing a watcher, reassured Jennie and invited Mary to join them in the boat. Mary, anxious about Janos and Reda, feared for her safety. Cleo suggested taking Mary to the landing, then home with Jennie.

"All the hidden and suppressed hopes in that strangely veiled countenance seemed to burst through now, and Mary's expression, from one of almost impenetrable gloom, assumed a strange light--perhaps borrowed from the sunset. That settled it. Before Mary realized her position, she was sitting securely in the broad seat at the stern of the gliding boat, with Madaline's arm around her, while her delighted fingers trailed through the water, and her almost frightened gaze was fastened on Jennie's face. ""No, they all died with the fever, that is, Loved One did, and daddy was lost at sea.

""The idea of telling you you were sick, and scaring you into it,"" indignantly spoke Jennie, in whom an instant dislike for the sinister Reda had taken root.

"Arrangements were made so quickly that Mary was almost confused. A new marvel had entered the life of the shy girl – she was riding in a car. The power of true friends is truly magical! Despite their scout courage, the girls hesitated to meet two foreigners who might be upset. Meeting a kind old grandfather seemed more inviting. ""Turn here,"" Mary instructed the driver with authority, unusual for her. ""There's grandie,"" she announced. The man they approached was tall, stooped, and distinguished. As they reached the cottage hidden among chestnut trees, Mary called out to her grandfather. The atmosphere in the house was eerie, making everyone uneasy. Mary offered them a seat, but they declined, feeling the strange vibe. The shadows behind the stained glass door added to the mysterious aura, making Cleo wonder about the absence of another servant.

Cleo and Grace rushed to the door to call the driver, while Madaline, forgetting her fear, found a switch and pressed it. A sudden burst of blinding light filled the room.

Cleo urged Jennie to quickly get into the car so they could leave in a hurry. They all squeezed into the car, with Jennie and Professor Benson in the back seat. Tom, the driver, remained calm despite the chaos. Cleo reassured Jennie that Aunt Audrey would be grateful for their help. Mary decided to take her grandfather to a private sanitarium they had passed, and then return home with them. The group quickly got into the car, and Mary brought essential items for her grandfather. As they were about to drive off, Reda appeared, surprising everyone. The evening took a positive turn, lifting everyone's spirits. Professor Benson felt better, and Mary felt a newfound sense of freedom. The girls supported Mary, understanding the challenges she faced with her grandfather's belongings.

No error here. Even with Mary present, the children were eager to involve Mrs. Dunbar in their exciting secret, though it wasn't much of a secret with so many in the know. Upstairs, the girls welcomed Mary enthusiastically. Grace suggested a pale green dress to match her eyes, Madaline preferred baby blue, and Cleo offered a coral pink frock. Mary declined, insisting she must wear white to avoid getting sick like a past loved one. Cleo found the idea superstitious but complimented Mary on how lovely she looked in white. The girls agreed, and as they were called to dinner, Mary's fears seemed to fade. Cleo later discussed the evening, including the professor's narrow escape, with her aunt, seeking advice on how to help others as a Girl Scout.

Mary was captivated as she sat by the window, occasionally letting out a musical laugh only to stop abruptly, seemingly torn between joy and sadness. When Mrs. Dunbar appeared to announce bedtime and no news from a phone call, Cleo sensed disappointment. As they prepared for bed, the girls engaged in their usual playful activities like pillow fights and ghost dances. Drawing straws decided Mary's sleeping companion, Madaline, who was thrilled. As they settled in for the night, Mary, in her white nightdress, asked Madaline about a mysterious basket. With lights out, the girls drifted into dreams, their secrets safe. Meanwhile, Mrs. Dunbar, concerned about Professor Benson's restless sleep, ensured he received special attention at the sanitarium.

The girl quickly obeyed Cleo's instructions, descending the tree trunk with the ladder's help. All the girls, dressed in pajamas, gathered around. Grace wore an extra green sweater, Madaline donned Cleo's lavender cape, and Mary stood in white, while Cleo sported blue bird pajamas.

Cleo dashed back to the house to check if Auntie had finished her task. Meanwhile, Mary carefully relocated her pitcher plant to a safer spot, away from insects. She then gathered the basket and hurried back to the veranda with the others. They arrived just in time to see three men leaving, and Mrs. Dunbar's smile hinted that the meeting had gone well. One of the men, pleased with the outcome, handed Mrs. Dunbar a silk handkerchief with yellow borders, a clue to their investigation. Mrs. Dunbar recognized it as a foreign item, part of the organized plot they were uncovering. As the children approached, Mary shared the fascinating tale of the pitcher plant's breakfast habits. She offered the plant to Mrs. Dunbar, explaining its value and the interest it had sparked. Mrs. Dunbar gladly accepted the gift, promising that Mr. Dunbar would appreciate it too.

Mrs. Dunbar suggested that Mary would soon be able to assist the doctors as the issue seemed to be a memory blockage.

Mrs. Dunbar then had to leave to escort some delegates safely out of New York, leaving the girls to have a fun time. Grace proposed going to the village since they had some money left. Cleo mentioned her Scout Sacrifice for a child needing eye surgery, and Grace added that her father had contributed too.

Mary led her friends to Professor Benson's studio, a place filled with beautiful orchids.

The room was once a conservatory, cherished by the artist Imlay for cultivating rare plants. It was now the perfect place for Professor Benson's work. Orchids dangled in baskets, thriving without soil, almost floating in the air. Cleo assured Mary that she didn't need to share anything she wasn't comfortable with. Mary felt eager to reveal her story but showed her friends some exquisite orchids growing on a rubber tree. Time flew by, and Cleo realized they had spent two hours there. Worried about making Jennie anxious, they had to leave. Mary explained how her grandfather used wires for gentle heat and was working on a new electric system. Mary suspected some visitors had ill intentions towards her grandfather. Grace and Madaline hurried towards the door, leaving Cleo and Mary to finish watering the plants.

Mary smiled through misty eyes. All three scouts had tried to grab one of her arms, but Madaline settled for holding onto her long braids. Mary revealed she never wanted to know the people in a certain house due to a maid's unkind remark. Despite this, Mary had brought flowers for Mrs. Dunbar, but couldn't give them due to Grandie's rule against bringing flowers through the streets. The girls raced down the mountain road, then paused to search for four-leaf clovers. Unnoticed, two maids approached, but the girls were too engrossed in their task. Despite challenges, the girls managed tasks like caring for orchids and renting a studio. Mary was adjusting to her new surroundings and was set to visit her Grandie. Mrs. Dunbar complimented Mary's new outfit, and the girls left for Crow's Nest.|"[""1.

"""All aboard!"" exclaimed Cleo as she settled into her seat next to Tom. Unable to drive yet, she found joy in sitting beside the driver.
