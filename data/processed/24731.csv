"Grunty Pig was the smallest of seven siblings and initially was almost named ""Runty"" due to his size. However, his mother noticed his loud grunt and decided to change his name to ""Grunty"" instead. She believed that his loud voice could make up for his small size. Grunty Pig was solely focused on food and would have changed his name multiple times just for a sip of warm milk. Despite his siblings being larger, they often pushed him away from the feeding trough. Grunty Pig learned to position himself in the middle of the trough to ensure he got his share of food, even though he found it hard to breathe due to the crowding. While his siblings had poor manners at mealtime, Grunty Pig remembered his mother's lessons about eating politely."|"['1.

Mrs. Pig was upset by her unruly piglets' behavior during mealtime. They would push and jostle each other, leaving poor Grunty Pig without enough food. Despite Mrs. Pig's efforts to teach them manners, they continued to be greedy. Farmer Green noticed the chaos and decided to make a change. He created a feeding trough with holes for each piglet, ensuring everyone had a fair share. With this new system, the piglets learned to eat more politely and peacefully.

Grunty Pig kept his escape plans a secret, not sharing with his siblings. He was smaller but smarter, wanting to explore beyond the pigsty alone. Mrs. Pig didn't suspect his intentions as he searched for an exit. Finding a loose board, Grunty faced a challenge: he needed to make the opening larger. After days of effort, he succeeded in widening the gap and ventured out. Enjoying freedom, he feasted on fallen fruit but soon realized his limits, feeling uncomfortable from overeating.

There were more joys than just eating for Grunty Pig. He discovered a lane with delightful, sticky mud near the barn. Grunty happily wallowed in the mud, rolling around until every part of him was covered. Despite his messy appearance, he found the cool mud soothing on his pink skin. Henrietta Hen noticed Grunty's gurgles and grunts while she was hunting for worms. Surprisingly, no one realized Grunty was missing until feeding time. With a large family, it was easy for one piglet to slip away unnoticed. Farmer Green's clever lid with seven holes in the feeding trough revealed Grunty's escape through a loose board. Mrs. Pig's children each had a hole to stick their noses in during supper, creating a noisy mealtime that masked Grunty's absence. Farmer Green's discovery of the loose board revealed Grunty's escape route, showing that sometimes the smallest can be the smartest.|"['1.

When Mrs. Pig received the news, she gasped, nearly choking on her food. Grunty, her son, was missing! Regret washed over her, blaming herself for dozing off that afternoon. Worried, she urged Farmer Green not to leave her son out overnight, fearing for his safety. Farmer Green, understanding her concern, enlisted the help of Johnnie to search for Grunty. Meanwhile, Grunty, avoiding being caught by Henrietta Hen, ventured into a cornfield. Enjoying his freedom, he rooted around in the loose dirt until Mr. Crow startled him, demanding he leave the cornfield.

Mrs. Pig's family had a new rubbing post, a simple improvement that made a big difference. Grunty, the little pig, was the first to try it. His grumbling stopped, much to his mother's delight. Grunty became a little gentleman, using the post with manners. One day, Farmer Green gave them a treat, letting them out in a yard. Grunty, being curious, found a hole in the fence and squeezed through. Mrs. Pig warned him about bears nearby, but Grunty returned safely. Mrs. Pig scolded him for leaving without permission, but Grunty greeted her with a loud squeal, happy to be back.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat was the new addition to Mrs. Pig's family that made a big difference?\nA) A new feeding trough\nB) A new rubbing post\nC) A new water dispenser\nD) A new toy\nE) A new blanket"", 'Question 2:\nHow did Grunty react after using the rubbing post?\nA) He started grumbling more\nB) He became a little gentleman\nC) He refused to use it\nD) He ignored it\nE) He broke it', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Grunty find in the yard that caught his attention?\nA) A ball\nB) A hole in the fence\nC) A squirrel\nD) A bird\nE) A flower bed', 'Question 4:\nWhat did Mrs. Pig warn Grunty about when he found the hole in the fence?\nA) Foxes nearby\nB) Bears nearby\nC) Wolves nearby\nD) Snakes nearby\nE) Rabbits nearby', 'Question 5:\nHow did Grunty react when he returned to Mrs. Pig after going through the hole in the fence?\nA) He ignored her\nB) He scolded her\nC) He greeted her with a loud squeal\nD) He ran away\nE) He hid from her', 'Question 6:\nHow did Mrs. Pig react when Grunty returned after going through the hole in the fence?\nA) She scolded him\nB) She ignored him\nC) She praised him\nD) She gave him a treat\nE) She laughed at him']"|['B) A new rubbing post', 'B) He became a little gentleman', 'B) A hole in the fence', 'B) Bears nearby', 'C) He greeted her with a loud squeal', 'A) She scolded him']
The last time Farmer Green let Mrs. Pig's family out in the yard turned into a disaster for Mrs. Pig. Grunty, her son, ran off again, and soon she heard his loud squeals from a nearby field. Mrs. Pig realized he was getting closer by the second. Panicked, she gasped and panted, relieved he didn't catch her. After catching her breath, Mrs. Pig scolded Grunty, warning him never to stray again. She firmly instructed him to stay by her side, toppling him over to emphasize her point. Mrs. Pig made a strange noise, a mix of a squeal, grunt, gurgle, and gasp, before clumsily jumping on her son, showing him she meant business.|"[""1.

Mrs. Pig disciplined her mischievous son with a stern punishment, hoping to correct his habit of running away and telling lies. Despite his mother's efforts, the wayward pig slipped away when she took a nap, seeking adventure in the pasture. He enjoyed his freedom until realizing he had been gone longer than planned. Feeling brave, he decided to stay in the pasture forever, away from the looming punishment at home. However, as night fell, he began to feel homesick, hiding from Johnnie Green and Spot, who came to drive the cows home. As the cows passed, Grunty Pig followed from a distance, wary of bears and surprised to find the hole in the fence repaired, leaving him stranded outside the yard.|"[""1.

Jolly Robin was eager to find a solution to Grunty Pig's plan of uprooting the apple tree where they had their nest. Every day, Grunty Pig would dig at the tree's foot, threatening to topple it over.

Grunty Pig was proud of his curly tail and his siblings often teased him about it. Blackie, his brother, would mention tails before mealtime to delay Grunty from eating.

Grunty and Spot dashed in opposite directions and didn't meet for over a week. When they finally crossed paths, Spot avoided mentioning the prank he played. Meanwhile, near Farmer Green's house, a beech tree was a favorite spot for Johnnie Green, Frisky Squirrel, and Jasper Jay to enjoy beechnuts. Grunty Pig, new to the area, stumbled upon the tree and excitedly sniffed out the nuts. While Grunty happily feasted on the fallen beechnuts, Jasper Jay watched from above, skeptical of Grunty's intentions. As Grunty eagerly devoured the nuts, Jasper Jay doubted Grunty's promise not to eat unreachable nuts. Grunty remained silent, waiting for more nuts to drop from the tree.|"['1.

Grunty Pig remained calm despite Jasper Jay's insults. Even though he heard every word, he chose not to show any anger. He simply continued on his way, with Frisky Squirrel trailing behind. Once out of Jasper Jay's sight and hearing range, Frisky asked Grunty why he didn't react. Grunty explained that Jasper Jay only insulted him because he was safe up in a tree. Grunty even joked about uprooting the tree if not for his love of beechnuts. Moses Mouse then joined the conversation, revealing he lived in the farmhouse. Grunty envied the cat and dog who lived there, always having plenty to eat. Moses Mouse, however, shared that Mrs. Green, the farmhouse owner, kept a tidy home, leaving little food for the mice like him.|"[""Question 1:\nWhy did Grunty Pig choose not to react to Jasper Jay's insults?\nA) Because he couldn't hear Jasper Jay\nB) Because he was afraid of Jasper Jay\nC) Because he was safe up in a tree\nD) Because he wanted to make Jasper Jay angrier\nE) Because he wanted to impress Frisky Squirrel"", 'Question 2:\nWhat did Grunty Pig joke about doing to the tree where Jasper Jay was perched?\nA) Climbing it\nB) Uprooting it\nC) Decorating it\nD) Eating its leaves\nE) Building a nest on it', 'Question 3:\nWhy did Moses Mouse reveal that he lived in the farmhouse?\nA) To brag about his luxurious lifestyle\nB) To show off his large collection of food\nC) To make Grunty Pig and Frisky Squirrel jealous\nD) To explain why he envied the cat and dog\nE) To warn them about the dangers of the farmhouse', 'Question 4:\nWhat did Mrs. Green, the farmhouse owner, keep tidy according to Moses Mouse?\nA) The garden\nB) The barn\nC) The kitchen\nD) The pond\nE) The attic', 'Question 5:\nWhy did Grunty Pig envy the cat and dog who lived in the farmhouse?\nA) Because they were always fighting\nB) Because they were always hungry\nC) Because they were always sleeping\nD) Because they were always playing\nE) Because they always had plenty to eat', 'Question 6:\nWhat did Grunty Pig reveal about his love of beechnuts?\nA) He hated them\nB) He was allergic to them\nC) He was scared of them\nD) He was obsessed with them\nE) He was saving them for winter']"|['C) Because he was safe up in a tree', 'B) Uprooting it', 'D) To explain why he envied the cat and dog', 'C) The kitchen', 'E) Because they always had plenty to eat', 'D) He was obsessed with them']

Grunty Pig found himself in the farmhouse's parlor after exploring the dimly lit hall. He accidentally tipped over a table, causing a lamp to crash. Hearing the commotion, Farmer Green's wife appeared, startled at the sight of Grunty. Despite Grunty's attempts to blame Moses Mouse for the mishap, Mrs. Green laughed and ushered him out with a broom. Grunty never returned to the parlor, possibly due to Farmer Green securing his pen and the surrounding fence, or maybe because Grunty grew too plump to squeeze through any openings. Meanwhile, Racky, a creaky chair, disappeared after being sat on by Grandma, unintentionally taking her glasses and soothing a bunny to sleep.|['1.
