They finally reached the area near where they suspected the enemy was hidden. Following Tim's advice, they moved cautiously, dropping to their knees and crawling slowly to a grassy hill.

Amidst the noisy camp, the approach of the enemy went unnoticed until a sudden whoop alerted the chief. Dividing his forces, he lost some confidence, letting out a Rocky Mountain trapper's roar as he charged ahead. His men, attempting to mimic the roar, only added to the chaos. The Blackfoot chief, overwhelmed, retreated into the grass, leaving his men scattered. The captives, fearing the uncertain outcome, huddled around the missionary. Eventually, Whitewing's strict orders led to a non-lethal dispersal of the enemy. Later, the missionary baptized several Indians, including Whitewing and Lightheart, who were married shortly after. The trapper also sought marriage, uniting with Brighteyes. Whitewing embraced the Gospel, spreading its message with zeal across the prairies. Years later, events unfolded that brought these characters back into the limelight, with a log hut perched on a cliff becoming a focal point in their lives.|"['1.

The small fort's inside reflected its owner's character. A leather capote and leggings hung in one corner, buffalo robes in another.

"""Impossible,"" said Big Tim quickly; ""father must have been far away at that time, for Lopsuck Hill is a good three hours' walk from here as the crow flies, and the Blackfeet came from the opposite direction."" Without a word, Big Tim started to buckle on the cavalry sabre, not swinging it loosely as cavalry would, but securing it closely to his side. He then chose a short double-barrelled gun, slung a powder-horn and shot-pouch over his shoulders, and got ready to leave. ""Now listen,"" he said, finishing his preparations. ""I'm almost certain the cry you heard wasn't your dad's, but I must check.

Softswan, a skilled Indian girl, encountered a wounded white man in need of help. Despite his severe injury near the heart, she swiftly tended to his wound, using her expertise to stop the bleeding and bandage him. In the man's possession was a small Bible that had deflected the bullet, potentially saving his life.

The preacher sadly remarked that there was no escape, unable to venture down a path to save his life. Softswan, however, easily lifted a massive rock to reveal a hidden passage. As the Blackfeet renewed their assault, the preacher and Softswan disappeared into the hole. Meanwhile, Rushing River and his braves cautiously approached the fortress, led by the daring chief's courage. Rushing River bravely leaped over the breastwork and searched for defenders. Finding no one, he suspected an ambush and entered the hut, only to discover the defenders had fled through the back door.

Rushing River, a Native American chief, dismissed the idea of chasing after someone, comparing it to chasing a moose-deer. The chief implied that Softswan, a strong and fast woman, wouldn't slow down Big Tim. The chief's followers agreed and began taking possession of goods in a hut. Softswan revealed a hidden cave with a trap-door, using a torch to light it up. She cleverly balanced a rock with a table to prevent the door from moving.

Big Tim excitedly pointed to the setup his father had created in the hut. He explained how his father strategically placed squibs, Roman candles, and crackers around the walls to converge at the center near the fireplace. The crackers were hidden in holes in the walls, all connected by a fuse leading into a cave. Although they hadn't tested it, the plan was to ignite the setup to surprise any intruders. Meanwhile, Rushing River and his fellow savages, under the influence of rum, started boasting and arguing. Rushing River, the chief, insulted his comrades, leading to a tense atmosphere. Suddenly, a mysterious fizzing sound from below startled them all. The crackers set off, causing chaos as flames erupted around them, catching everyone off guard.

The natives shouted and leaped wildly, causing a chaotic scene. They hurried to the door in a frenzied rush, but got stuck. Rushing River attempted to push them through without success. Another brave soul took a daring leap over the crowd and landed outside unharmed. Big Tim, understanding the situation, quickly removed the table, allowing the trapped individuals to escape. He then cheered them on as they fled into the woods. Later, the preacher was helped up and settled in the hut.

One day, an agent arrived in an Indian village where Little Tim lived with his wife Brighteyes. The agent aimed to collect wild animals for menageries. Little Tim, known for his skills, was sought out by the agent. After preparing a net from buffalo hides, Little Tim ventured into the mountains. Setting up a trap for a large bear, he climbed a tree and enjoyed a meal while waiting. Little Tim reflected on contentment and the simple joys of life as he waited for his prey under the moonlight.

"Inserting at this point a chunk of the meat, which was a bit too big for chewing, he stopped until the path was somewhat cleared, and then continued--""I'm not talking about that lazy kind of satisfaction that makes a man feel comfortable and indifferent to others' problems as long as he's well-fed.

Another chunk blocking the way led to a longer pause, which might have been interrupted by wise thoughts, but a noise made the hunter freeze, with food in his mouth and eyes wide. Soon, the sound of breaking twigs indicated an approaching visitor. Little Tim quickly swallowed, put away his knife, gripped his line, and waited.

The bear seemed suspicious, sniffing the air and inspecting the meat. Not picky, he licked it. ""Good!"" thought the bear, or so it seemed, as he bit into it. Realizing it was tied down, he prepared to use force.

This was Little Tim's chance. He released a cord, causing a net to fall over the bear. It worked well, trapping the animal. The bear, surprised but not alarmed, pawed at the net.

One evening, the weary group sat quietly around the small campfire near enemy territory, cautious not to draw attention. They usually settled for cold pemmican but that night, feeling more fatigued, they kindled a fire for warmth. The chief recounted a tale of hope from his past, mentioning a white preacher's words that had touched his heart. His companions listened intently, the firelight reflecting in the chief's eyes. Meanwhile, a band of Blackfeet rode out in search of buffalo, accompanied by Moonlight, Skipping Rabbit, and Umqua. Rushing River had been distant, while Eaglenose, in contrast, engaged in playful banter with Moonlight, much to Skipping Rabbit's amusement. As preparations for the hunt began, the landscape around them displayed a mix of trees, knolls, forests, and grassy plains, creating a picturesque setting for their journey.|"['1.

After a brief journey across the flat land, the Blackfeet arrived at the edge of a forest where scouts had spotted a herd of buffalo grazing in the vast open plain beyond. Approaching cautiously on hands and knees to avoid being seen, the two Indians were mesmerized by the majestic sight of the buffalo dotting the horizon. The hunters, driven by the need to provide for their families, prepared for a sudden dash towards the game. As the horsemen stood at the bush line, the buffalo grazed peacefully, unaware of the impending chase. The thunder of hooves and the yells of the hunters startled the buffalo into a frantic escape, turning the plains into a chaotic scene of pursuit and slaughter. Despite the successful hunt, some hunters faced minor injuries, yet the tribe would feast on juicy steaks and marrow-bones for days to come. Eaglenose, in his reckless pursuit of an old bull, displayed daring but risky behavior driven by ancestral spirits and a desire for glory.|"['1.
