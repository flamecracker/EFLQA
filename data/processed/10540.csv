Gilbert took the first sip, Kathleen the second, and Nancy the third, and hardly had the last swallow disappeared down the poor aching throats before a carriage drove up to the gate. Some one got out and handed out Mrs. Carey whose step used to be lighter than Nancy's. A strange gentleman, oh! not a stranger, it was the dear Admiral helping mother up the path. They had been unconsciously expecting the brown muff and blue velvet bonnet, but these had vanished, like father, and all the beautiful things of the past years, and in their place was black raiment that chilled their hearts. But the black figure had flung back the veil that hid her from the longing eyes of the children, and when she raised her face it was full of the old love. She was grief-stricken and she was pale, but she was mother, and the three young things tore open the door and clasped her in their arms, sobbing, choking, whispering all sorts of tender comfort, their childish tears falling like healing dew on her poor heart. The Admiral soothed and quieted them each in turn, all but Nancy.

Families come in different shapes, just like geometrical figures. While squares, triangles, and oblongs are common, circles are rare.

The Carey family circle was once complete, filled with love and harmony. But when Captain Carey passed away, the circle was broken, and the family struggled to remain united. Each member faced challenges, especially financially, after losing their father's income. Mrs. Carey had to make difficult decisions, like letting go of their chambermaid and managing with a small pension.

The Crown Princess Kitty, known for her shyness, responded to Gilbert by placing him as the 317th on her waiting list, a gesture that exceeded his expectations. Kitty found the conversation amusing, especially the part about her modesty. Nancy, the eldest of the Carey children, was known for her imaginative storytelling, leading Mother Carey to wonder if she had nurtured a child with exceptional talents. Gilbert, on his first solo journey, encountered a mix-up on the train that left him amused. Despite the initial hiccup, Gilbert's journey proceeded smoothly, and he successfully fulfilled his mission as Mother Carey's chosen ambassador.

Mr. Hamilton told Gilbert four years ago in Boston that he could rent the house if he found respectable tenants. However, there was no demand for houses in Beulah for twenty years, as Bill Harmon, the storekeeper, informed Gilbert. The house had a good structure but needed some paint and paper to look nice. The barn was in disarray due to the Hamilton boys using it as a dance hall. Gilbert explained their financial situation to Colonel Wheeler and Mr. Harmon, who proposed a rent of sixty dollars a year for the house. Gilbert carefully inspected the property, making plans for each room. He sent a telegram to his mother, informing her of the potential rental agreement.

The family swiftly prepared to move to Beulah, leaving behind the somber memories of the past. The children, full of vigor and energy, embraced the change eagerly.

"Mrs. Carey decided to sell her grand piano and exchange it for an old-fashioned square one and a hundred and fifty dollars, inspired by her eldest daughter. The old grand piano had been a wedding gift from a kind uncle. Cousin Ann had gifted them with four tall black and white marble mantel ornaments and a group of clay statuary, causing the family much distress over the years. Nancy, with the help of Kathleen, devised a plan to pack these unwanted items in a barrel before the china-packer arrived. They packed the barrel with the ornaments and the statuary, struggling to contain their laughter throughout the night. Nancy even composed letters to Cousin Ann explaining the ""sad accident"" that had occurred. The night was filled with laughter and joy, with no guilt or regret in sight."|"['1.

Kathleen hurriedly explained that someone had mistakenly gotten off at the wrong station and had to be driven five miles to reach them.

Cousin Ann, who was discontented with the situation at Beulah, had a clash with the hotel landlady over meals. Later, Cousin Ann had an issue with her bedstead, which collapsed during the night, causing a commotion. Despite the mishaps, the family tried to find solutions to make Cousin Ann more comfortable.

Nancy stood by her mother at the window, marveling at the lush greenery outside. She pondered the clarity of the river, the delicate lace-like trees, and the radiant yellow moon.

Nancy and her mother found solace in a passage from the Bible that Nancy read aloud, bringing comfort to their hearts. The words spoke of hope and a place called Beulah where the Lord delights. Nancy imagined her late father finding peace seeing them in the Yellow House at Beulah. Despite their loss, they felt neither forsaken nor desolate, but rather grateful for the love they shared. Julia, Nancy's young sister, was always the epitome of perfection, much to the annoyance of those around her. She was steady and conventional, unlike her flighty mother. Julia's upbringing had been strict, shaping her into a serious and disciplined young girl. Her siblings, who had learned to share and adapt, found her rigid nature somewhat stifling.

Nancy cheerfully aimed to please her mother and eventually the angels, who understood human imperfections. She cleverly compared her sister Julia to a tasteless recipe, not made of dust like the rest of them. Julia's obsession with the wealthy Gladys Ferguson annoyed Nancy, who urged her to keep such thoughts out of the kitchen. Julia, however, aspired to maintain lofty thoughts amidst daily chores, following Miss Tewksbury's advice. Despite Nancy's inner desire to retaliate against Julia's snootiness, she controlled herself and maintained politeness.

If you plan to bring water from the well to warm the upper rooms with a large stove, paint and paper inside, and maintain the house well, you're preserving and enhancing its value.

While Mrs. Carey chatted with Mr. Lord, Nancy hurriedly crossed the barn floor, recalling a forgotten task. She stepped into the garden and encountered a peculiar young man near the rose trellis, peering into the dance from the open door. Dressed in a formal black dinner-coat and a soft cap, he seemed out of place in Beulah. Initially mistaking him for a friend of the fiddler, Nancy soon recognized a familiarity in his lively dark eyes. Without hesitation, he removed his cap, extended his hand, and remarked on her resemblance to a photograph he possessed of the girl who planted the crimson rambler. As they sat on the piazza steps, the music of The Sultan's Polka filled the air, accompanying the joyful sight of Mrs. Jenks dancing with Peter, exuding youthful energy and happiness. In a playful exchange, Nancy teased Tom Hamilton about his potential attachment to the Yellow House, to which he responded humorously, sparking a lighthearted conversation.|"['1.

Tom Hamilton's arrival and introduction caused a brief delay in the dance. Osh Popham and the fiddler tuned their instruments, joined by Mrs. Carey and Susie at the piano. Tom was torn between dancing with Nancy or watching her. As the barn doors swung open, the moonlight illuminated the fields outside. Nancy's dance with Tom and others was a joy to behold. The Admiral observed each person's unique style. The evening continued with ice cream and a variety of cakes. Susie's piano skills impressed everyone. The night concluded with lively tunes and the clock striking midnight. Guests left happily, their voices fading into the distance.|"[""1.
