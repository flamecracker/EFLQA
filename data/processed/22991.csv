"""I'm afraid that wouldn't work, boys,"" he said presently. ""We would only be caught at it and all tried for spies, and maybe find ourselves in a worse predicament than we now are. Perhaps the German officer will listen to reason when he returns.""

But, though Ned endeavored by every art of conversation at his command to influence the German Captain to change his mind, that individual insisted that since Jimmie had been found in the captured city wearing the uniform of a Russian Cossack he must be treated as one. The only alternative he would admit was that Jimmie must give evidence of his claim that he was not a Russian by enlisting in the German army.

""So,"" decided the German, ""you haf been to riding horses accustomed. Goot. You shall now ride a horse for der Kaiser, und,"" he added meaningly, ""you shall do it vell. You may now say goot bye to dese odder poys und come mit me. Der oath ve vill administer.""

Thunderstruck at the proceedings, but unable to render any assistance to their comrade, the three lads watched Jimmie disappear through the doorway. Then, as they were left quite alone, they turned to one another with an air of dejection.

""In the first place, boys,"" answered Ned, ""I'm mighty glad to hear you ask questions like that.

Ned, Jack, and Harry found themselves in a dire situation with approaching soldiers. Ned quickly discovered a trap door hidden beneath debris and, with his friends' help, positioned a table over it for a swift escape. As they descended into the darkness below, they heard Jack's startled cry. With soldiers closing in, the boys dropped through the trap door, feeling like it took an eternity to reach the ground. In the darkness, they realized they were in a cellar with a smooth stone floor. Amidst the soldiers searching above, the boys cautiously navigated the cellar, aware of the soldiers' presence.

In a short time, the boy successfully made shavings from the board Harry found. He gathered them carefully, ready for the flame from Harry's match. All three boys eagerly huddled as Harry prepared to strike the match. Despite his efforts, Harry's hand trembled a bit during his first attempt. Jack found it strange how matches are used daily without thought but now they needed one desperately. The boy took the shavings from Jack, shielding the flame from drafts, lighting the wood pieces one by one until they all burned brightly. The light illuminated their faces in the darkness. As the soldier lowered his rifle and the oath ceremony ended, the Boy Scout disguised as a Cossack sighed in relief. Jimmie, though obedient outwardly, planned an escape to save his friends from the German army's capture in Peremysl. The German Captain hinted that Jimmie would be staying, causing unease. Jimmie, preparing for any escape, followed the Captain's orders to choose a new uniform, hinting at rough times ahead.|"['1.

Down the road, they found wagons overseen by an officer. The guide halted with a formal salute. After a nod from the officer, the guide explained. Laughter followed the guide's words.

"Everywhere bustled with activity, signaling to Jimmie that the Germans were not just taking over the city but also making other arrangements. This indicated that the commander of the invading forces was gearing up to capitalize on the advantage gained by pursuing the Russian army from Peremysl and planning to deliver a decisive blow. ""I agree to the amendment,"" Jimmie insisted, hoping to gather more information from his guide. He overheard that his regiment might be among the first to chase the Russians, which excited him as he sought revenge for the mistreatment he endured. As Jimmie looked for his guide, he caught sight of the German burning a Cossack uniform. Alarmed, Jimmie grabbed the clothing from the fire.

The three boys were surprised to see a circle of light on the stone floor, coming from a stranger holding an electric searchlight. Ned tried to see the person's feet but couldn't. He felt torn between leaving and knowing who it was. Ned's muscles trembled, but he reached out to his friends, finding comfort in their presence. Suddenly, they heard a door open, feeling a cold draft. The boys moved forward cautiously, feeling stone walls covered in slime. As they walked, they heard a warning hiss and felt the stranger's presence. Ned realized the person was similar in size and clothing to him, smelling of gasoline and grease in the damp air.|"['1.

Before the small group had gone far in the passage, they heard more explosions like the first one. One blast was so loud that it caused rocks to fall around them. Ned stuck close to the guide, while Jack and Harry eagerly huddled near him. As they noticed rocks falling, the guide suddenly turned a corner. Ned was amazed at how the guide navigated in the darkness. When Ned accidentally kicked an object on the floor, he discovered it was a belt filled with cartridges and an automatic pistol. They proceeded cautiously, passing the voices they had heard earlier. Suddenly, a loud explosion shook the passage, causing panic. Jimmie, in his haste, narrowly avoided falling into a fire and burnt his hand. He complained about his clothes and their value, claiming they were gifts from the Russian Czar.|"['1.

Unnoticed by the fighters, many cooks and helpers had gathered to watch the showdown. They cheered on, wanting the battle to continue.

Despite being lighter, Jimmie aimed to make every hit count. He focused on finding an opening for a knockout, ignoring the officers approaching.

Jimmie realized it was best to end the conversation, so he saluted using the Boy Scout form. Von Liebknecht seemed pleased but didn't change his mind.

Jimmie started to respond using the same secret code. He quickly told Ned that the regiment was heading west, likely to Verdun, where fierce battles were ongoing. Jimmie mentioned he couldn't escape during the day but planned to try after nightfall. Suddenly, he signaled a warning that someone was nearby. Unfortunately, Ned didn't grasp the message in time, and Jimmie realized he was the one in danger too late. While focusing on Ned's signals, Jimmie missed the approaching soldier's footsteps. The soldier swiftly grabbed Jimmie, squeezing his neck tightly. Jimmie struggled to breathe but eventually stopped fighting, hoping to ease his breathing. The soldier released him, and despite Jimmie's disdainful expression, the soldier accused him of aiding enemy spies. Jimmie, playing it cool, suggested they return to camp.

The guard stopped Jimmie and his companion, demanding answers before allowing them to proceed. Convinced of the urgency of their message for the Captain, the guard directed them to wait while he informed the officers inside the tent. After explaining the situation, the guard led them inside.

In the aircraft, the man's approving look shifted between Ned and Harry. He then searched for Jack to nod at him, but Jack was nowhere to be found, causing surprise. Turning to Ned, he placed a hand on the boy's arm, startling him. Ned's sudden reaction almost caused the aircraft to descend rapidly. Despite Ned regaining control, they lost altitude, bringing them closer to German soldiers. Jimmie, wide-eyed, hesitated when questioned by von Liebknecht about a packet he rescued. The group in the tent showed unfriendly expressions, suspecting Jimmie of being a spy. Jimmie explained the packet's origin truthfully, but von Liebknecht found the story improbable.

Jimmie acknowledged that they had arrived at the right place where his friends' airplane was parked. Excitedly, he pointed out that his friends were starting the plane. Suddenly, a shot was fired from below, followed by shouts and exclamations from soldiers. Sounds from the ground were clearly heard at their high altitude in the aircraft. To avoid danger, Ned swiftly piloted the Eagle away from the rifle range. Harry noted how difficult it was to spot soldiers in their uniforms that blended with the landscape. They planned to rescue Jack, who was hanging on for dear life, by using a line to stabilize the aircraft. Harry explained the strategy of balancing the machine while reaching out to help Jack.|['1.

Jimmie, feeling a surge of spite, expressed his desire to be a spy but was quickly reminded by his friend that Boy Scouts value integrity over espionage.

Ignoring Fritz's struggle to recover from Jimmie's attack, the boy dashed ahead to grab the dangling rope. With excitement, he envisioned grabbing the line and being lifted to safety. Grateful for his gym training, he flexed his muscles in readiness. Meanwhile, the Eagle pilot, Ned, skillfully maneuvered the aircraft for a swift rescue.

The boy explained that a wounded man had given him a packet with instructions to retrieve papers from a safe deposit vault in New York. The man wanted to rectify his wrongdoings. The boy's honesty was acknowledged, but there was concern that the man might have misled them to pass false information to the Russians. The boy affirmed their neutrality in the war and reluctance to engage in conflict unless for self-defense or protecting their country. Despite being held back temporarily, they were assured they would not be asked for more than they could provide. An officer hurriedly directed them to join the Uhlans mounting their horses. As they approached the Kaiser, the boys' horse became restless, causing a slight commotion. While trying to calm the horse, one of the boys inadvertently moved closer to the Kaiser.
