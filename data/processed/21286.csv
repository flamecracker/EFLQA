Old Mother Nature had been absent for a while, working on other parts of the world. King Eagle, perched on a mountain cliff, pondered the situation. He decided to send a messenger to find her.

He explained that a true king faces challenges alongside his subjects. King Eagle set out into the unknown Great World. Days passed with no sign of him, and the birds considered choosing a new king.

In the Green Forest, King Eagle arrived exhausted, but none of the other birds dared to greet him because they had cowardly chosen a new king. Only little Mr. Hummer welcomed him.

When she announced the new land was ready, she praised King Eagle's bravery and turned his head snowy white, making his family rulers forever.

Mr. Mink was never satisfied. He excelled in running, climbing, and hunting, but he wanted to swim well too. Determined, he practiced holding his breath underwater like his cousin, Mr. Otter. With perseverance, he improved his swimming skills, even out-swimming Mr. Muskrat. However, drying off after swimming was a hassle. During a tough time of scarcity, Mr. Mink's fishing skills kept him well-fed. Impressed by his efforts, Old Mother Nature gifted him with a waterproof coat, making him a famous fisherman. Meanwhile, Peter Rabbit couldn't believe when Old Mr. Toad claimed he could sing.

A few days later, Peter visited the Smiling Pool to see Grandfather Frog. A chorus of joy surrounded the pool, sung by unseen Hylas, cousins of Sticky-toes the Tree Toad. Peter sat quietly, trying to spot one of them. A new, sweet note caught his attention, coming from the shallow water. To his surprise, it was Old Mr. Toad with a strange bag under his chin, singing beautifully. Ignoring Peter, Old Mr. Toad continued his melody.

Little Mr. Squirrel found six nuts in a hollow tree, a gift from old King Bear. After eating two, he decided to save the rest. Curious about the nuts, he remembered hiding them there long ago. This sparked an idea in his mind - to store nuts for the future. The following fall, when nuts were abundant, he filled the hollow tree with food, ensuring he had plenty to eat all winter.

Old Mr. Deer loved the open meadows, where he could run swiftly with his slim legs. But he worried about Mr. Wolf and Mr. Dog catching him. When he lost his horns, he felt helpless and hid in the bushes. He struggled to run fast among obstacles. Feeling trapped, he met Mr. Hare, who inspired him to learn to jump. Mr. Deer practiced jumping over bushes, logs, and stumps. It was tough, but he improved little by little. He realized that jumping could help him escape his enemies.

Once upon a time, Mr. Deer was unaware that Old Mother Nature was observing him closely. When she finally confronted him, Mr. Deer explained his desire to learn to jump higher, not out of complaint but to enhance the blessings he already had. Old Mother Nature, crossly, challenged him to jump over a bush nearly as tall as himself. Despite his initial doubt, Mr. Deer bravely attempted the jump and was astonished to clear the bush effortlessly. This newfound jumping ability became a gift from Old Mother Nature, allowing the Deer to thrive in thick brush and tangled forests, outmaneuvering their enemies.

Once upon a time, a little squirrel named Mr. Squirrel decided to improve his jumping skills. Every night, he would sneak off to practice jumping by himself. He would climb an old stump and leap as far as he could, repeating this exercise many times. With dedication and practice, Mr. Squirrel discovered that by spreading his arms and legs out wide and making himself flat, he could jump almost twice as far and land more smoothly. One moonlit night, Old Mother Nature saw Mr. Squirrel's efforts and was pleased. She gave him skin between his legs that acted like wings. With newfound courage, Mr. Squirrel made an incredible jump, gliding through the air and landing lightly on a distant tree. From then on, he was known as the Flying Squirrel, a testament to his determination and the rewards of hard work.|"['1.

One day, Mr. Weasel found a nest with baby birds instead of eggs. He killed them, enjoying their taste. He then found young mice to eat. The little animals were afraid, suspecting larger hunters due to food scarcity. Mr. Rabbit caught Mr. Weasel eating young mice and told everyone. Mr. Weasel joined bigger hunters, making the little animals fear him. When Mr. Weasel hunted excessively, even big hunters rejected him.

Old Mother Nature observed the owl closely and decided when it was time to end its punishment. She made sure the owl's eyes were fixed straight ahead but granted it the ability to turn its head further than any other creature. This unique trait allowed owls to look behind them without moving their bodies. Peter Rabbit felt troubled after a chat with Johnny Chuck, who was getting fat for winter hibernation.

Mr. Chuck, also known as Mr. Greedy, spent his days eating voraciously, leading him to be called by his neighbors as Mr. Greedy. Unfazed by the nickname, he continued to eat, growing fatter each day until he could hardly move. As the days grew colder, Mr. Chuck realized that his extra weight kept him warm. One morning, facing Jack Frost, he noticed the frozen landscape and decided to hibernate. Old Mother Nature found him asleep, understanding that he had stored enough fat to survive the winter comfortably. When spring arrived, Mr. Chuck woke up, unaware of the hardships his neighbors faced. He had unknowingly prepared for winter by hibernating.

One sunny morning, Mr. Otter decided to stroll in the Green Forest. As he ventured farther than planned, he heard quiet footsteps behind him. Glancing back, he spotted Mr. Lynx approaching with hungry eyes and fierce claws. Quickly realizing he was in danger, Mr. Otter dashed towards a nearby spring-hole, his short legs carrying him surprisingly fast. Even though he slid down hills to gain speed, Mr. Lynx, snarling and leaping, was gaining on him. Gasping for breath, Mr. Otter reached a steep bank above the water. With no time to spare, he flung himself down the bank, splashing into the safety of the cold water. Mr. Lynx, afraid of water, stood growling at the edge. Despite the scare, Mr. Otter found the slide thrilling and decided to repeat the adventure many times that day, making the slide even smoother with each joyful descent.|"['1.

Mr. Otter enjoyed sliding down his snow slide until the arrival of spring melted the snow. Adapting quickly, he created a mud and clay slippery-slide, which he improved over time. This inventive solution brought him joy year-round. Grandfather Frog advised Peter Rabbit to appreciate what he has, emphasizing the importance of contentment. Meanwhile, Drummer the Woodpecker found joy in drumming on a hollow tree, a sound he cherished as music. His drumming often led to exchanges with family members, creating a symphony in the Green Forest. As Drummer beat his long roll, a scratching sound inside the tree caught his attention, sparking curiosity and anticipation.|"['1.

Drummer glanced up and saw Unc' Billy Possum peering out of his doorway, looking sleepy and cross. Unc' Billy politely asked Drummer to find another drum as he had a headache. Drummer apologized and agreed to leave. Despite the regret in his voice, he flew off to find a new tree. Unc' Billy winked at Peter Rabbit, knowing Drummer would soon be upset. As Drummer drummed on the chestnut-tree, a commotion broke out, likely due to Brer Coon being disturbed. Unc' Billy chuckled and left for a nap. Drummer, looking annoyed, flew back to Unc' Billy's tree and drummed loudly. The noise made Peter head to the Smiling Pool, laughing all the way.|"[""1.

Peter reached the Smiling Pool, still chuckling. Grandfather Frog, watching, soon found himself smiling too. Laughter is contagious! After sharing a joke about Unc' Billy Possum, the sound of Drummer the Woodpecker's drumming echoed from Unc' Billy's home. Grandfather Frog settled in, ready to share a tale about Drummer's red cap. Long ago, Drummer's ancestor was a plain bird who felt lonely and envied other birds' colorful feathers. To combat his loneliness, he drummed on trees and hunted for worms. When worms threatened the Green Forest, Mr. Woodpecker worried while others ignored the danger. Despite being laughed at, he cared deeply for the forest and sought a solution.|"[""1.

Mr. Woodpecker noticed a problem in the Green Forest and decided to take action. He worked tirelessly from morning till night, hunting worms to save the trees. Despite being laughed at by his neighbors, he persisted in his efforts. Eventually, Old Mother Nature acknowledged his hard work and made him the policeman of the trees, rewarding him with a bright red cap. Overjoyed, Mr. Woodpecker drummed in the forest to express his happiness. Meanwhile, Peter Rabbit pondered the mystery of Sticky-toes the Tree Toad's climbing abilities compared to other toads.

Peter hesitated before approaching Old Mr. Toad, unsure if his question was important enough for a story. But he gathered his courage and asked why Sticky-toes, a frog, could climb trees when toads couldn't. Old Mr. Toad chuckled and began a tale about their ancient ancestors. He explained how the toads and frogs were the first to explore the land when it was new. Despite warnings, a brave little frog decided to join the toads on their adventures. Together, they helped Old Mother Nature by catching bugs that harmed the plants. When the plants grew out of reach, the frog cleverly devised a way to catch the pests.

Longlegs, the heron, was a peculiar bird with very long legs and a long neck. He was often made fun of by his neighbors for his awkward appearance. Feeling ashamed, he tried to hide as much as possible. He found solace in the tall rushes by the Smiling Pool, where he could hide and hunt for fish. Longlegs discovered that his long legs were useful for wading in the water and staying hidden from those on land. Despite his clumsiness, he would try to catch fish every day, but his loud splashing often scared them away.

"One day, Mr. Heron was tired from hunting and decided to rest by the rushes. His long neck ached, so he laid it back on his shoulders. As he rested, he felt the cool water around his feet. Despite being comfortable, he was hungry. Suddenly, a school of little fish swam towards him. Mr. Heron stayed perfectly still, and when the fish came close, he swiftly caught one.
