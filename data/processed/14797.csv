Timmy Tiptoes was enjoying the breeze when he decided it was time to gather nuts for the upcoming seasons. His wife, Goody Tiptoes, was preparing their cozy nest for the winter. However, trouble arose when the forgetful squirrel, Silvertail, started digging up nuts that weren't his, causing a commotion in the wood. The other squirrels, misled by a little bird's song, accused Timmy Tiptoes of the mischief. They squeezed him into a hole until he confessed. Meanwhile, Timmy found himself in a dark, underground bed with sore ribs. A friendly Chipmunk brought him light and encouraged him to eat nuts to escape. While Timmy indulged, Goody stored nuts under a tree root, leading to a surprise encounter with the Chipmunk.|"['1.
