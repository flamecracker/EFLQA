"Far up on the side of Blue Mountain, Cuffy Bear lived with his family in a stone cave. The cave was fireproof and nestled into the mountain, protecting them from falling trees in the wind. Cuffy had a habit of hitting his sister, Silkie, when he got angry, earning him the nickname ""Cuffy."" Despite efforts to improve his behavior, Cuffy struggled to control his temper.

Cuffy Bear refused to join Silkie on an adventure to the pine woods. Determined, Cuffy ventured alone and discovered the familiar old tree, albeit smaller due to his growth during hibernation. From the tree's top, he spotted movement below. Curious, he hurried towards it and encountered a porcupine. Feeling hungry, Cuffy, ignoring his mother's advice, attempted to strike the porcupine but ended up with painful quills in his paws. Mrs. Bear had to remove them, leaving Cuffy unable to feed himself. Learning his lesson, Cuffy never touched a porcupine again. Once his paws healed, Cuffy explored Blue Mountain, reveling in his freedom from pain. He stumbled upon a shiny tin bucket attached to a tree, sparking his curiosity once more.|"['1.

When Cuffy woke up, he saw his father had returned. Mr. Bear sat with Cuffy and Silkie, explaining maple-sugar. Cuffy had found a sugar-maple tree tapped by Farmer Green for sap. Mr. Bear warned Cuffy to avoid the area where the trees were tapped. Cuffy felt a shiver at the mention of Farmer Green. Later, Cuffy and Silkie played at making maple-sugar, pretending the trees were maples. Cuffy longed for real maple-sugar, finding the snow cakes tasteless. He struck the snow in frustration, then sneaked down the mountainside. He reached a clearing and watched a man at a house, carrying wood and tending to a fire.|"['1.

Cuffy was full of excitement and trembling as the wind blew in his face, carrying two distinct scents. One smell was unpleasant, making his legs restless, while the other was sweet and alluring, urging his nose forward. Despite the instinct of his legs to run away, Cuffy's nose prevailed. He found a sugar-house and eagerly indulged in the maple-sugar inside. Curious, he approached a pan of bubbling syrup, dipping his paws in. The hot syrup stuck to his paws, causing him to panic and run outside to cool them in a snowbank. Unaware of his surroundings in his haste, Cuffy headed towards where the man had vanished.|"['1.

Once, a young bear named Cuffy had a frightful encounter when he accidentally stumbled upon a man near the sugar-house fire. Startled by Cuffy's shrieks, the man and Cuffy locked eyes before Cuffy swiftly turned and dashed away. Despite the fear racing through his heart, Cuffy ran up the mountainside, his paws sticky with snow. Exhausted, he finally reached his father's house, hiding behind a knoll. Overcome with weariness, Cuffy nibbled at the snow on his paws, discovering sweet maple-sugar beneath. Forgetful of his burns, Cuffy relished the sugary treat, finding it sweeter than anything he had ever tasted. As spring approached, Cuffy realized the snow was melting each day, signaling the change of seasons.|"['1.

Cuffy, a young bear, decided to explore the valley to witness the ice melting himself. He imagined a loud noise and hoped to find fish for lunch. Sneaking away while his parents were busy, Cuffy reached the river to find floating ice. Startled by a fish, he grabbed it, causing the ice to crack and drift away with him on it. Frightened and alone, Cuffy lamented his decision and feared never seeing his family again. As he floated downstream, nearing Farmer Green's house, he spotted a figure approaching. Hushing his cries, Cuffy hoped to avoid detection, but the figure turned out to be sliding towards the river.|"['Question 1:\nWhat motivated Cuffy to explore the valley?\nA) He wanted to find a new home.\nB) He was looking for his lost toy.\nC) He wanted to witness the ice melting.\nD) He was searching for berries to eat.\nE) He was following his friends.', ""Question 2:\nWhat caused the ice to crack and drift away with Cuffy on it?\nA) A sudden gust of wind.\nB) Cuffy's loud noise.\nC) Another bear's attack.\nD) The weight of the fish.\nE) Cuffy's jumping on the ice."", 'Question 3:\nHow did Cuffy feel when he realized he was floating downstream alone?\nA) Excited.\nB) Relieved.\nC) Frightened.\nD) Confused.\nE) Indifferent.', ""Question 4:\nWhat was Cuffy's initial reaction upon seeing a figure approaching near Farmer Green's house?\nA) Relief.\nB) Joy.\nC) Curiosity.\nD) Fear.\nE) Anger."", ""Question 5:\nWhat was Cuffy's plan when he saw the figure sliding towards the river?\nA) To ask for help.\nB) To hide in the bushes.\nC) To jump into the water.\nD) To run back home.\nE) To avoid detection."", ""Question 6:\nWhat can be inferred about Cuffy's character from the text passage?\nA) He is brave and adventurous.\nB) He is careless and irresponsible.\nC) He is obedient and cautious.\nD) He is selfish and greedy.\nE) He is timid and dependent.""]"|['C) He wanted to witness the ice melting.', 'D) The weight of the fish.', 'C) Frightened.', 'D) Fear.', 'E) To avoid detection.', 'A) He is brave and adventurous.']
Mr. Bear was furious and pushed Cuffy into the river. Cuffy, scared and naughty, started to scream as he sank into the cold water. But to his surprise, he found he could swim just like his father, as little bears don't need to learn to swim. As a punishment, Cuffy had to go to bed for the rest of the day. Although he felt embarrassed, his parents found it funny how he floated down the river on a cake of ice. Later, Cuffy and his sister Silkie saw their father returning home with a strange animal that looked harmless. Cuffy poked it with his paw and realized it had soft quills that didn't prick him.|"[""1.

As Mr. Bear strolled home, Cuffy and Silkie rushed in, shouting about a surprise. Cuffy, who had never ventured far up Blue Mountain, was growing fast. Climbing higher each day, he finally reached the mountain's peak. There, with no trees in sight, he explored the rocky terrain. While descending, he found a massive bird's nest with two large white eggs. Hungry from the climb, he cracked one open to eat. Suddenly, he heard a loud cry and looked up to see a gigantic bird diving towards him with sharp beak and claws. It was a terrifying sight for Cuffy, who never imagined such a massive bird existed.|"[""1.

Once more, Cuffy tumbled down to the ground. Quickly, he sprang up and ran. Unfortunately, Mrs. Eagle caught him this time. She swooped down, digging her sharp claws into Cuffy's neck. Flapping her wings vigorously, Mrs. Eagle lifted Cuffy high into the sky. Terrified, Cuffy feared being dropped onto the rocks below or becoming the eagles' dinner. Mrs. Eagle initially planned to carry Cuffy to her nest on the mountain, but his weight made her descend. Weakened, Mrs. Eagle struggled to fly higher and eventually had to release Cuffy.

Cuffy Bear found himself clinging onto branches after a wild tumble. Finally, catching his breath, he cautiously made his way down to the ground. As he looked around, the place seemed oddly familiar, and to his surprise, he saw his father's house door right in front of him, thanks to Mrs. Eagle's unexpected drop-off. Cuffy learned that his father's birthday coincided with a significant forest fire, making it rare for him to have another birthday celebration anytime soon. Disappointed by the news, Cuffy contemplated sneaking to Farmer Green's to steal another pig for a feast. Carefully avoiding Farmer Green and his workers, Cuffy managed to snatch a pig from the farm without being noticed, feeling brave and sly as he made his way back home.|"[""1.

Cuffy Bear had a frightening encounter with a pig that left him scared of even the slightest noise. The pig's squealing was so loud that Cuffy felt like he had a hundred pigs in his mouth. The sound was so terrifying that Cuffy ran away as fast as he could. After this incident, Cuffy was too scared to venture far from home and even the sight of a crow made him dizzy. However, his curiosity led him to the valley where he saw Farmer Green's mowing-machine in action. Initially scared of the machine's noise, Cuffy soon became fascinated by it.

Cuffy, a mischievous bear, felt thrilled when he stumbled upon a mowing-machine in the valley after sneaking away from home against his parents' wishes. As he explored the area near the forest, his senses tingled with curiosity. Suddenly, a strange scent caught his attention. Intrigued, Cuffy followed his nose and discovered a hidden basket filled with tempting treats - the haymakers' lunch! Unable to resist, Cuffy devoured everything inside the basket, from bread-and-butter to custard pie and even baked beans. Despite his messy face smeared with custard, Cuffy relished every bite.

Cuffy was out in the forest on a hot summer day feeling uncomfortable with a bean-pot stuck on his nose. He tried to get rid of it by hitting it against a rock, but it didn't budge. As he made his way home, his family laughed at the sight of him, making Cuffy whimper. Sitting under a tree, he pondered how to remove his thick coat. While sitting still, he observed the forest around him. He saw a squirrel, a crow, and bees buzzing around.

Cuffy Bear was thrilled by the idea of finding a bee-tree and enjoying all the honey he could eat. He followed the bees, eagerly tracking them to their tree. After patiently waiting and watching, he finally spotted a bee entering a hole in a nest hanging from a limb. Excited, Cuffy climbed the tree, reached the nest, and poked his paw inside. Suddenly, a loud roar erupted from the nest, startling Cuffy. A swarm of bees buzzed out, causing Cuffy to quickly retract his paw.

Cuffy, the bear, let out a loud roar as the bees stung him all over. Despite his cries of pain, the bees kept stinging him, even targeting his eyes and ears. Frantically, Cuffy tried to swat them away, but they kept coming back. Feeling like he was being pricked with pins, he forgot all about the honey and just wanted to escape. Desperate, he dashed towards the brook, with the bees buzzing around him. When he reached the water, Cuffy leaped in, causing a big splash and disappearing beneath the surface. The bees, unable to follow him into the water, circled above, waiting to sting him again once he resurfaced.|['1.

Cuffy quickly dipped underwater and swam to the other side of the pool. To his surprise, the bees were waiting for him. He swam to the opposite side near a large boulder, but the bees followed. Cuffy had to keep submerging his head to avoid the bees' stings. Exhausted, he found a shallow spot to stand in the brook, with just enough water to cover him, allowing him to poke his nose out for air. The bees continued to sting him every time his nose surfaced. Cuffy remained in the water until sundown when the bees finally left. Cold and numb, he returned home to find his family at dinner. His swollen face and eyes made him unrecognizable, causing his mother to fear he had black measles. She hurriedly took his sister away to prevent any possible infection.|"['1.

Cuffy Bear felt very sad because his family didn't recognize him due to the bee stings on his face. His father even asked him to leave the house. However, after a while, his father finally recognized him by his voice. Cuffy's mother then comforted him by licking his face to soothe the bee stings. It took Cuffy two days to fully recover. Later, Cuffy and his father went to the bee-tree, where Cuffy had gotten stung. They found out that Cuffy had mistakenly put his paw into a hornet's nest instead of a bee's nest. Despite the mishap, Cuffy enjoyed watching trout in a pool and even played with his reflection in the water, pretending it was another bear cub. Cuffy wished he had more bear cubs to play with, as his sister was younger and a girl.|"[""1.

Cuffy was having a great time dancing on a big boulder when he noticed a little bear in the water below mimicking his moves. As they waved at each other, Cuffy suddenly saw another little bear on the opposite bank of the brook. To his surprise, the bear on the other side looked just like him. Cuffy realized it was a real bear, not a reflection. Excited, Cuffy hurried to meet the bear named Pete. Pete showed Cuffy a new way to play by sliding down the bank into a deep pool.

Cuffy wanted to show Pete that he could do it too. Despite wearing his best trousers, Cuffy sat at the top of the bank and slid down into the water with a loud splash. Both Cuffy and his new friend Pete continued to slide down the bank, getting covered in mud. Cuffy's trousers even got two big holes in them. Although Cuffy was having fun, he got somewhat angry when Pete hit him. Cuffy tried to hit back but missed, and Pete poked him hard in the stomach, making Cuffy groan. When Mrs. Bear found out about Pete, she warned Cuffy not to play with him because Pete's family were rough and not nice bears.

Mr. Bear hurried his family towards the lake on the other side of the mountain. Suddenly, a raindrop hit his eye, signaling the start of a heavy downpour.
