In a dim room, a silent exchange passed between Marco and his father, Loristan. Marco's gaze fixed on the remnants of a modest meal, his thoughts consumed by the revelation that a descendant of the Lost Prince of Samavia lived. This descendant, Ivor Fedorovitch, walked the earth, carrying the bloodline of royalty. Loristan, a man of few words, shared the tale of how a forester in the Austrian Alps unknowingly bore the spirit of the Lost Prince. The forester's encounters with the Samavian people ignited a secret society's formation, dedicated to the return of their king. Tears shed under the vast night sky signified a shared hope for the prince's return. Though the forester passed without witnessing the society's growth, his legacy lived on in the hearts of those who longed for Samavia's restoration.|"[""1.

Yes. He had a son named Ivor, trained as I told you. That part I knew was true, though I should have believed it even without knowing. There has _always_ been a king ready for Samavia, even when he worked with his hands and served others. Each took the oath of allegiance. For years, secret work has been done, and the Fedorovitch party has grown, more powerful than others realize. Larger countries seek peace and reliable laws due to Samavia's disorder. Samavian patriots have worked secretly to make friends in powerful capitals for their land's future. King Maran's assassination led to talks of a new king.

"The curved line in front of him only chuckled or laughed openly. Its members appeared unperturbed by his casual behavior towards them. Evidently, he had something amusing to share, compensating for his domineering and aloof manner. Plunging his hand into a pocket of his tattered coat, he extracted a piece of newspaper. ""There isn't much here. I wish there was more,"" The Rat grumbled. ""Read this. They say it might not be accurate, but I believe it is.

The Rat was brimming with excitement as he shared his ideas with Marco. He envisioned a character who, despite being poor and shabby, held a secret within him. The Rat admired the idea of this character walking confidently, sneering at those who mocked him and keeping his head held high.

As Marco stood in the shadows, he heard footsteps approaching. Quickly, he blended into the darkness to avoid being seen. Once the policeman passed, Marco emerged and strolled down the road cautiously, glancing around and occasionally looking back. Initially, the street was deserted until a jovial hansom-cab passed by, its occupants too engrossed in their revelry to notice Marco. After a brief silence, a sleepy vegetable-wagon trundled past, its driver almost dozing amidst the produce. As the road fell quiet again, Marco's anxiety grew, hoping his father wouldn't feel the passing time as keenly. The weight of their mission weighed heavily on Loristan, knowing the importance of the imminent meeting with a distinguished man who conversed with royalty. Marco pondered on the significance this encounter held for the Secret Party, the heartbeat of Samavia. Suddenly, Marco detected approaching footsteps, signaling the arrival of a man. Marco subtly quickened his pace, assuming the guise of a boy on an urgent errand, possibly fetching a doctor. As the man drew nearer, Marco realized he was not the distinguished figure he anticipated, but a younger individual, whistling a light tune as they passed each other without a second glance.|"['1.

"After the police officer finished patrolling the area for the third time, Marco heard footsteps approaching from a distant cross street. He positioned himself where he could observe the street. A man in worn clothes and a shadowy hat walked towards him. Marco recognized him as the man who had traveled with the King. As the man passed, Marco whispered, ""The Lamp is lighted,"" signaling their secret meeting. The man continued walking without looking back. This encounter confirmed that Marco's father's plans were progressing. The mention of the man as a prince was merely a title, indicating his importance. Marco spent the day at the Tower of London, immersing himself in the historical stories of the past.

A guide in a traditional Beef-eaters' outfit led a small group on a sightseeing tour. The guide, resembling Henry the Eighth, shared stories enthusiastically, especially by the spot where Lady Jane Grey was executed. He explained how her fate was tied to English history and the Duke of Northumberland's failed plans. Meanwhile, another visitor mentioned a battle in Samavia, a country in the news, where he feared a plague might spread.

"Marco, a boy with a distinguished air, had been quietly trained in self-control and grace. Feeling a sense of urgency, he paced the room, his eyes intense. Determined, he declared, ""Something must stop it! The time has come."" His companion agreed, and they both knew action was needed. Marco then joined a group called the Secret Party, where The Rat shared tales of hidden swords and guns. To The Rat, this was more than a game; it was a mission.

The Rat spoke with fervor about being comrades in a game that made them ready to labor for Samavia. His excitement grew as he envisioned being in the midst of the battle for the Lost Prince, carrying messages under a rain of bullets. The thought of finding the Found King and offering to serve him filled him with determination. The idea of being messengers for the Secret Party thrilled him.

A year later, Marco vividly remembered the evening as an unforgettable experience that would stay with him forever. The small, dimly lit back room with a single gas-burner, the iron box holding maps and plans, and the dignified figure of Loristan, despite his worn clothes, all left a lasting impression. Loristan's intense gaze and deep interest in their discussions showed his seriousness. Marco explained how The Rat, unlike the other Squad members, devotedly planned battles, drawing inspiration from his father's knowledge and late-night conversations. Loristan praised The Rat's map of Samavia and acknowledged his strategic skills, even suggesting that The Rat's tactics could have changed the outcome of battles.

Despite his initial hesitation, Marco's fervor caught Loristan's attention. Loristan always respected the way Marco's thoughts led him to conclusions, fostering a strong bond between them. As they discussed the Secret Party's preparations, Marco painted a vivid picture of vagabond boys, including a cripple and a street singer, who could move freely and gather valuable information unnoticed. Marco's detailed and realistic plans intrigued Loristan, who, lost in thought, approved of the scheme.

She attended her sister's wedding, so I planned to spend the day alone. I adjusted my schedule to accommodate her. You are so kind! I will be comfortable soon. I can now relax in my easy chair in the sitting room after resting a bit. The house was typical of early-Victorian London. It had a front lobby leading to a dining room and a back lobby with a basement kitchen staircase. The sitting room overlooked a gloomy backyard surrounded by high walls. It was dimly lit but had a few luxurious items among the usual furnishings. There was a cozy easy chair with a small table holding a silver lamp and elegant trinkets.

Two days before departing Moscow, a man recounted a visit from three peasant-like individuals to the girl's father, discussing matters for over an hour and presenting a parchment. The girl, referring to Stefan Loristan as a spy and adventurer, questioned his motives and the whereabouts of a bribe from Maranovitch. She speculated on Marco's ignorance or fear due to mistreatment. Despite her emotional outburst, Marco remained composed and indifferent.

The man calmly warned Marco that he could be trapped in the dark wine-cellar for a long time. The inquisitor questioned him about his whereabouts and plans. Marco knew he couldn't call for help and felt unsure about what to do next. Despite his fear, he tried to remain brave.

In the quiet aftermath of the fading echoes, Marco took a deep breath. Surprisingly, it felt like a relief amidst the whirlwind of emotions he had just experienced. Facing the shocking truth upstairs had left his mind racing with thoughts that seemed to come too quickly to grasp. Could he trust what he had seen and heard? In his conversations with his father, they delved into the power of thoughts and the strength they hold. Marco learned from his father's travels to the East about the belief in the manifestation of desires through clear and noble thoughts. Remembering a tale of an old hermit in India, Marco focused on the wisdom shared about the creation of reality through thought.

The presence of the harmless living things provided companionship. The boy sat near the low shelf, listening to the comforting purring of the mother cat, occasionally reaching out to feel her warm fur. The green phosphorescent light in her eyes brought him comfort. Despite not having much to eat, he was accustomed to fasting during his journeys and found it bearable. He avoided counting the hours between meals to prevent feeling famished.

Marco found himself trapped in a basement with locked doors. Hungry and desperate, he noticed a coal-scuttle nearby. Realizing it could help him, he threw pieces of coal at a small window above the area door, smashing the glass to create a hole. With each throw, more panes shattered until only the frame remained. As daylight streamed in, he prepared to shout for help. Although unseen from the street, he aimed to draw attention by making noise.

He wanted him to sing for the Squad some day, to make the thing seem real. The Rat had been greatly excited, and had begged for the song often. It was a stirring martial thing with a sort of trumpet call of a chorus. Thousands of Samavians had sung it together on their way to the battle-field, hundreds of years ago.

"Loristan was deeply involved in guiding ""the game"" and assisting with the Secret Two's plans for their mysterious journey.

The journey would lead them to encounters with friendly villagers, those loyal to Maranovitch who remained silent, and others who viewed strangers with suspicion. As they shared stories, The Rat and Marco learned about the country and its people. Marco's memory training involved memorizing faces and their associated places, a task that he took seriously.

Lazarus built a simple easel for Marco's sketches during their secret game. Marco patiently waited as his father and their visitor conversed quietly. The Rat noticed Marco's calm demeanor, not needing attention or words to feel at ease. Marco swiftly sketched the portrait of a woman with a distinctive nose and dark brows, impressing the Prince. He continued drawing different faces as instructed by his father, while The Rat memorized details about each person and their locations. They reviewed notes with directions on how to approach each individual. The game tested their memory and observation skills, preparing them for secretive encounters in various places.|"['1.

"The boys spent the entire day working on a task that required seeking out sketches while maintaining caution. They had to utter specific words discreetly without drawing attention. Marco's familiarity with such exercises made his progress swift, while The Rat, with his extraordinary memory, kept up. Lazarus seemed off, appearing red and restless, clearing his throat nervously.

In the dead of night, a penetrating look from his father stirred him awake, much like Lazarus had awoken him before. The only sound was the silence of the street outside, illuminated solely by a dim lamp. His father's intense gaze revealed pride in his son's youthful maturity and strength, yet also a protective concern for his childlike nature. In a hushed tone, his father spoke in their native Samavian tongue, acknowledging his son's youth and questioning if he could bear the weight of their shared burden. The son, equally quiet, affirmed his understanding, expressing his readiness to embrace the responsibilities placed upon him. As they journeyed from London to Paris, two unassuming boys, one shabby and the other a slow-moving cripple, their unremarkable appearance belied the extraordinary destiny that awaited them.|"['1.

The Rat was so thrilled that he couldn't sleep early. He asked Marco to show him around the lively streets. They strolled along the wide Avenue des Champs Elysees, admiring the sparkling lights among the horse-chestnut trees. The Rat's keen eyes absorbed everything—the cozy glow of cafés nestled among the trees, carriages passing by, people enjoying wine at tables, and the vibrant stream of life heading towards the Arc de Triomphe. The Place de la Concorde, with its grandeur and bustling activity, captivated him. The Rat wanted to soak in every detail, moving from one viewpoint to another, mesmerized by the magnificence. As they explored Paris, they came across a grand house with closed gates and dim lights. They returned daily, hoping to catch a glimpse of a certain person. Eventually, they saw a lady entering the house, sparking a plan to casually cross paths with her.|"[""1.

Tomorrow afternoon, we will observe if her carriage arrives for her. When she comes to the door, I will enter and start pleading. The servant might think I am a foreigner and clueless. You can follow to signal me to leave, as I will likely be asked to depart. If she is kind, she might listen, and you could get close to her. The Rat always viewed him as his leader. He had asked to serve Marco as his aide-de-camp and was eager to do so. The Rat's dedication sometimes troubled Marco. They avoided lingering near the grand house to avoid drawing attention. The next day, they saw the lady had left when they weren't watching. As they walked, The Rat nudged Marco. They noticed the owner was in a shop, giving them a chance. The carriage had three identical Pekingese spaniels inside, attracting onlookers. The boys lingered, and Marco engaged the lady in French and whispered in Russian. The Rat observed her closely but saw no change in her expression. Throughout their journey, those they signaled showed no sign of understanding the unusual words. The baker's wife, a kind woman, greeted Marco warmly and handed him a small package.|"[""1.

Neither Marco nor The Rat had made any purchases, although the unassuming package was clearly meant for Marco, from a large inexpensive store. It seemed to hold something soft. In their room, The Rat was captivated by the sights of Paris, a stark contrast to his London life, absorbing every detail. Opening the package revealed only ordinary woolen socks at first glance. However, as Marco picked up a sock, he felt something flat and carefully placed inside. To their surprise, it was a stack of old five-franc notes, not new ones to avoid detection. The Rat speculated that a mysterious lady might have cleverly hidden the money in the socks at a common shop to deceive any onlookers. Meanwhile, back in London, efforts were made to discredit the story of the Lost Prince’s descendant to protect the interests of the Secret Party.

In the sleeve of Marco's coat, there was a secret slit where he hid small items. He carried sketches of people, including one of an old man who loved music. The boys strolled through Munich, enjoying the sunny day and the vibrant streets. Despite their casual demeanor, they held a grave secret about a far-off land in turmoil. As they listened to a band play in the square, a grand carriage arrived, carrying the genial old aristocrat from Marco's sketch.

The Chancellor was known for his deep love of music. He would attend the opera every night unless important matters kept him away. Observers would see him enthusiastically applauding and nodding along when he enjoyed a performance. Some felt he should have been a conductor or a cellist due to his passion. On one particular evening at the opera, a young officer and a boy blocked The Rat from getting close to the Chancellor's carriage. The Rat understood the importance of staying out of sight until needed.

Before my father recovered, he decided to journey to the ledge, feeling compelled to seek wisdom from the hermit in Samavia. Weak at the start, he doubted his ability to finish. Traveling partly by bullock cart and partly carried by locals, he was left to climb alone after reaching halfway up the mountain. Surrounded by a stunning forest with exotic trees, vines, scents, flowers, and wildlife, the path became steep and narrow.

The Rat was completely silent, almost as if in a trance, as he listened intently to the vivid story. He was captivated by the tale of climbing higher and higher until reaching a ledge under the vast starry sky. The stars, like immense lamps of radiance, seemed to draw him in.

She opened the door wide, and they heard the silver horn's cheerful call again. The wood and faggots The Rat added to the fire crackled and sparkled, casting light on the road.

He bent and kissed her warmly before his expression shifted, momentarily anxious upon realizing they were only boys. As he inspected them closely, Marco observed his every move.

Late at night, The Rat expressed his concern for Marco's safety, acknowledging that if a choice had to be made between them, Marco should be saved because his father entrusted him with Marco's care.

They both noticed a distinguished man in uniform with emerald plumes, who was a Prince and a close companion of the Emperor.

The two boys trailed the festivity to its conclusion. They reached a point where they could glimpse the church entrance hosting the service and witness the ceremonies at the statue adorned with banners and laurel wreaths. Although they spotted the man with the pale face multiple times, he remained surrounded, and they couldn't approach him closely. However, during a brief gap in the crowd, their eyes met. The man's gaze lingered on the dark, intense face of Marco, piquing his interest. Despite the fleeting connection, the crowd dispersed, separating them. Subsequently, they retreated to the Hofburg, waiting near the grand palace. Although they caught sight of the man during the imperial carriages' return, they remained distant. The following four days were peculiar, filled with elusive encounters. Despite overhearing discussions and tracking his movements, getting close to the Emperor's favorite proved futile. He appeared inaccessible, always accompanied by engrossed companions. Marco and The Rat pursued him across the city, only to find him constantly surrounded, his demeanor aloof yet captivating.|"['1.

Sleep was crucial for Marco and The Rat, as it provided them with strength and courage. They learned the secret of letting go of worries until the right moment. By exploring galleries, museums, and palaces, they found joy and eagerness in discovering new things. The Prince's garden was a favorite spot for them to visit, with a stone balcony overlooking the Fountain Garden. Marco noticed a large evergreen shrub with a hollow inside, ideal for hiding and watching the palace windows. On a warm afternoon, the boys roamed the gardens inconspicuously. The ___portier___ at the entrance gates barely noticed their entrance and exit, distracted by the impending storm. The Rat and Marco observed the sky's battle from the Fountain Garden, hoping the evergreen shrub would provide shelter if the storm hit.|"['1.

Marco found a safe spot to hide in the gardens. He hoped to catch a glimpse of the Prince through the windows of his favorite rooms. As darkness fell, he waited, hoping to see lights in the Prince's chambers. However, as time passed, no lights appeared. The stormy night grew intense with rumbling thunder, flashes of lightning, and heavy rain. Marco decided to stay hidden until morning when the gardens reopened. He settled down to sleep, planning to wake every half-hour to check for any signs of the Prince.

In the midst of a raging storm, Marco stood still, feeling the deafening crashes and blinding flashes around him. Drenched to the skin, he braced himself, waiting for the turmoil to pass. As the storm reached its peak, a temporary lull brought a strange stillness. Suddenly, he heard footsteps approaching through the darkness. Someone was entering the garden through a private entrance. With hope and joy, Marco realized it might be the man with the tired face seeking seclusion. The footsteps passed by and paused nearby.

In the deep darkness of the evergreen hollow, Marco stood, rain streaming down, lost in thought. Ignoring the rain, he peered into the blackness where the windows should be, waiting anxiously. As he focused on the window, he pondered how to reach the person inside. Could his thoughts connect with theirs? Suddenly, the moon broke through the clouds, illuminating the garden. Startled, the Prince appeared on the balcony. Entranced by the moon, he was snapped back by a boy's voice below.|"['1.

"Marco obeyed the instructions given to him. The moonlight illuminated his determined face, showcasing his youthful vigor and dark features, momentarily glowing triumphantly after overcoming obstacles. Raindrops clung to his hair, adding to his picturesque, albeit very wet appearance. He had found the man he sought and conveyed the agreed-upon signal. ""Yes,"" he responded calmly, his voice dragging slightly. ""You are Stefan Loristan's son. You need to be cared for. Come with me. I have instructed my staff to remain in their quarters until I call for them. In my private quarters, there's a safe room where you can dry off and rest.

"Marco's friend walked over to him and spoke quietly by his side. At first, Marco couldn't hear clearly what was being said. He stood still, waiting patiently.

The hushed conversation became slightly louder, and Marco caught the last two sentences: ""an old man who might want to meet you."" The Prince had instructed Marco not to show surprise or recognition, as he was here to be seen, not to see.

Each day, Marco and The Rat grew weaker and more desperate as they traversed the war-torn country. Europe paid little attention to their plight, hoping for an end to the chaos that disrupted trade. Amid the suffering, the boys discovered the land's true beauty and richness, reminiscent of Eden.

Marco and his companion found themselves in the forest one morning, exhausted from their journey. Marco shared a cryptic message he had received, urging them to return to London swiftly. Both boys were eager to meet a priest who held secrets about the Lost Prince, a royal lad hidden by monks long ago. Despite their anticipation, Marco was uncertain if the priest would reveal anything upon receiving a special sign. They planned to visit the priest’s mountain church, resting before the climb. As they slept peacefully, nature’s creatures curiously explored around them, unafraid of the rare visitors.

As the evening descended, a bird's melodious song stirred Marco and The Rat from their slumber. The bird perched nearby, its trill pure and sweet, blending with the fragrant hillside air. Marco, awakening to the enchanting sound, savored the moment, feeling the reality of their presence in Samavia. The Rat, roused by the same tune, shared Marco's awe.

They traversed around the mountain, climbed steep inclines, navigated rocks and fallen trees, and forged through dense thickets. The Rat showcased his agility, while Marco and the priest assisted him using his crutch at times. After nearly two hours, they reached a dense area with a fallen tree and an outcropping rock. The priest paused by the rock, which slowly pivoted, revealing a dimly lit chasm. ""These are the sanctuaries of the Sword Forgers, hidden throughout Samavia,"" the priest informed Marco.

They walked through a narrow, dark passage, down steps, and turned into a corridor carved out of rock and earth. The corridor was wider but still dark. It took years to cut the passage, with walls made of stacked arms. The Rat remembered the story of the mountain herdsmen who banded together over the loss of their prince. The Samavians had sworn an oath five hundred years ago, waiting for the Lighting of the Lamp. The old priest led Marco and The Rat to a big black door, revealing an immense cavern filled with armed men who made obeisance. The men were a diverse group, giants with white hair, young and old, each with an unconquered flame in their eyes. The priest, too excited to speak at first, finally addressed the crowd in a hushed tone, conveying the significance of the moment.|['1.

The Rat, standing back and observing, was taken aback by the frenzied reactions of the men in the cavern. They cried out wildly, embraced passionately, and fell to their knees in joy. Overwhelmed with emotion, they clutched each other, sobbed, and leaped with happiness. The crowd rushed towards Marco, a young boy, kissing his shoes and hands in reverence. The Rat, seeing the intense adoration, felt fear creeping in as the crowd pressed upon Marco. However, the old priest's commanding voice cut through the frenzy, urging the men to step back and show respect. A sense of awe filled the air as a ceremonial ritual began, with the priest moving among the crowd, speaking to them in a solemn manner.

In the cave's far end, a stone altar awaited. Covered in white, above it hung a veiled picture. An ancient metal lamp swung from the roof, casting shadows. Positioned on a stone dais, Marco stood as the priest requested, with his aide close by. Herdsmen entered, each carrying a massive sword, forming an arch over Marco. As they knelt and kissed his hand, a sense of reverence filled the room. The priest then unveiled the picture, revealing a regal figure. Every man, even those holding the swords, knelt in respect. The boy in the painting, a saint to them all, gazed down with a divine smile, uniting the room in awe and devotion.|"[""1.

The Rat stared wide-eyed at Marco and the picture, breathing faster and gnawing his fingers. Marco stepped down dreamily, followed by the old man. Men with swords rose, creating an archway with a clash of steel. All eyes were on Marco as he left, looking young and pale but with his father's smile. It was pouring rain in London as they returned home rapidly. No. 7 Philibert Place was their haven. Marco thought of his father, while The Rat imagined Loristan's proud welcome.

From the moment they left the old priest on the hillside to head back to the frontier, there were long silences between them as they walked or rested in the forest. With their journey completed, a sense of calm settled in. No more plans, no more uncertainties. They were on their way home to No. 7 Philibert Place--Marco to his father, The Rat to the man he admired. Marco was filled with longing to see his father's face, hear his voice, and feel his hand on his shoulder to confirm his reality. The Rat, on the other hand, was restless, gnawing on his fingers, his thoughts racing ahead to London and meeting Loristan.

The path to Philibert Place was short. As they entered the bustling, chaotic street with buses and carts passing by, they felt like they had left their dream far behind. Yet, arriving home, Lazarus promptly opened the door before they could step out of the cab. Cabs rarely stopped at houses in Philibert Place, so Lazarus recognized the travelers. Marco and The Rat stood still, shocked by the old soldier's demeanor. The Rat wiped away tears to look at Marco's changed expression. Marco, now pale and serious, opened an envelope on the desk and read a hurried note. Suddenly, the street erupted with newsboys shouting about the assassination of King Michael Maranovitch. Despite the commotion, Lazarus respectfully reminded Marco of his father's request not to read the newspapers until they could meet again.|"['1.

Lazarus stood, visibly tense but composed, gazing fixedly at the floor. Both The Rat and Marco sensed a significant change in him.

"The most dedicated patriot is like royalty, exclaimed The Rat. ""If there's no greater honor, he'll become a prince, Commander-in-Chief, and Prime Minister! Can't you hear the cheers, songs, and prayers of the Samavians? You'll witness it all! Remember the mountain climber who saved shoes for the Bearer of the Sign? He said a day might come to show them to the people. That day is here! I know how they'll react!"" His voice dropped, ""You'll witness it all. But not me."" ""You were the son's friend,"" Marco replied. ""You served Stefan Loristan's son. We won't speak of this further."" The Rat realized Marco and Stefan Loristan were serious.

"""Your man's been packing up, I notice. He's not got much to carry away, but it won't pass through that front door until I've got what's owing me,"" Mrs. Beedle stated firmly about the next week's rent.

"The train rushed forward, halting only once before Melzarr. At a small station, peasants loaded garlanded flowers and evergreens onto the train. Marco and The Rat noticed something unusual happening. A man on the outside platform secured garlands and handed up flags to workers on the roof. Vorversk explained, ""The villagers got permission to decorate the carriage in honor of Stefan Loristan's son."" As the train stopped, a jubilant crowd greeted them with cheers, tears, and music. Marco, showing strength and composure, saluted the crowd. Amid the frenzy, soldiers guarded a path for them. Passing through the city gates, they saw a mix of majestic ruins and jubilant faces. Despite the war-torn city, the cathedral stood as a symbol of beauty. The crowd, though worn and tattered, exuded hope and elation."|"['1.

The grand Palace was just as impressive as the white cathedral nearby. Marco, the son of the King, felt a mix of excitement and nervousness as he made his way up the wide marble steps, guarded by soldiers. The huge square around the Palace was bustling with people, all held in check by the soldiers. As he entered the Palace, he was met with richly dressed individuals who bowed deeply as he passed by. The ceremony felt overwhelming to the young prince, but he longed to see his father and hear his voice once more. Led through vaulted corridors to a magnificent room, Marco felt like he was in a dream as people bowed before him. Finally, he approached the King, who turned out to be his own father, and knelt before him with love and worship. The bond between father and son, as well as their love for their people, was evident to all. The history of their past and the sacrifices made for their country were shared in a quiet room, where the first King Ivor of Samavia revealed the intense story to his son, the Lost Prince restored.|"['1.
