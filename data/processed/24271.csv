"After finishing the verse, the child who gets the last word is considered ""out"" and steps aside. This continues until only one child remains, who is declared ""it"" or ""takkie."" In some parts of Scotland, a leader assigns a word to each child by inserting his finger into the leader's cap. The child with a word matching the initial of their last name steps out. In America, a leader assigns letters of the alphabet to each child, and if a child's assigned letter matches the initial of their last name, they step out. The commonality of these counting-out rhymes worldwide suggests a shared origin. The rhymes likely originated from ancient customs like casting lots, used in battles, land divisions, and decision-making.

"In Lanark, a game called ""Whuppity Scoorie"" is played by girls in a row. One girl starts by singing verses and choosing another girl to join her. They hold hands, repeat the verses, and perform actions. Then they pick a third girl, and this continues until all are chosen. In the town, the game creates excitement and tradition, with children starting at the church bell, marching around, and engaging in a playful fight using bonnets on strings. The victors parade the streets with a flag. Another game, ""Hinkumbooby,"" involves a circle holding hands, singing, moving sideways, clapping, and wheeling around.

"The ancient tale of the frog and the mouse in a strange wedding ballad dates back to the 16th century. It tells of a crow watching a tailor, a shot gone awry hitting a pig, and a comforting lullaby sung to a child. Lullabies, across ages and cultures, share a similar structure: a call for rest, mention of a father away working, and a promise of his return with gifts. These soothing songs have stood the test of time, with variations in different lands. Even the oldest tunes like ""Katherine Beardie"" from the early 17th century continue to captivate with their timeless melodies. Such songs offer solace and hope, unlike the somber tones of others that hint at emptiness.

Children's prayers can be quite amusing and honest. A girl prayed for her family but didn't want her sister to bake bread. Another boy, tired of praying for everyone, wished they could pray for themselves. A child, learning about Heaven after her brother's death, refused to go, wanting to stay with her family. A boy wanted to be an engine-driver, not an angel. A girl, asked what she'd do if her mother died, said they'd cry, bury her, and take money from her pocket. Children are straightforward and sometimes surprising. In another story, a girl thought her mother was the only one who knew how to care for newborn twins.

"It is fascinating to share a story that reveals how children from royal families and common families share similar curiosities and behaviors.

Children, according to Ruskin, are like birds forced by nature to invent and create. As they grow, their imaginative abilities soar. Around ten or twelve years old, when their own ideas start to dwindle, they turn to adventure books. Before that age, their make-believe adventures are unmatched. For example, two boys spent a snowy Christmas day tiger-hunting in their father's dining room. Another story tells of children putting on a play without adult interference, showcasing the creativity and independence of young minds. Even in simple activities like building a mud church by the roadside, children's creativity shines through.

Another tale tells of a boy who threatened to reveal his pants were made from old curtains unless he got what he wanted.

One evening, a young boy, accompanied by his mother, marveled at the dark sky, noticing the absence of stars. He innocently remarked that God must have been busy, forgetting to hang the stars. A witty girl attending church alone showed her humor when choosing a seat by the organ, hoping to see a monkey nearby. Another child, sent to post a letter, proudly admitted slipping it in without paying. Two girls from London joyfully recounted their day in the country, mentioning witnessing the slaughter of pigs and a gentleman's burial. A city girl was surprised by a schoolmate who confidently recited about a sow and her pigs but had never seen one. The encounter of a crossing-sweeper with Miss Dorothy Tennant, who later met Mr. Gladstone, left a lasting impression.

"During a recent school examination in Scotland, a girl was asked to explain the phrase ""He was amply rewarded."" Her quick response was, ""Paid for it."" The examiner challenged her with a scenario of buying bread, but she confidently said she had amply rewarded the baker by paying more.

Another boy thought his father's debt to a tailor for clothes paid in shillings equaled the total cost, showing a unique perspective. In another instance, a boy drew a bird on a slate and claimed he did it himself, humorously responding, ""Oh, I'm fine,"" causing confusion due to the Scottish dialect.

Once upon a time, a giant committed a terrible crime by stabbing Jack's father, leaving his mother and him in grave danger. Fleeing from the giant, Jack's mother settled in a small cottage far away, keeping Jack safe and hidden from the giant's wrath. A fairy, who had transgressed and lost her powers, watched over Jack from afar. When Jack encountered the giant's wife and sought refuge in their house, he discovered the giant's horrifying plans to feast on human flesh.

Once upon a time, Jack outsmarted a giant and stole a magical hen. He lived happily with his mother until he felt the urge to seek revenge on the giant.

Once the giant had finished counting the gold, he secured it even more tightly than the silver. Exhausted, he fell asleep in his chair by the fireside, snoring as loudly as the roaring sea during a high wind. Jack, certain the giant was asleep, attempted to take the money bags. However, a little dog suddenly appeared and barked furiously at Jack. Remembering the bones from supper, Jack tossed one to the dog, distracting it. Jack seized the bags and fled, reaching the bean-stalk and descending safely. Finding his mother unwell, Jack was distraught. After his mother recovered, Jack gave her the bags, and they lived happily. Despite the comfort, Jack's mind lingered on the bean-stalk due to the fairy's warnings. Eventually, Jack's curiosity led him back up the bean-stalk, where he encountered the giant's wife and managed to steal a magical harp.
