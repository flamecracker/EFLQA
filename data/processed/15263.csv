Millions of my ancestors were slaves, but my parents sought freedom. My father worked hard to buy his freedom, while my mother fled with us, her children, to a free state. Life began anew, but slave-hunters soon found us. Despite being captured and returned to slavery, my mother never gave up hope. After years of separation, one of my brothers miraculously found us in Philadelphia. This reunion inspired me to document our family's struggles during slavery.

"During the time when abolitionists fought for freedom before the rebellion, fugitives played a crucial role in inspiring and supporting the cause. The Underground Railroad served as a powerful symbol of the desire for freedom among the four million slaves. Their steps towards liberation, education, and advocacy echoed loudly, providing a strong argument for emancipation. Even today, free colored individuals must continue to demonstrate the ability of their race to overcome obstacles like oppression and poverty. By acquiring knowledge, showing moral character, promoting economic initiatives, and proving themselves capable, they pave the way for political progress. This underscores the importance of sharing stories like those found in the ""Underground Railroad Letters,"" which shed light on the bravery and sacrifices made by individuals like Seth Concklin in the pursuit of freedom."|"['1.

One day, Seth stumbled upon the story of Peter Still in a newspaper. Peter, kidnapped as a child, spent forty years yearning for freedom and his family. Determined, he saved money to buy himself and search for his loved ones. Seth, moved by Peter's plight, volunteered to rescue his wife and children from slavery. Despite the danger, Seth was willing to risk his life for strangers. Peter hesitated at first, fearing failure. The plan was kept secret, known only to a few.

Peter suggested to Vina that she give him a cape and other small items as symbols. If Concklin or someone else came to take them, Peter would send back the cape as a sign that everything was okay. He returned to Philadelphia and accepted Concklin's offer. Peter described his family and their freedom plans to Seth. Concklin was deeply moved by the meeting and was ready to start the risky mission. He left without saying goodbye to his sisters, knowing they wouldn't agree. He took minimal supplies and kept Vina's cape hidden. He planned to act as a slaveholder to help the family escape to Cincinnati but faced delays. Despite challenges, he traveled thousands of miles by water and foot, rowing for days to rescue the family.

"William remained calm; he dismissed the boys promptly. He was instantly friendly. Peter and Levin were on the Island, accompanied by one of the young masters. It was not safe to meet them until Saturday night when they would be home. A location was set to see Vina in an open field that night; they were to bring food. Our meeting lasted only four minutes, and then I left. It was dark and cloudy when William appeared at ten o'clock. We exchanged signals, and he guided me to where Vina was standing. Our meeting lasted ten minutes. She didn't address me as ""master"" or ""sir,"" showing her trust in me. To ensure safety, we planned to meet Peter and Levin at the riverbank at dawn on Sunday to establish laws. During our meeting, William knelt with his face to the ground, watching for wolves. I had no safe place to stay, so I roamed until morning, eating the hoe cake William had given me. The next day, I searched for work. I pondered the contrast between William, a Christian preacher, and those in Pennsylvania. As I waited for Sunday morning, I surveyed the river's surroundings from Florence to plan my departure. I attracted attention as a stranger. I stayed at various places, including a medical gentleman's and an ex-magistrate's house. The ex-magistrate shared that many people can't read or write, despite reports. I had to spend Saturday night outside to meet Peter"|"['1.

I met Peter and Levin by the riverbank, two miles from the plantation. I didn't mention being from Philadelphia or talk about certain subjects. I will need to be cautious when I reach a free State in March with my crew. I must be wise and careful. I feel like I'm being watched, so I can't keep this letter. I might write again from Cincinnati. Florence is where I departed, and it's the head of navigation. I found the place as Peter described, except for the river's distance. South Florence has white families, warehouses, but no school. McKiernon is with me, waiting for a steamboat to New Orleans. My plan is to go to Canada via the Wabash, opposite Detroit. There are different routes, and I chose this one due to risks on the Ohio River. I will travel by skiff, a safer option. When I reach the Wabash, I will follow a specific path to Canada. David Stormon will assist us on our journey. Expenses are estimated at forty dollars, and I may need additional funds for protection. If you can help, please send fifty dollars to Princeton, Gibson County, Indiana.|['1.

Not having a letter of introduction to Stormon that I could trust, I journeyed around two hundred miles to test his reliability. I encountered many Abolitionists, most making offers they wouldn't follow through on. I've traveled over three thousand miles, mostly by steamboat and railroad. I have five hundred miles left to reach the plantation for work. I've faced challenges like getting wet and having no money. The route to Stormon's is considered safe. Concklin's thrilling letter narrated his dangerous journey to Indiana with Peter's family. Despite perilous encounters, their hope for freedom in Canada grew stronger.

We sent messages to different places to gather information, but we couldn't find anything. The latest details were in yesterday's _Times_, but they were incorrect. Enclosed is the article. I fear the hope for the slaves' freedom is lost. If the latest news is accurate, there's a chance Concklin might escape the cruel oppressors. I can't express how sad I feel upon hearing this news. I'm ashamed of my country. What can I even say? I believe a just God will seek justice for the oppressed. WM.

Concklin left his belongings with me, except a few shirts. If we don't hear from him soon, we might think he's lost and his escape was a lie. Despite the grim situation, Peter remained determined to save his family. However, it was hard to contact anyone in Alabama due to their ties to slavery.

"Dear Sir,

I must express that raising the amount you ask for the family is beyond our means. Peter has authorized me to offer twenty-five hundred, but gathering such a sum from the public is challenging. In the North, requests for aid are frequent, and many are fatigued by these appeals. While some of us own property, it is not substantial enough to bear this burden. Mother has a small farm in New Jersey, sustaining her in old age. My brothers have modest holdings, supporting their young families. I work as a clerk, but my salary limits my contribution. We lack wealth but have friends. I appeal to your humanity. Could you reduce the price or release them without charge? Your decision holds their happiness. Please consider our situation.

A woman named Charity, who had great faith in God, found comfort in singing Methodist tunes day and night.

They come from New Chestertown, within five miles of the place from which the nine lately forwarded came, and left behind them a colored woman who knew of their intended flight and of their intention of passing through Wilmington and leaving their horses and carriages there. I have been thus particular in my statement, because the case seems to us one of unusual danger. We have separated the company for the present, sending a mother and five children, two of them quite small, in one direction, and a husband and wife and three lads in another until I could write to you and get advice if you have any to give as to the best method of forwarding them and assistance pecuniarily in getting them to Canada. The mother and children we have sent off the usual route and to a place where I do not think they can remain many days. The person who took the husband and wife and three lads to E.F. Pennypecker and Peart has returned and reports that L. Peart sent three on to Norristown. We fear that there they will fall into the hands of an ignorant colored man Daniel Ross and that he may not understand the necessity of caution. Will you please write to some careful person there?

"Dear Mr. Still,

I am pleased to reconnect with you and hope this message finds you and your family in good health. I am as determined as ever to continue our work for the cause.

We were surprised by the arrival of these goods that we did not expect. The reason for our excitement is that a large box was sent to us by J. Bustill from Harrisburg about three weeks ago. We received the box and then forwarded it to J. Jones in Elmira. The next day, they were searching for the box eagerly, and it reached Elmira safely. I have received a letter from Jones confirming that all is well. The enclosed slip contains the marks of one of the packages, which you should read and then destroy immediately. It was remarkable how this was achieved during a time of high alertness here. Can you explain how and through whom this was accomplished? It is important for me to know, not out of mere curiosity, but for the benefit of others. The memory of Concklin, who displayed selfless dedication, will always be treasured by me.

Jane is described as tall and well-formed, with a high forehead and chestnut hair. She appears to have uncommon good sense, although she has never been allowed to read. The five colored porters who helped Jane and her children are praised for their sympathy and noble actions. Despite facing oppression, these individuals acted admirably in assisting Jane and her boys. The mystery surrounding Jane's whereabouts after leaving the wharf was not revealed. Mr. Williamson, who was involved in the situation, left for Harrisburg for business, leaving the Anti-Slavery Office to handle the situation. The court postponed further action, and when Mr. Williamson returned, he cooperated with the legal proceedings. Despite facing imprisonment, Mr. Williamson stood by his principles, gaining admiration and sympathy for his dedication to freedom. The pro-slavery elements in Philadelphia attempted to silence those advocating for freedom, but their efforts backfired as sympathy for the cause grew. Mr. Williamson's imprisonment inadvertently fueled the fight for liberty, drawing attention to the injustices of slavery.|"['1.

Many men, women, and children were safely transported to Canada despite challenges. These brave individuals, driven by their belief in liberty and God's command to help the oppressed, risked their lives without expecting any reward. One letter mentions the safe arrival of 17 or 27 individuals from a group of escaped slaves, with one boy missing. Another letter warns of a possible traitor in Philadelphia who might betray escaped slaves. Yet, there were still trustworthy allies like Friend Augusta, a dedicated Underground Railroad agent. Another letter details the arrival of a family of six adults and five children seeking refuge. The Committee promptly arranged for their safe passage to Elmira and Philadelphia. These stories highlight the courage and sacrifices made to help those seeking freedom.|"[""1.

Miss Lewis initially considered sending only a portion of her runaway guests to the Philadelphia Committee. However, upon further reflection, she decided to ensure all of them were safely transported in due time. The Committee made great efforts to provide them with as much comfort as possible, especially since the cases of these mothers and children evoked deep sympathy. It is important to mention the sufferings of Captain Lee, who was wrongly convicted for helping four individuals escape. Despite being torn from his family and sentenced to 25 years in the Richmond Penitentiary, he endured severe punishments before passing away. The Committee learned that Lee's conviction was based on coerced testimony obtained through violence, which should not have been admissible in court. The story also highlights the benevolence of individuals like Mr. Wm. Ingram, who cared for Lee's children and their mother.|"[""1.

The lady faced a challenge when trying to sell a sick woman, but she cleverly bundled her with a little boy, making the pair more appealing to buyers. Despite the sale, the lady showed no kindness towards her servants, including Cordelia.

In late December of 1857, brothers Isaac and Edmondson managed to escape from Petersburg, Virginia. Their mistress, Mrs. Ann Colley, a widow, had planned to sell them on January 1st. Mrs. Colley had only a few slaves, including the brothers. Jackson, another brother, had escaped earlier in May and was described as a runaway slave. He had a free wife up North who kept him inspired to seek freedom. The Vigilance Committee helped Jackson. Isaac and Edmondson followed their brother's path and reached Philadelphia with the Committee's aid. Their father, who had lost his sight, was overjoyed to reunite with his sons. The emotional reunion brought tears of joy. The records described Isaac as a healthy, intelligent man who was to be sold soon. Mrs. Colley must have been disappointed to find them missing.|"['1.

"Edmondson, a young man owned by Mrs. Colley and brother of Isaac, was around twenty-five years old.

The Committee's advice was well-received, and many travelers wrote back to confirm this.

"Dear Mr. William Still,

I hope this letter finds you well. I received your letters and papers with gratitude. The words written to slaveholders are powerful, coming from someone who has suffered under slavery. I felt compelled to share them to raise awareness and speak out against oppression.

Times are dull here, but we are all well. I deeply regret the recent excitement surrounding the issue of slavery. Please keep me updated on any developments. Your kindness is greatly appreciated, and I hope to reciprocate it someday.

The impending judgments foreseen in the ""Warning"" have come to pass, and slavery has been abolished. Despite his hardships, the old blind father of Jackson, Isaac, and Edmondson still lives to witness this freedom.

In the face of desperation, brave slaves like Robert Brown, also known as Thomas Jones, sought new ways to escape. Robert's daring escape from Martinsburg, Va., in 1856, where he swam the Potomac River on horseback on a cold Christmas night, stands as a testament to the relentless pursuit of freedom. Robert's courage and sacrifice for liberty are truly remarkable.

After receiving help from the Vigilance Committee and recovering from their journey, they were sent to the Vigilance Committee in New York. In Syracuse, Frank, engaged to Emily, decided to marry her on the U.G.R.R. without delay. Emily's bravery and struggles during the journey added to her charm. They were married in Syracuse by Rev.

Frank Wanzer, a courageous hero, undertook a perilous journey of nearly a thousand miles through enemy territory to rescue several individuals from slavery. Among those rescued were Robert Stewart, Vincent Smith, and Betsey Smith. Robert, a man of thirty years, was owned by the widow Hutchinson, who had about a hundred other slaves.

The governor and his wife were both very strict with the slaves, limiting their clothing and food. The governor would often inspect the plantation operations. William was separated from his wife by being sold to serve the governor. The promise of visits to his wife was broken, leading William to escape. He endured hardships in caves and swamps for ten months. Despite facing dangers from animals, he preferred it to living under the governor's rule.

It is unfortunate that due to circumstances, the stories of these individuals were not fully saved. If their tales were properly recorded, they would likely be among the most captivating stories of escape in history. In 1857, when these remarkable travelers came to the attention of the Vigilance Committee, there was little anticipation of the historical significance their stories would hold. Care was not always taken to document them as slavery was expected to persist, and the records were not deemed valuable then. The narratives were so numerous and compelling that it was challenging to do them justice. The attention paid to the stories by friends was so engrossing that little time was left to record them. The heroes, Joseph Grant and John Speaks, faced tremendous trials before their escape.

In Toronto, Canada West, a man named Solomon managed to secure a private berth on the steamship City of Richmond to escape slavery. He left behind his mistress, Mary A. Ely, in Norfolk. Solomon, a young man of dark complexion and natural ability, viewed slavery as a hardship. He had been hiring his time from his mistress but feared being sold to North Carolina. This prompted his escape to Canada. Seven days after reaching Canada, he wrote a letter to Mr. Still expressing his gratitude for reaching a land of freedom.

"Dear William Still,

I received your letter for John Smith. He asks that you contact Thomas Cook, his friend in Baltimore, through the care of Mr. Thomas Spicer at the Baltimore post office. Smith is working near St. Catharines, 12 miles from Niagara Falls. He wants Cook to visit his wife and tell her he's well and doing fine. Smith's wife is near their previous place, and Cook knows about her situation. Ann Johnson and Lavina Woolfley, who fled from Maryland in 1857, deserve recognition for their bravery. Ann, a former slave, worked for Samuel Harrington and then William Moore. Lavina, married to James Woolfley, was separated from him but received news of his safety in Canada.

Upon reflection, the doctor remembered an old acquaintance, a farmer and his family who were slave-owners in Maryland. He decided to visit them at the end of his journey. The farmer warmly welcomed the doctor, who reciprocated the gesture. The doctor, well-versed in various topics, engaged in conversation with the farmer about farming and other matters. He also provided guidance to Joe, the waiter boy, on how to conduct himself. As the evening progressed, the doctor mentioned feeling unwell and retired early, with Joe sleeping in the same room. The next morning, the doctor and Joe continued their journey towards Pennsylvania.

One of the most heartwarming aspects of the stories of escaped slaves is the enduring love and loyalty they showed towards their family members still enslaved in the South. Their unwavering faith in God was evident in their heartfelt pleas for their fellow slaves. Even after decades had passed, the deep bond and care for their loved ones remained steadfast. The separation from children and the sight of innocent individuals suffering at the hands of cruel owners haunted them. John Henry, a former slave, never forgot his companions in bondage. He wrote passionately in support of those seeking freedom, believing firmly in God's support for the oppressed. Despite his lack of formal education due to the restrictions placed on slaves, his letters reflected a deep longing for liberty and a fierce determination to fight against injustice. John's escape from the auction block marked the end of his life as a slave, but his journey to freedom was filled with challenges and risks.|"['1.

My dear friend, I am delighted to inform you that my wife and children have safely arrived in this city. Unfortunately, my wife faced some misfortune as she lost $35, which included money for the children. She had to travel to Niagara Falls and telegraphed me to come after her. Despite the challenges, we finally reunited after a long absence, bringing us immense joy. My wife is content here, and she enjoyed her time in your city. The trip to the falls cost me $10.87, and the items shipped by friend Brown amounted to $24.25. While setting up our new home here has depleted my funds, I am grateful for my freedom. The weather is cold, with snowfall, but people are still out from 10 AM to 12 PM, engaging in various activities.

After being concealed for three years, James finally found a way to escape. He was under twenty-one years old when he decided to fight for his freedom in Richmond. For three years, he resisted the slave Power with unwavering courage in the city. Such brave acts of defiance against slavery inspired others around the world. His heroism, though not extensively documented, was known to the Committee. A letter from a friend who helped hide him sheds light on his condition before his escape. James eventually made it to Philadelphia on the steamship Pennsylvania, surprising the Vigilance Committee who had almost lost hope of his arrival.

In 1853, a passenger arrived in Philadelphia from Norfolk, Virginia. This man, named Archer, had been under the control of Dr. George Wilson for four years before deciding to escape. Archer felt mistreated by the doctor, who allowed him to hire his time for $120 a year but did not reduce the amount when he was sick. This unfair treatment led Archer to seek freedom. He was a man of mixed race, a dark mulatto, and at the age of thirty-one, he made the brave decision to escape slavery. With the help of the Vigilance Committee, Archer found his way to Boston and became a citizen there. Another man, Samuel, also fled from Virginia in 1853 due to similar mistreatment. He realized the value of money as a means to freedom and saved every dollar until he could escape. Samuel, along with two others, sought refuge in New Jersey but soon faced the threat of capture by slave-hunters. The Committee aided them in reaching Canada, emphasizing the importance of not stopping until they reached safety.|"[""1.

A traveler arrived from Millsboro, Indian River, Delaware, where he was owned by Wm. E. Burton. Hansel, though not really owning himself, had the reputation of having a wife and six children. In June, six months before his arrival, his wife had been allowed by her mistress to go out on a begging expedition to buy herself but never returned. The mistress likely saw this as highhanded stealing. Hansel, fearing his master was about to sell him, decided to pursue his wife to a Free state, unsure of where to look. His wife, Rose Anna, fled from Isaac Tonnell of Georgetown, Delaware, in Christmas week, 1853, with her two children. They made their way to West Chester, found friends, and eventually reached Philadelphia. The mother, in her thirties, with two promising young daughters, escaped due to the threat of her children being sold. Her escape was a beacon of hope in the dark world of slavery.|"[""1.

A man or woman fleeing for freedom, carrying belongings or holding a child, was always a remarkable sight that should be remembered. The descriptions provided by slave owners often showed great artistic skill and detailed knowledge of their enslaved individuals. These descriptions were so vivid that the Committee preferred using them rather than creating new ones. While some ads were open to criticism, they served their practical purpose well. For instance, one ad described Isaac as very light-skinned with no noticeable marks, which was a common tactic for slaves seeking escape. The owners, like Mr. Dade and Mr. Owings, showed generosity in their rewards, reflecting a sense of southern chivalry. The fugitives, such as Sam and Isaac, displayed courage and determination to reach Philadelphia and eventually Canada for freedom. Their stories, shared by the Committee, shed light on the harsh realities of slavery and the resilience of those seeking liberation.|['1.

Susan, a woman who had suffered greatly since her husband's death, found herself in a desperate situation. Fearing that her failing health might lead to being undervalued by traders, she decided to escape to Canada. With her son already there, she felt a strong connection to the land. Enduring months of bondage, she finally received word that her escape was imminent. Using a clever method to avoid suspicion, she made her way to the boat that would take her to freedom via the Underground Railroad. Susan's story of hardships and bravery was compelling, but there were others waiting to share their tales. With her escape in 1854, Susan left behind a sister eager to follow. Meanwhile, Henry, facing the prospect of finding a new master, feigned illness to buy time for his escape. With his wife Eliza in mind, he made the bold decision to seek freedom in Canada, leaving behind the Baptist Minister's ownership.

Arrival No. 2 reached the Committee with a colored man, a white woman, and a ten-year-old child. This was a surprising case because the party was unique. The colored man named David was around twenty-seven years old, intelligent, and felt he could not adapt to a life of servitude. He decided to travel disguised as a coachman under the protection of the white lady. They borrowed a carriage from David's master and set off towards Pennsylvania. When they reached Chambersburg, they stayed at a hotel where they were suspected of being part of the Underground Rail Road movement. To avoid trouble, they left the horse and carriage and took regular passenger cars to Philadelphia.

In a challenging time, William Robinson, also known as Thomas Harred, faced the difficult decision to leave his wife and three children. Thankfully, they were free. The Committee generously assisted him and helped him move to Canada. Upon his safe arrival, William expressed gratitude in a letter.

In July 1853, a man named Sam, aged about twenty-five and a blacksmith by trade, ran away from Macon to Savannah seeking freedom. Despite lacking formal education, he had learned to read and write while enslaved. His intelligence stood out among other slaves. Sam's escape led him to hide in a stable until boarding the Keystone State ship secretly. Authorities in Newcastle, Delaware, detained him, suspecting him of being a runaway slave. Despite being proved free, a claimant from Georgia sought to re-enslave him. The local authorities resisted, and a trial was anticipated.

However, his escape stirred animosity towards his family, particularly his father, an esteemed local preacher.

"The trial of Sam Green, a free black man, for possessing materials that could incite discontent among people of color, took place recently. Evidence revealed that Green's son in Canada received aid from him, leading to suspicions of aiding runaway slaves. Search of Green's house uncovered incriminating items like ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" and a map of Canada. Despite strong evidence, the court found the law inapplicable and declared Green not guilty. However, a separate indictment for possessing ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" is pending. Green's son in Canada sought help for his father's plight, imprisoned for ten years. While some sympathized, they were powerless to assist. Eventually, Green was freed, sharing tales of suffering and divine support post-release. In contrast, John Hall's story, a former slave, tells of seeking liberty due to mistreatment and lack of choice under different owners.

When I last saw you, I mentioned my plan to go to Liberia, but upon observing the situation of colored people in Canada, I decided to work towards uplifting them as a community. I took the initiative to form a military company among them, despite initial skepticism. Major J.T. Gilepon supported my idea and advised me to proceed. With Mr. J.H.

Inspectors have a crucial role in ensuring vessels comply with the law. If no issues are found during inspection, the captain receives a certificate. However, if a slave, person held for labor, or someone accused of a crime is discovered on board, the vessel is detained, and all individuals are handed over to the authorities. Inspectors can call for assistance if faced with opposition. They are entitled to a fee for each inspection, ensuring compliance. Any inspector aiding in capturing escaping slaves may receive a reward. Violations can result in fines. The establishment of police patrols and the appointment of inspectors in specific regions further enforce the law.

He arrived in this country safely, except for a close call in Albany where he almost got caught and sent back. When he reached the suspension bridge, he was relieved and ran towards freedom. He arrived at the end of October and is now looking for work for the winter. He worked chopping wood until February. Money is scarce, but he is doing well. He misses the girl he left behind, Rachel, and thinks there is no one like her here. Please respond soon. Yours truly. Pete had a tough life until he was thirty-five, under William S.

John, a prisoner of hope under James Ray in Portsmouth, Va., escaped the harsh life he endured. Despite being a dark mulatto of thirty-one years, he was well-formed and intelligent. Hiring his time for $120 annually, he toiled daily to support his brutal master. John suffered abuse and feared being sold at an auction. Fleeing to Canada, he left his wife behind. Some slaves who hired their time bought nice clothes, treasured them, and sought ways to secure them after escaping. The Committee assisted John, who found happiness and work in Canada but longed for his wife and clothing. John sent messages requesting his clothes and his wife to be sent to him.

Harriet Shephard, a mother of five, could not bear the idea of her children enduring the chains of slavery as she had. Despite never experiencing kindness, she escaped not for herself but to save her young ones from the same fate. With no money or means to travel, she courageously took her master's horses and carriages to reach Wilmington, Delaware. There, they were swiftly directed to Thomas Garrett, a key figure in the Underground Railroad. Urgently, they were separated from the vehicles and whisked off to Kennett Square for safety. From there, they were discreetly guided to Philadelphia, disguised and divided for protection, before being sent to Canada. Meanwhile, Washington Somlor, escaping brutal treatment by his owner Smith, found refuge via the steamer Pennsylvania from Norfolk.

The treatment Arthur faced was incredibly harsh and hard to believe at first. The Committee was initially skeptical until presented with undeniable facts. His first attempt to escape was on the steamship City of Richmond, but due to ice in the river, the ship had to turn back near Philadelphia. Despite the disappointment, Washington persevered. After being safely escorted off the boat upon its return to Norfolk, he patiently waited for spring in his dismal hiding place. When the opportunity for another escape arose, he seized it without hesitation. This time, his faith paid off, and he successfully reached Philadelphia, inspiring all who heard his story. Arthur, a man of about thirty, dark complexion, and medium build, had endured mistreatment under his former master in Spring Hill, Maryland. Concerned about his future under the master's heirs, he bravely sought freedom through the Underground Railroad, facing challenges but remaining hopeful for a better life in Canada.|"[""1.

John, a man of mixed race, was well-dressed and appeared well-fed. He was owned by Miss Eliza Lambert, who allowed him to hire his time for a yearly fee.

The Committee was impressed by James' eloquence, intelligence, and passion against the oppressive system. Matthew, a determined and stout man, had grievances against Samuel Simmons for claiming ownership over him. Despite the ill-treatment, the group found immense joy in their successful journey on the Underground Railroad towards freedom in Canada. Advised to seek education and act as free men, they reached Toronto safely. James Monroe, Peter Heines, Henry James Morris, and Matthew Bodame shared their well-being in Toronto, expressing gratitude.

"To Mr. Still, Dear Sir,

I am writing on behalf of a young man named James Morris, who passed through your care in July of 1856. His wife, Lucy Morris, and their child, Lot Morris, are in danger of being sold in Virginia. James is eager for them to escape, and he has saved forty dollars to help bring them to Toronto, Canada West. Please direct any correspondence to Mrs. Ringgold in Toronto, as I will be out of town.

It is unknown if James was successful in reuniting with his family. Many fugitives in Canada, mostly single young men, found Irish partners and married. There are likely white women in Canada today who married fugitive husbands of slave women.

Perry Shephard, Isaac Reed, George Sperryman, Valentine Spires, Daniel Green, James Johnson, Henry Cooper, William Israel Smith, and Anna Dorsey are among those who sought freedom from various locations, enduring hardships for the hope of liberty.

Thank you for your attention,

James Johnson was a sturdy man who worked as a slave for Thomas Wallace in Maryland. At thirty-five, he managed to escape, bringing his younger wife, Harriet, with him. Harriet, previously owned by William T. Wood, feared being sold due to Wood's drinking habits. Charles Henry Cooper and William Israel Smith, representing Middletown, Delaware, decided to escape slavery after contemplating the injustice of working without pay. They were in their early twenties and embarked on the Underground Railroad, leaving loved ones behind. Anna Dorset, a twenty-two-year-old seamstress, tired of slavery under Eli Molesworth in Maryland. Owen Taylor, his wife Mary Ann, and their son Edward, along with family members, escaped from Clear Springs, Maryland, through Harrisburg to Philadelphia. The determined brothers vowed never to surrender alive, seeking freedom for their families.

Owen, a skilled mechanic, worked for Henry Fiery, a farmer who owned Owen and his brothers. They, along with their families, planned an escape.

Mr. Jones may not know which way his man Tom went, but this note can tell him that Tom's name was recorded on the Underground Rail Road book on April 4th, 1856. Tom seemed healthy and hopeful for a safe journey to Canada, despite being destitute after being robbed of all his earnings. On the same day, James Jones arrived, owned by Dr. William Stewart but dissatisfied with his situation. James, now Henry Rider, sought freedom in Canada and left Maryland. The Committee welcomed James warmly. The women outnumbered the men among the group that arrived, with two young mothers and their children. The mothers had heroically rescued their daughters from a fate of being sold as slaves. Rebecca Jones and her children faced a reward for their capture, but they were determined to escape slavery at any cost.|"[""1.

Despite the peril they faced, the women and children who sought refuge were not turned away empty-handed. They were fed, clothed, and comforted before being sent off to safety. The generosity extended to them was so abundant that as they were escorted to the train station, they resembled a group out for leisure rather than fleeing individuals. Good-hearted friends of the enslaved individuals provided clothing and support, lifting their spirits during a challenging time.

The notion of young boys being left to fend for themselves in the world sparked deep reflection. The Committee was pleased that they were starting early to break free from the horrors of slavery. They made sure to guide the boys on the right path, offering advice and assistance before sending them off. The fate of these boys remains unknown. Henry Hooper, a nineteen-year-old from Maryland, arrived in December through the Underground Railroad. Jacob Hall, also known as Henry Thomas, along with his wife Henrietta and child, decided to escape to Canada due to the harsh conditions of slavery.

Around the same period, a young woman named Mary Curtis arrived, claiming she was from Baltimore and had fled to avoid being sold. She was nineteen years old, small in stature, and had a dark complexion. William Brown followed her. Unlike others who escaped with less trouble, William faced extreme hardships during his five-week journey. He endured severe suffering while fleeing from oppression, determined not to return to his master, who had previously punished him for resisting a flogging. William eventually succeeded in his escape, finding unspeakable joy in his triumph. Charles Henry Brown, owned by Dr. Richard Dorsey of Cambridge, Maryland, was against slavery from a young age. He reasoned that taking a man's hard-earned wages year after year was worse than robbing him. Oliver Purnell and Isaac Fidget, from Berlin, Maryland, also arrived, each with different owners. Oliver sought freedom to earn his own wages and rejected pro-slavery teachings, despite growing up surrounded by them.|"['1.

Isaac, a man of about thirty years, was traveling with his companion. He hoped to reunite with his wife, who had escaped the previous Spring. However, he had no idea where she was since her departure. A lady named Mrs. Fidget held the deed for Isaac. He spoke well of her, believing she treated her slaves better than most slaveholders in his area. As we read about the struggles of slaves for freedom, it's hard to imagine the atrocities they faced in the 19th century under a supposedly enlightened government. The Fugitive Slave Bill, enacted by the U.S. Congress, allowed for the capture and return of escaped slaves. Any person obstructing this process could face fines and imprisonment. The bill aimed to maintain the institution of slavery and punish those who helped slaves escape.|"[""1.

During the time of the Fugitive Slave Bill, a law was enacted to capture escaped slaves and return them to their owners. This caused a lot of unrest and tension between those who supported slavery and those who opposed it. In an incident at Christiana, Pennsylvania, a group of slave hunters attempted to capture seven escaped slaves. However, the local community, armed and determined to defend their freedom, stood up against the slave hunters. A battle ensued, with shots fired, but no one was injured. The brave actions of the community members in Christiana show their strong will to resist unjust laws and fight for their rights.

About an hour to an hour and a half passed in heated discussions and threats; the number of black individuals grew to around thirty to fifty, many armed. Castner Hanaway and Elijah Lewis, respected citizens, arrived. The deputy marshal, Kline, demanded their help in capturing the escaped slaves, but they refused and warned against violence. Kline retreated, and tensions escalated. The situation nearly turned violent, but Hanaway and Lewis intervened to prevent bloodshed. Despite their efforts, shots were fired, leading to a confrontation where Gorsuch and his son were injured. The slave-hunters fled, and neighbors, including abolitionists, tended to the wounded.

The enemies of the colored people are causing fresh harm and spreading lies about the abolitionists. Even though most colored individuals were not involved, they are being chased and captured unjustly. Castner Hanaway and Elijah Lewis turned themselves in, believing in their innocence. The situation escalated with an overwhelming presence of law enforcement and military personnel searching for suspects. Innocent families faced terror as their homes were raided. The public opinion was harsh against the abolitionists, accusing them of instigating the violence. The newspapers condemned the events at Christiana, labeling them as insurrection and treason.

"Treason is a serious crime against the United States, defined in the Constitution as ""levying war against them, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."" This definition includes both a combination to oppose the law by force and the actual use of force. The act of treason involves a conspiracy to resist the law through violent means. Even if not directly involved in the violence, those who plan, support, or instigate it are considered guilty. Treason does not have accessories; anyone involved in planning or encouraging the act is equally responsible. It is crucial to uphold the constitution and its laws as the foundation of our nation.

It should not be assumed that the views expressed represent the sentiment of Pennsylvania. To include them in the same category of personal, social, or political morals would be unjust to our people. The constitution states that 'no person shall be convicted of treason without two witnesses or a confession in open court.' This requirement pertains to the trial, not the preliminary hearing or grand jury proceedings. Chief Justice Marshall held the opinion that no conviction can occur until after arraignment on a bill found. Treason against the United States can be committed by any resident or sojourner within its territory, whether citizen or alien. Apart from treason, there are lesser offenses against the Constitution and the State, such as obstructing legal process or resisting service, as outlined in various acts of Congress. The Grand Jury must carefully inquire into any committed offenses, determine their legal nature, identify the offenders, and present their findings based on evidence and the law. The Grand Jury's duty is grave and momentous, requiring impartial judgment and adherence to the law in determining guilt and making presentments.|"['1.

Judge Kane's meticulously crafted charge led the Grand Jury to indict forty Christiana offenders for treason, including James Jackson, a Quaker and abolitionist. The indictment accused Jackson of plotting to disturb the peace by opposing laws regarding fugitive slaves. The Grand Inquest of the United States of America presented evidence that Jackson, with a group armed with weapons, intended to levy war against the United States. Despite opposition, acts of kindness were shown to the prisoners, such as a Thanksgiving dinner organized by Thomas L. Kane. The pro-slavery party protested the gesture, but it resonated as a symbol of support for freedom. Jackson's trial was a pivotal moment, with abolitionists and pro-slavery advocates clashing over the Fugitive Slave Law. The abolitionists, led by prominent lawyers, stood for freedom and justice, while the pro-slavery side relied on legal maneuvers and public sentiment.|"['1.

"After being imprisoned for almost three months, the time for the trial of the prisoners had finally arrived. The proceedings began on a Monday morning, November 24th.

A long time ago, two slaves, William and Ellen Craft, yearned for freedom in Georgia. They devised a daring plan. Ellen, fair enough to pass as white, would disguise as a young planter, with her hair cut and dressed in male attire. To overcome obstacles like Ellen's lack of a beard, they came up with clever solutions. William, a smart and attentive man, would act as her servant.

Upon reaching free soil, a miraculous transformation took place. Ailments vanished, the blind could see, the deaf could hear, and the lame could leap. Despite the joy, the journey had taken a toll on Ellen's nerves. Physically drained, she radiated delight. They sought refuge in Boston, where their freedom seemed secure. Welcomed by abolitionists, they were cheered without fear. However, the Fugitive Slave Law cast a shadow of uncertainty. Advised by Theodore Parker, they remarried legally. When slave hunters attempted their capture, Boston rallied against them. The city erupted in support of William and Ellen Craft.

In the forest, I dwelt with little and much. I had bread, corn, and potatoes. For seven months, I resided in a large poplar tree's hollow; the rest of the time, I dwelled in a cave. I endured severe cold and hunger. Once, I lit a fire in my tree with charcoal to warm up, but it almost harmed me, so I had to put it out. A snake tried to enter the tree, but I swiftly cut it in two with my axe. This snake was a poplar leaf moccasin, the most venomous in our area.

The arrival of an intriguing group was welcomed, but their departure likely displeased those benefitting from their unpaid work. Stockholders and conductors of the Underground Rail Road were pleased with its success, especially as business grew. Lewis, around fifty-two, tall with strong features and some Anglo-Saxon heritage, seemed suited to manage a farm in Canada. He shared about his past, owned by a man opposed to freedom for black individuals. Despite his loyal service, his hopes for freedom were dashed. After a series of disappointments, Lewis decided to flee to Canada, leaving behind his ungrateful owners.

Esteemed Friend William Still, I am celebrating my 69th birthday by sending you two fugitives, a man and his wife. The man has been waiting for his wife, who is expected to leave for your house at 9 this evening. There is some concern about the woman due to commotion in her neighborhood. Recently, four slaves were betrayed near the Maryland line by a man named Jesse Perry. The Rust boys, John and Elsey Bradley, were found after being sold and taken to Richmond, Virginia. Efforts are being made to prove their identity and freedom. Garrett provided more details about their escape. The two fugitives you were expecting have reached you. A.

The Underground Railroad was busy, with passengers seeking deliverance. Rebecca Jackson, a woman seeking freedom, made a bold move to escape bondage under Mrs. Margaret Dick. Frank, a man who had been mistreated, also sought freedom successfully.|"[""1.

Respected Friend William Still, I write to inform you that Harriet Tubman is back in our area. She arrived last evening from a merciful trip, bringing two men to New Castle. I have arranged for a guide to take them to Chester County, as one man's wife and children are still far away. Harriet has been entrusted with their safety, and I provided funds for their journey. There are risks on the road, but I trust in Harriet's protection. One of the men, Stephen, was a slave who could not live with his wife due to their owners. Harriet, like a modern-day Moses, is guiding them to freedom. Another woman in need joined their group, and they were supported with supplies and sent on their way to Canada. Due to the tense times after John Brown's capture, records were kept brief to avoid detection by pro-slavery forces. Let's pray for their safe journey. Warm regards, [Your Name]|"[""1.

I experienced some headaches on the journey but have been feeling better since. Please remind Julia Kelly that I accidentally took one of her pocket handkerchiefs, which I will keep as a memento. I must end this letter now as I have no more to say. Yours faithfully.

Cross-examined.--I haven't seen her since 1826 until I saw her in the court. I recognized her immediately without anyone pointing her out, and she recognized me too. I know her because she has a scar on her forehead similar to mine. We used to joke about our marks. She was known as Fanny Coates. I don't know anything about her husband. In 1826, she didn't do typical womanly tasks, she did dishes and scrubbed. She mentioned her parents were deceased and lived nearby. She lived with a family named Amos. The Judge asked to see the scars on both foreheads, which were similar. The scene caused a stir when the respondent's baby cried loudly. Mr. Brown responded to the plaintiff's counsel, highlighting the disparity in witness credibility. The respondent's witnesses were deemed more reliable, with stronger evidence supporting the respondent's claim. The plaintiff's counsel failed to discredit the respondent's witnesses effectively.|"['1.

We have presented witnesses solely on this matter and have effectively countered the opposing evidence. Not only have we proven she was a free woman, but we have also substantiated her status through additional evidence. What more does the gentleman have to add? Does he suggest we lack the right to make a judicial decision on this issue? Why is this case continually before you, consuming your time day by day? According to his argument, all you need to do is hand over the claimed individual to the master without question. However, it is essential to ensure the validity of these claims. We have entered with a substantial amount of evidence that dismantles his case, restoring the woman's rightful standing in the eyes of the law. Despite the comparison to a fugitive from justice, this analogy does not support his argument. The counsel must satisfy the judge with substantial evidence, which he has failed to do. Therefore, I urge Your Honor to release this woman after the extensive and irrefutable testimony we have presented. Mr. McMurtrie reiterated his points, emphasizing the gravity of the court's decision on the evidence required. Judge Kane emphasized the need for impartiality in enforcing the law, highlighting the complexities of establishing identity in such cases. The evidence presented by the claimant's witnesses was challenged by witnesses for the respondent, raising doubts about the claimant's assertions. Ultimately, the court found the evidence in favor of the respondent more convincing and ruled in her favor.|"[""1.

In a courtroom, a faint attempt at applause was quickly silenced. News of the woman's release spread outside, prompting shouts of joy. She and her children were rushed into a carriage, taken first to the Anti-slavery office, then to the Philadelphia Institute. There, a large audience of colored people greeted her with enthusiasm. Excited speeches were made, and the crowd showed great fervor both inside and outside the building. The woman was then taken home in a procession led by hundreds of men, women, and boys. They cheered wildly as they passed the counsel's residence before reaching the woman's home. This event, filled with exuberant joy, was a result of abolitionists' strategic efforts to save the woman from being separated from her children and forced back into slavery. The successful outcome was a cause for celebration among abolitionists, yet it was clear that the woman's release was a narrow escape.|"['1.

In Chester County, a region known for its Quaker settlers, a disturbing incident took place. A farmhouse was invaded by armed criminals while the able occupants were away, leaving only a colored man present. Despite his resistance, the man was brutally attacked and abducted. The neighbors, upon discovering the crime, pursued the kidnappers, but they had already fled. Another case of kidnapping was reported in West Cain Township, where an honest and hardworking man named Thomas Hall was taken from his home under false pretenses. His wife managed to escape and raise the alarm, but the perpetrators fled with him. These incidents shed light on the dangers faced by free individuals, and the urgent need for vigilance and protection against such crimes.|"['1.

In many cases, we are unable to offer aid. All we can do is pray and continue working towards freedom. The Fugitive Slave law, a cruel creation of this unjust system, inflicts unimaginable suffering. Picture a heartbroken mother learning her son is captured, a wife desperate to save her husband, and a husband pleading for his wife's freedom. Witness Hannah Dellam, a free woman fighting for her son's liberty, only to be torn from her family. These heart-wrenching scenes unfold daily. Families are shattered, and even in moments of respite, the pain lingers. A letter recounts the abduction of a young girl, a heinous act that demands justice.

The urgent need to rescue a kidnapped girl raises alarm. The invasion of their home by kidnappers is shocking. It suggests an inside informant due to the intruders' boldness. This case embodies the worst of human degradation, surpassing mere abstract discussions on slavery. The community rallied together, with generous abolitionists in Philadelphia providing crucial aid to destitute travelers seeking freedom. The unwavering support of anti-slavery societies and sewing circles in Philadelphia, alongside distant allies, was vital. Notable names like the Shipleys, Hoppers, and Parrishes stood out for their commitment to aiding slaves. Reverend N.R.

During a period of assistance and support from the Ladies' Anti-slavery Society of Ellington, a station conducted a thriving business.

The story of the persecuted Bereans from Kentucky is a tale of bravery and resilience. In the village of Berea, a small group of Christian men and women, known for their anti-slavery beliefs, were forced to flee their homes by armed Kentuckians. Despite having a flourishing school and a farm, they were given an ultimatum to leave the state within ten days. The exiles, including their pastors, had to quickly gather their belongings and seek refuge in Ohio. Among them was Elizabeth Rawlings, a young woman of remarkable courage and determination. She bravely continued the school in Berea after the others were driven away, standing firm in her anti-slavery and anti-caste principles. Despite facing adversity, she persevered in her mission to educate and inspire others. Their story is a testament to the strength of the human spirit in the face of injustice and oppression.|['1.

Dear friends, we have a heartfelt inquiry for you. Can we, in England, gather £50 or £60 for a year of schooling for two special girls, Elizabeth Rawlings and J.G. Fee's daughter? Elizabeth deserves it for her boldness, and the other as a tribute to her father. Imagine if these girls could become teachers in England, maintaining schools of high standards in their homeland. We've shared this with a few friends and already sent £8 to Mr. Fee for Elizabeth. Next, we have Cornelia Williams, Henry H. Garnet's niece, who was freed from slavery with help from friends. She's doing well in school in Nantucket. Frederick Douglass, a dear friend, had to return to the U.S. due to personal reasons but remains committed to the abolition cause. He trusts in God's plan and continues to fight for freedom.|"[""1.

Our friends may remember the cost of Frederick Douglass' paper is only five shillings a year, with an additional penny per month for postage. It's a fascinating publication that is well worth the small expense. Frederick Douglass hopes to increase his British readership and appreciates any support from this country to aid fugitives seeking refuge. Recently, nineteen Underground Railroad passengers sought shelter at his home, with most being able-bodied young men eager for freedom. One group, including two married couples and two single men, faced a perilous journey across the bay to escape pursuers. Despite a confrontation with white men, the fugitives showed immense courage and determination to secure their freedom. Ultimately, they found help from an oyster man who assisted them in reaching their destination, filled with hope for a brighter future.|[]|[]
In the past, secrecy was crucial when sharing information, as even friends could unintentionally harm the cause by exposing it. The pro-slavery sentiment was strong in cities like Philadelphia, posing threats to abolitionists and those aiding slaves. Thanks to generous donors, funds were sent to a writer, whose identity is kept confidential. Belonging to the oppressed race, like Douglass, these individuals work tirelessly for the well-being of the enslaved. Encouraged by inquiries on how to help slaves, even small donations can accumulate to provide significant aid. Contributions can be sent directly to the United States or through Newcastle. Supporting free labor produce over slave-produced goods is emphasized, as it uplifts free laborers and discourages the use of slave labor. Initiatives like Dr. M.R. Delany's efforts in West Africa and Stephen Bourne's cotton-growing company in Jamaica show promising steps towards eradicating slavery through free labor and mechanical advancements.|"['1.

Our dear friend Samuel Rhoads has been feeling very sad lately. I am sending this message through him, but I am hesitant to add more as I don't want to burden him further. Please convey our warm regards. Truly yours, Dear Friend William Still, it is a great idea to share these interesting messages with me. The letter you sent to your colleague in Elmira recently reached us. We must ensure that the depot there remains active if we can prevent it from shutting down. Perhaps J.W. Jones could be encouraged with a donation from England, specifically for the fugitives, to support the cause. If you agree, my friends would support this initiative, and you can decide whether to give him the donations all at once or in separate amounts. Most of the funds we have received have come from the generous donations inspired by your compelling letters. Our friends entrusted my husband and me with their money for the fugitives, allowing us to use it as we see fit. Lately, I have thought that sharing excerpts from your letters (along with other anti-slavery information) could help us secure more financial support. Currently, I can lend a private letter to a reliable friend, but if that letter were to get lost, it would be problematic. Additionally, making copies of letters is time-consuming, and my health doesn't permit me to engage in such sedentary work.

"Dear friend,

Enclosed is a contribution of five dollars for the fugitives, a small amount to share among many, but better than nothing. It is a wish that the wealthy would remember them instead of spending excessively on themselves. Even those who are not rich could give from their abundance if they had a willing heart. It is disheartening that there is not enough sympathy for these destitute individuals.

Thank you for your letter dated 17th, which I received last night. Amy Reckless visited me yesterday, asking to delay sending for a day or two as she hopes to gather more funds and clothing. President Hamlin's kindness towards the contrabands is appreciated. Their situation is deplorable, especially with the approaching cold weather. I have read the President's emancipation proclamation with gratitude, but upon reflection, I have concerns about the three-month delay before it takes effect. It worries me to think of the potential harm that may come to these individuals during that time.

This event marked the beginning of his lifelong commitment to aiding fugitive slaves on their path to freedom. Despite the community's hostility towards his efforts, Garrett remained resolute in his mission. He harbored fugitives in his home and devised clever strategies to outwit the authorities.

"Lucretia Mott stood up and expressed her concern that it might seem like only Quakerism believed in the guiding principle that influenced this man's life. She clarified that they acknowledged the ""voice within"" as guiding all individuals, similar to how others interpreted the Third person in the Trinity.

The body was taken to the graveyard for burial. The article on Thomas Garrett contained a few inaccuracies. The legal proceedings were civil suits, not public prosecutions, brought by slave owners.

When these events take place among us, we cannot ignore our responsibility towards those who follow Christ. It is us, the collective opinion of the North, who allow these free States to become the hunting grounds where our fellow brothers and sisters suffer as prey. We deny them the basic necessities and rights that all humans deserve. Just as we withhold these essentials, we have the power to provide them. The sheep that Christ instructs us to care for are those who are starving for the help we can offer. We can aid, support, and free them by showing our sincere support for their liberation, by standing against the injustices they face, and by refusing to assist or condone oppression. Dr. Furness was unwavering in his advocacy for the enslaved, even when some friends suggested he was too zealous. He emphasized the importance of action over mere acknowledgment, urging us to move beyond knowing what is right to actively doing what is right.|"['1.

It is true, I have always lived by a simple rule. I never bothered to count the lashes slaves received or travel to the South to study slavery. I just asked myself: Would I want to be a slave? No. Did God make me to be one? No. If I'm not meant to be a slave, then no one is. My family wasn't made for the auction block either. That's why I've always been against slavery. The American abolitionists, who sacrificed so much for this cause, deserve all the credit. I was arrested in 1830 for speaking out against slavery in Baltimore. When I visited in 1864, the prison where I was held had vanished. President Lincoln joked that in 1830 I couldn't get out, and in 1864 I couldn't get in. Maryland had changed, freeing its slaves.|"[""1.

"In 1831, I started the ""_Liberator_"" in Boston, with little fame, no support, and no funds. Yet, the impact was immense, causing an uproar in the South. Despite the nation siding with slavery, the truth prevailed. Georgia even offered $5,000 for my capture.

One Sunday morning, I got a letter informing me that an officer from Savannah, Ga., was searching for two young men who had escaped slavery. They were believed to be in New York City. I decided to go to New York to find them, despite the challenge of searching in a big city. I went to colored churches and schools to spread the word. In a school run by Rev. C.B. Bay, I found one of the young men. He revealed that his father, a doctor, had sold his mother and siblings at an auction. The young man bravely spoke out against the injustice at the auction, warning bidders not to buy him. His brother also stood up against the sale. Both brothers managed to escape and hide in the city. Their fair complexions helped them blend in, with one even working as a blacksmith alongside white colleagues without revealing his true identity. It felt like a miracle to find them and guide them to safety within an hour of leaving my home.|"[""1.

The man rushed back to avoid being missed by his master, who trusted him as a loyal servant. I quickly sought help from a friend to protect the man. After describing the fugitive, my friend recognized him as a boarder in their house. As we discussed, the man arrived, grateful for the chance to hide. I recall many providential escapes of fugitives I knew. I co-owned a horse dedicated to the Underground Railroad. A couple sought help to save their sons from being sold as slaves. One son escaped using a borrowed pass and reached safety after a close call with a scar description. I assisted in guiding the son to freedom. Unfortunately, I can't detail the expenses for the Underground Railroad.

In the evening, a friend brought a bright, handsome boy named Joe to our house. We welcomed Joe warmly, knowing the perils he had escaped. The next day, our house was filled with guests for Thanksgiving. Joe stayed in an upper room, dressed as a boy to flee if needed. The family members who knew about Joe would check on him, feeling grateful and abhorring slavery. Joe had slices of turkey and plum pudding sent to him. It was his first Thanksgiving in a free state. Two days later, Reverend Mr. Freeman accompanied Joe to her uncle's in Canada West. They departed safely, without any trouble or fear, even crossing the Niagara Falls without issue. Mr. Freeman shared their journey details, including the relief of reaching Canada and the challenges they faced along the way.|"['Question 1:\nWhat was the reason for Joe dressing as a boy during his stay at the house?\nA) To participate in a costume party\nB) To escape slavery if needed\nC) To hide his true identity\nD) To impress the family members\nE) To blend in with the other guests', 'Question 2:\nHow did the family members feel about Joe staying at their house?\nA) Indifferent\nB) Annoyed\nC) Grateful\nD) Suspicious\nE) Envious', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Joe receive during Thanksgiving?\nA) Books\nB) Clothes\nC) Money\nD) Slices of turkey and plum pudding\nE) Toys', ""Question 4:\nWhere did Reverend Mr. Freeman accompany Joe two days later?\nA) To a museum\nB) To the local market\nC) To a friend's house\nD) To her uncle's in Canada West\nE) To a theme park"", 'Question 5:\nHow did Joe and Mr. Freeman cross the Niagara Falls?\nA) By swimming\nB) By boat\nC) By helicopter\nD) By train\nE) Without issue', 'Question 6:\nWhat did Mr. Freeman share with the family about their journey to Canada?\nA) Recipes\nB) Shopping tips\nC) Journey details\nD) Movie recommendations\nE) Sports updates']"|"['B) To escape slavery if needed', 'C) Grateful', 'D) Slices of turkey and plum pudding', ""D) To her uncle's in Canada West"", 'E) Without issue', 'C) Journey details']"
When we arrived at the house, we found several guests in the living room along with a few neighbors. I had already shared my name with them, but I hadn't had the chance to introduce Joe properly. While I was introduced to everyone in the room, Joe just took a seat without worrying about being introduced. I asked the landlord for a private conversation, and he led me to another room. I informed him that the young man he referred to was actually a young woman named Ann Maria Weems, who had traveled all the way from Washington City and needed a change of clothes. The landlord was surprised but called his wife, and soon all the women in the house gathered. Joe disappeared with them for a while and then returned as Miss Ann Maria Weems. The whole group stood up, shook hands, laughed, and celebrated, amazed by the unexpected turn of events. Chatham reportedly shelters over three thousand fugitives, and the weather there is no colder than in New York. The following day was Sunday, but I must skip ahead to our journey to D., Mr. Bradley's residence, which began early Monday morning. Due to a rough stretch of road, we arrived late.

I told him that I had to leave soon, and he said he was heading to M. but would be back shortly. As we walked towards his house, he caught up with us, unable to go to M. He then engaged Ann Maria in conversation, asking about her family and their escape from slavery. Upon reaching the house, he went to open the gate and prepare a warm fire. When he reached the gate, his wife approached, mistaking Ann Maria for someone else. They both started crying and embracing, overwhelmed with joy at finding each other. I spent time with them, witnessing their emotional reunion. Ann Maria, once thought lost and enslaved for life, was now free.

No other path could calm my thoughts; why should I be praised for it? Should I view any event as a sacrifice? If a person seeks peace of mind, should they be commended?

It took effort and money to save him from slave-traders. I stood with him on the auction block, and when I stepped down, they thought they had him. But we outsmarted them in the end, much to their dismay. Those were eventful times, and the people of Dover, Delaware, will not forget when S.D. Burris was sold at a public auction for aiding slaves in escaping from their owners and was bought by the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society. I am sincerely your friend.

I was not worried about Molly's safety near where she was caught, thinking her master wouldn't search there. Molly stayed with us a month, but decided to head further North after seeing many fugitives. I contacted Thomas Garrett to find her a good home, which he did. A friend from Pennsylvania took Molly in for over six months. Learning of fugitives being captured and returned due to the Fugitive Slave Law, Molly got anxious and chose to go to Canada. She made it to safety, finally free from American Slavery's torment. Molly described her master as kind when sober but cruel during his binges, delighting in her suffering. She left him and later reached Canada. One morning in December 1845, a wagon arrived at my house with fugitive slaves, led by Samuel D. Burris. They were welcomed, given shelter, and cared for after a long, frosty journey. Burris later directed many more fugitives to me for help.|"['1.

Around two o'clock one day, some people arrived at my house seeking refuge. A neighbor and his daughter also came by in a sleigh for a friendly visit. However, they seemed restless and kept looking out the window towards the road. Little did I know, they were actually spying on the newcomers. The neighbor had seen the newcomers from his house and reported it to Middletown. Soon after, a constable and two others arrived in a sleigh, showing me an advertisement offering a reward for the recovery of three runaway slaves. The constable asked if the slaves were in my house, to which I said no. He requested to search the house, but I refused without a warrant. During our conversation, the husband of a woman with six children emerged from a nearby house and fled into the woods. The constable chased after him with his companions, and after a long pursuit, the man was found near the barn with a knife. The constable demanded the knife, threatening to shoot the man, but I insisted he hand over his pistol first. The man presented a valid pass proving his freedom, signed by a magistrate.

William Streets committed the entire group as runaways from slavery, but Samuel, the husband, was a free man. This was due to his abhorrence of the cruel trade and his friendship for me. Upon reaching the jail at midnight, the sheriff was awakened, and after reviewing the commitment, he questioned Samuel about his status. Samuel, proving his freedom with a valid pass, was informed by the sheriff that the commitment was invalid.

When George witnessed a man being dragged through with a halter around his neck, his blood boiled. Despite the insults from the crowd, he boldly denounced Slavery and its supporters. The poor man was left with his captor as the crowd cheered on. With the advice of those who upheld the slave laws, the rope was removed, and the man was guarded while the master indulged himself. That night, the man vanished with his captor. Daniel Ross, a key figure in the Anti-slavery movement, hosted many in his home, including the Gorsuch murderer. George Corson documented the escape and capture of the Gorsuch murderers. George's father, upon arriving in Philadelphia in 1834, initially held typical Northern views on Slavery. However, the growing sentiment against Slavery stirred his heart, leading him to advocate for change within the bounds of the law.

In 1836, during a break from his studies, a man deeply pondered his stance on the Anti-slavery issue. While visiting a friend in Cincinnati, they both faced danger during riots supporting the cause. This experience clarified their beliefs and motivated them to take action against the prevailing apathy towards humanity.

How his actions, so distinct, show us that a true scholar is always a seeker of truth. Despite facing various forms of opposition from different segments of society - the indifference of the wealthy, the prejudice of some, the disdain of the educated, the reluctance of business or religious leaders fearing disruption - he persistently challenged the prevalent wrongs. Whether on holidays, workdays, or Sundays; at home or outside; in social settings, streets, offices; in his teaching and in the Church - he confronted the apathy and scorn like a refreshing west wind cleansing a city plagued by decay. His influence spread far and wide, sowing seeds of truth indiscriminately. His mission was to awaken his peers to the moral decay caused by complacency, even if they turned against him. Despite his standing in the literary and educational realms, he faced the harshest opposition from the cultured class, where pro-slavery sentiments were deeply rooted. The cultured, in this context, were not truly cultured, but rather adorned with superficial refinement that masked moral decay. Culture, in its true essence, demands intellectual advancement aligned with moral empathy. It must heed the cries of humanity, failing or striving, to be considered genuine culture. Those who crack this veneer of false culture face severe backlash for exposing the sham. For twenty-five years, he endured the revenge of this class, facing social ostracization, scorn, and contempt.

A call to humanity echoes from the West, questioning the omission of slaves in the distribution of Bibles. The American Bible Society's silence on millions without Scriptures is starkly wrong.

The motion was carried by a split vote, reflecting the divisive views on the matter. The resolution praised Professor C.D. Cleveland for his unwavering dedication, despite facing opposition.
