"Title: The Conquest of Mexico

The conquest of Mexico by a small group of Spaniards is a captivating tale from history. The bravery of the Spaniards and their advanced weapons alone could not have secured victory. Mexico's internal strife played a crucial role. The Aztecs ruled harshly over their conquered people, leading to rebellion. The Spaniards found allies among the discontented locals, making their conquest easier. The expedition led by Cortez was a remarkable feat, well-documented by eyewitnesses of the time. Prescott's detailed account of the conquest is a gripping read, surpassing any work of fiction. Middle school students are encouraged to explore this fascinating chapter in history to understand the complexities of conquest and alliances."|"['1.

In the early 16th century, English ships began to challenge the Spanish dominance in the Western Islands. The Swan, a trading vessel owned by Master Diggory Beggs, returned to Plymouth in 1516. Although small by today's standards, the Swan was considered a large ship back then. It carried valuable goods like cloths from Flanders, silks from Italy, and wines from France and Spain. Reuben Hawkshaw, the captain, safely navigated the ship through dangerous encounters with Moorish pirates and bad weather. Upon the Swan's return, Roger, the captain's son, was warmly greeted by his family. Despite the formalities, there was a sense of joy and relief at his safe return. The Beggs family welcomed Roger back with open arms, grateful for his return from the perilous voyage.|"['1.

"""I did what I could with my bow, until I got alongside, and then joined in the melee as well as I could. The heathen fought bravely, but they were not a match for our men; being wanting in weight and strength, and little able to stand up against the crushing blows of our axes. But they are nimble and quick with their curved swords; and the fierceness of their faces, and their shouting, would have put men out of countenance who had less reason to be confident than ours.""

""Do you girls go on with your work. You can sew while you are listening. I will go and see that the preparations for dinner are going on regularly, for the maids are apt to give way to talk and gossip when they know that the Swan is in.""

"Roger replied, ""I don't see that they were the pope's to give. That might do for the king, his minister Wolsey, and the bishops.

Roger, it's a common question but a tough one. Maybe you'll grasp it better when you're married. Women often outsmart men and have sharp tongues. Men may rage loudly when upset, but it fades. Women ponder, release bits of anger like darts, leaving you defenseless. A prick hurts more than a cut, as seen in the battle with the Moors. Men endure wounds silently but cry out over small pains. Your mother was skilled at pricking with her words, causing discomfort. Ships are easier to understand than women, who can be unpredictable. Men think they can manage women, but it's a perilous journey. The ship Swan was being revamped, James Standing and Reuben Hawkshaw overseeing the repairs. Reuben ordered top-quality provisions, surprising the merchants. They were used to cheap supplies, not the high-quality ones Reuben demanded. The ship was stocked with the best, setting a new standard in Plymouth.|"['1.

On the ship, more men arrived in the morning, adding to the surprise of the crew. The new hands were instructed to stay hidden until the ship was far from land to avoid attracting attention. Reuben, one of the crew members, shared plans of seeking a land rumored to be rich in gold. He advised caution and secrecy about their voyage to avoid trouble. Reuben suggested that if they did not return, it would be best to maintain silence and let others assume the ship was lost at sea. He outlined a plan to deflect blame and suspicion by showing official instructions for their intended journey. Reuben also discussed potential outcomes of their quest for gold and advised on how to handle the situation if they did not return.

The wind picked up as the Swan sailed away from the shore, leaving it far behind by midday. The crew settled in, some mending their clothes while others chatted about the ports they would visit. Everyone was in good spirits except for those seasick. Fresh beef was brought on board, and the next morning the ship sailed with a strong northeast wind. Captain Reuben Hawkshaw finally revealed the true purpose of their voyage during a meal, explaining that they were headed west in search of a rich nation with abundant gold.

During the calm weather, the sailors on the ship engaged in various activities to pass the time. They practiced working with the great guns under the guidance of experienced gunners. The captain avoided target practice to prevent attracting unwanted attention from other ships in the area. The crew also participated in different exercises and games to stay occupied. When a sudden gale hit, Reuben Hawkshaw, the captain, took necessary precautions to secure the ship and ensure the safety of his crew. Despite the storm, the ship weathered it well.

I decided to head towards this point because we need to avoid the large islands, which are all under Spanish control. The Spaniards have displaced the natives on these islands and use them as slaves for their plantations and mines. Looking at the map, you can see that there are no Spanish posts in the islands we will be passing by, except for a small one at San Salvador. We will sail through these islands until we reach Columbus Point on San Salvador, the island Christopher Columbus discovered in 1492. From there, we will head west towards Andros and then due west. This route will keep us away from the typical path of the Spaniards, who head south towards Porto Rico before reaching Hispaniola and Cuba. We must navigate carefully, especially around the numerous scattered small islands that pose a sailing hazard, especially at night. It is crucial to compare our logbooks daily to correct any navigation errors, especially in accounting for drift caused by the wind. Our goal is to find an island with water and fruit to replenish our supplies without having to fight the Spaniards or the natives. If we encounter the natives, we must show them our peaceful intentions to trade. As we approach the first island, we must signal our peaceful intentions with a white flag and be prepared to defend ourselves if necessary.|"['1.

When the boat reached the shore, the captain saw a group of natives waving green branches. There were two apparent chiefs and about thirty others. They appeared peaceful, so the captain leaped ashore. Roger was fascinated by these individuals. They were slightly darker than Moors, tall with slender figures, soft faces, and large dark eyes. They wore cotton petticoats, belts with shells, and carried spears and bows. The captain gave them blue bead necklaces and hatchets, which they cherished. The natives offered baskets filled with unknown fruits as a gesture of goodwill. The crew received the fruits eagerly. The captain indicated a desire to trade using beads and hawk bells.

The wind had completely died down, leaving the Swan almost motionless on the water. Despite the intense heat, the men were eager to reach land. They followed the captain's orders to use the boats to tow the ship to the other side of the island. Once anchored, the captain addressed the crew. He explained that only half of them could go ashore to ensure the ship's safety. To decide who would go, the boatswain would draw lots. The captain emphasized fair treatment of the natives and conducting trade honestly. Goods for trading were taken ashore by the first mate and boatswain.

Captain Reuben decided that the crew had bought enough supplies and needed to avoid more. The next day, many crew members fell ill from eating too much fruit. Roger and Pengarvan explored the island with the captain, admiring the unique trees, flowers, and birds. A dispute arose among the crew about the birds' nature until they saw a chief with bird feathers. The captain bought some feathers for four copper rings and a small mirror. The ship refilled its water casks and prepared to sail. The crew visited several islands but found little trade.

Three or four minutes later, the sails were raised, and the Spanish ship started moving through the water after setting sail once the anchors were lifted. The Spaniards fired their bow guns towards the Swan, but Captain Reuben decided not to retaliate. He believed the Spaniards mistook them for local traders trying to avoid fines. Despite being chased by the Spaniards, the Swan managed to keep ahead, and the Spaniards ceased firing in the afternoon. As they approached an island, the Spaniards fired again as a signal. Captain Reuben and Pengarvan were concerned about potential Spanish ships near the island. A large ship appeared, and the Swan changed direction to avoid the Spanish vessels.

After sunset, as night fell, the Swan's sails hung still as the breeze vanished. The captain quickly ordered the boats down, and the men rowed silently. Listening intently, the captain heard oars in the distance. He hoped the pursuers were towing, as the Swan's crew could outpace them rowing. The wind picked up, relieving the strain on the hawsers. The pursuers closed in, and the officers urged the rowers on. The Swan prepared to defend against boarding. When the wind filled the sails, the vessel surged forward. The pursuers drew nearer, but the Swan's crew remained silent, ready to repel any attack. The boats were called back, no longer needed as the Swan sailed swiftly away.|"['1.

The crew of the Swan faced a fierce storm, struggling to keep the ship afloat as the wind howled around them. The captain and his exhausted crew battled the elements, trying to steer the vessel through treacherous waters. The ship rolled and pitched, threatening to capsize at any moment. As dawn broke on the fourth day, land loomed ahead, a perilous sight for the weary sailors. With a sudden turn of events, a massive wave struck the ship, washing some of the crew overboard. The situation grew dire as the mizzen mast snapped, adding to the chaos. Despite the odds, the Swan managed to right itself and continue its tumultuous journey towards the rocky coast. The captain, resigned to their fate, sent a crew member to assess the losses, knowing that only a miracle could save them now.|['1.

The ship was in peril as it neared the shore, with the crew preparing for impact. The first mate and Pengarvan readied the anchors and cables for a desperate attempt to avoid disaster. As the vessel approached within a quarter mile of the rocky coast, the anchors were dropped, but the force of the waves caused the cables to snap. In a final effort to save themselves, Roger was instructed to climb to the end of the bowsprit in hopes of leaping onto the rocks.

After a long time, he regained consciousness. When he did, he crawled to the cliff's edge and saw that the Swan had vanished. There was no trace of her, not even a piece of wood on the water. Roger returned, feeling defeated, and wept. Hours passed until the scorching sun woke him up. He stood and observed the cultivated land ahead with maize patches and a village in the distance. Despite his injuries, he made his way to the village. As he neared, three women with baskets fled in fear. The villagers, armed with spears and bows, were puzzled by his appearance and color. They thought him a supernatural being and bowed in awe. Roger, indifferent to danger, sat at a hut's entrance. The villagers offered him pulque to drink and flatbread and fruits to eat, which he accepted to please them.|"['1.

The leader guided him to a large stone house, no taller than the others but well-built. The roof, thatched roughly, would offer little protection from rain, a rarity on the coast. Villagers of importance followed the chief, along with girls and women who greeted him respectfully. They marveled at his fair skin, contrasting with his sun-kissed face and hands. The chief inquired about his origin, to which he gestured from the sea, indicating a long journey. A procession approached, led by two high-ranking individuals adorned in feathered mantles, gold circlets, and white petticoats.

A loud cheer greeted Roger as he arrived. The villagers were amazed by his fair skin visible under his cloak. They saw his acceptance of the garment as a sign of goodwill. The ambassadors gestured for him to join them, and Roger agreed. The group proceeded with the chiefs by his side and the villagers following, singing a chant. After an hour, they reached a large town with tall buildings. The people there, armed with spears and bows, lined the streets to welcome him. As they entered, the townspeople cheered loudly.

After the leader departed, a long line of town residents visited Roger, bearing gifts like garlands, fruit, cakes, and trinkets. They even brought cocoa, a popular drink among the natives. As night fell, the visitors finally stopped coming. The old slave closed the door with a hanging, and a young girl brought Roger a bowl of cocoa and fruit cakes. After enjoying the cocoa, Roger laid down on quilted mats, feeling utterly exhausted. Alone in the room, he couldn't help but break down, mourning the loss of his father and friends. Overwhelmed by grief, he sobbed uncontrollably until a young slave girl, Malinche, showed him kindness and compassion. Her gesture brought Roger comfort, and he eventually fell asleep, waking up to the realization that he was in a strange land, far from home.|['1.

After washing up, Roger felt refreshed and dressed in a Mexican outfit. Two girls brought him a tray with cocoa, fruits, and bread. He wanted to thank Malinche, but she avoided eye contact, hinting she didn't want others to know she visited him. Visitors kept coming to see the strange white man in Tabasco. Roger learned the names of objects by touching and listening. He struggled to understand the language until he observed the girls and the old woman. Malinche warned him not to reveal his origins to the chief to avoid danger. Roger followed her advice and kept silent, impressing the chief with tales of his faraway homeland.

The chief was fascinated by the mysterious knife Roger gave him, as it was made of a metal stronger and harder than copper, known to them. Roger's tales intrigued the people, but some doubted his supernatural origin due to the lack of extraordinary powers. As his popularity waned, Roger was moved inland to prevent him from joining other white men trading with the natives. The chief feared Roger's presence would attract attention, so he kept him secluded. When Roger returned to Tabasco, he learned of the arrival of a ship led by Grijalva, trading with the locals. The chief had hidden Roger to avoid any interference with the newcomers. This secrecy caused Roger to ponder his situation, unsure of what lay ahead.|"['1.

Roger had been stranded in Tabasco for six months. He learned the native language fluently and gained insights about the region from Malinche, a former slave. She revealed details about the Aztecs, a powerful civilization to the west. They had conquered many lands, including Tabasco, and were known for their wealth in gold. Malinche's story of being sold into slavery by her mother shed light on the harsh realities of her past. Roger, now a towering figure among the natives, stood out with his strength and size, earning respect and preventing open hostility. As he strolled confidently through Tabasco, his presence commanded attention and admiration. Despite the challenges, Roger's determination to escape and explore the Aztec lands grew stronger as he continued to learn their language.|"['1.

Roger learned from Malinche about the trade between Mexico and neighboring countries, where merchants traveled in groups with armed escorts. He anticipated their return to Tabasco in about a year. Feeling increasingly unsafe due to growing hostility, he awaited their arrival. Malinche's tales of the Aztecs intrigued him, describing them as superior in civilization and invincible in war. She explained the Aztec practice of sacrificing prisoners for the gods, contrasting it with death in battle. Roger disagreed, preferring a battle death to sacrificial killing. Malinche, accustomed to the Aztec religion, struggled to grasp his horror at the sacrifices. She shared the story of Quetzalcoatl, a kind god who brought prosperity to Anahuac but was forced to leave due to jealousy from other gods.|"['1.

Long ago, a man named Quetzalcoatl sailed away promising to return someday. The people believed that white people would come from the sea in his place. Roger, a tall white man, was thought to be one of Quetzalcoatl's descendants. He shared stories with Malinche about his land where people fought with thunderous weapons. Roger warned that the Spaniards might come to conquer their land too. When Aztec traders arrived, Roger stayed home, fearing for his safety. The traders, respected as warriors and merchants, displayed their skills and traded goods.

The traders, wearing fancy feather cloaks and headpieces adorned with bright plumes, greeted the chief upon his arrival at their tent. Through an interpreter, they conversed with the chief before bringing Roger, who had been at the back of the group, to the forefront. The traders examined him carefully, conversed among themselves, and then invited the chief into their tent. The chief stayed inside for a while, then emerged and instructed four soldiers to escort him back to town, leaving the rest to trade freely. The chief informed Roger that the Anahuan traders desired to take him to their land in exchange for slaves and goods. He emphasized that Roger was not his slave and that he should decide freely, as his presence had caused unrest among some of his people and priests who saw him as a potential sacrifice. Despite the chief's good intentions towards Roger, he acknowledged that his departure would be beneficial due to the growing opposition and potential dangers he faced.

Roger, a young boy not yet eighteen, found himself in a challenging situation. He promised Malinche, a girl who had been like a sister to him, that he would return for her if he thrived in her country. However, he explained that in his homeland, marriage was a serious matter and not something he was ready for. He reassured Malinche that he would send for her if he succeeded, but if he failed, she would know by his silence. Despite the tears shed at their parting, Roger left behind gifts and promises, knowing the uncertainty of his future among the people who believed he might be a god.

"After careful consideration, he decided not to reveal the truth to the Anahuans. It seemed futile and risky. He vowed not to worship their gods or partake in their cruel rituals.

After leaving the Tabascan villages, the caravans traveled through sparsely populated areas until they reached a large village where the Anahuac language was spoken. The principal merchant explained they were now in the country of the king, where the language was spoken similarly by different tribes that had migrated from the north. The Aztecs and Tezcucans were two great tribes that formed an alliance with Tlacopan, conquering lands from sea to sea. The Aztecs were recognized as the leading power due to their warlike nature and great monarchs. Despite this, the Tezcucans maintained their own laws and customs while acknowledging the Aztec emperor as the head of their confederacy.

After a long day's journey, they found themselves four thousand feet above sea level, surrounded by lush greenery and bright landscapes, evidence of frequent rainfall. The road was lined with liquid amber trees, and towering mountains covered in snow loomed on both sides. The merchant shared tales of volcanic eruptions that had once devastated the area, leaving behind massive flows of molten rock. As they trekked through the mountains, they reached a plateau at seven thousand feet, where oak and cypress trees flourished, and fields were filled with aloe and maguey plants. The cold nights were a stark contrast to the pleasant daytime temperatures. Moving through a range of hills, they encountered the Cordilleras, massive snow-capped mountains with feared volcanoes. Despite the hardships, they pressed on, eventually reaching the bustling town of Tepeaca, nestled in a densely populated plateau below. Rested and adorned with gifts from the merchants, Roger prepared for the final leg of their journey into the town.|['1.

The group of traders marched in a strict formation, with the merchants flaunting their finest garments at the front. The porters walked four abreast, flanked by soldiers who ensured they stayed in line. As they neared Tepeaca, crowds lined the road, eager to catch a glimpse of the remarkable white man. Roger, towering over the locals at six feet two inches, was a spectacle to behold. Two nobles from the town approached, bedecked in gold cuirasses and feather mantles, with one sporting a puma helmet and the other a silver headpiece adorned with jewels and feathers. They saluted Roger respectfully, and incense filled the air as they conversed. The nobles presented Roger with a variety of exquisite gifts, including gold armor, jewelry, feathered crests, and silk robes. Roger, although wishing he had more to offer in return, graciously accepted the gifts.|"[""1.

When all the goods were displayed, Roger spoke to the ambassadors, expressing his pleasure in the gifts. He mentioned that he valued them not for their luxury but as symbols of the king's goodwill and power. Roger asked the ambassadors to convey his sincere thanks and regrets to the king for not bringing any gifts in return. He explained that he came empty-handed from a distant land across the seas, where people traveled in large floating castles and rode animals as fast as the wind. He described weapons that made thunderous noises and could defeat enemies from miles away. The nobles listened attentively, finding it believable that a supernatural being like Roger could travel great distances without mortal equipment. Roger then talked about a metal of extraordinary hardness that was used for making powerful weapons and armor. He mentioned that he might teach the nobles how to work with this metal in the future. Impressed by his speech, the nobles invited Roger into the city, where they welcomed him with cheers and flower wreaths. The Aztec governor greeted Roger and offered him gifts of great value, inviting him to visit the Emperor Montezuma's capital. Roger accepted the invitation, and they proceeded to a grand banquet where they dined on golden dishes and drank pulque served in golden goblets by white-robed slaves.|"[""1.

The meal served to Roger was a feast of unfamiliar dishes. A large bird mistaken for a swan or peacock turned out to be a turkey. The table was adorned with vases of silver and gold. After the meal, hands and faces were washed with basins of water. To Roger's surprise, a substance made from leaves and sticks was brought out. Smoke was created by lighting the sticks and bowls. The Mexicans seemed calm, showing it was a regular practice. Young dancers entertained the guests with graceful moves and chants. The ambassadors suggested a siesta after the feast. Roger marveled at the people's wealth and customs, finding the gold and magnificence commonplace. The gifts he received seemed grand but held little value in their culture.|['1.

Malinche shared with me that each year, a special prisoner is chosen for sacrifice, treated with respect and luxury until the time of death. I wish I were back with my companions, facing the unknown alone among people who breathe smoke and offer gifts one day, possibly death the next. Despite feeling isolated, I aim to represent my country and beliefs honorably. The idea of sacrificing captives is incomprehensible to me, given the gentle demeanor of these people. I hope to make allies, knowing the priests hold great power. Armed with a sword, I ventured to the Great Temple, where a pyramid structure loomed, adorned with an eerie display of human skulls.

Roger decided to stick to his beliefs without offending the locals' religious sentiments. Despite being startled by the sight of a heap of skulls, he controlled his emotions and tried to count them. Roger struggled with the Aztec method of counting but estimated around a hundred thousand skulls in the pile. This led him to ponder the vast number of human sacrifices across the country. He expressed that gods like Quetzalcoatl, who taught men peacefully, wouldn't approve of such bloodshed. The Aztec governor seemed uneasy at the thought, while the Tezcucan envoys were pleased as their people practiced a milder form of worship. Roger firmly stated his allegiance to a god of peace and refused to partake in human sacrifices. The Aztec governor, impressed by Roger's knowledge of Quetzalcoatl, reported their conversation to Emperor Montezuma, who, though mild, was influenced by the priests who favored sacrifices.|"['1.

Roger was silent for the rest of the journey that day. His initial admiration for the arts and civilization of the people had turned into abhorrence. He had learned from Malinche that victims sacrificed to the gods were cooked and eaten, and seeing the heap of human skulls made him believe it. Despite the warm welcomes and celebrations in each city they passed, Roger felt low and depressed. He couldn't shake off the feeling of bloodshed everywhere. Learning that sacrifices were made to please the gods before his arrival added to his distress. He felt like a mockery, hearing the screams of the victims amidst the joyful greetings. The priests, unsure of his standing, kept away from him. They held the knowledge and practices of the nation, including astrology and divination. The Aztec priests were skilled in various sciences and were divided into different ranks and classes. They were devoted to specific deities and had quarters within the temple precincts. The priests led a disciplined life, practicing fasting and penance. They administered baptism, confession, and absolution rites, similar to Christian practices. The repetition of forgiven sins was considered unforgivable. Education was a crucial duty of the priesthood, with separate buildings for youth education within each city's main temple. Boys and girls were trained in various disciplines, with girls taught by priestesses. The discipline in these schools was strict, focusing on tradition, law, hieroglyphics, government principles, and sciences. Girls were trained in feminine skills like weaving and embroidery|"[""1.

The temples were funded by lands given by rulers and managed by priests, seen as good leaders treating tenants kindly. They received first fruits and rich gifts, sharing extra with the needy, as charity was vital. The Aztec faith had both good and bad aspects. It had strong morals akin to Christianity but also gruesome sacrifices. This mix was due to the blending of gentle Toltec beliefs with Aztec rituals. Roger, unaware of this, saw only the dark side. Traveling to the capital, they bypassed Puebla and Cholula, heading towards Mexico. The view amazed Roger, with Mexico City and Tezcuco visible. The past Tezcucan prince's tale was shared, depicting his escape from the Tepanecs and eventual rule, marked by amnesty and governance reforms.|"['1.

Three departments were established in Tezcuco: the Council of War, the Council of Finance, and the Council of Justice. Citizens were allowed seats in these bodies alongside nobles and state officers. The Council of State, composed of fourteen nobles, was the highest body advising the king on important matters. The Council of Music, open to all knowledgeable individuals, promoted science and art. They reviewed and approved works before public release, supervised art productions, and evaluated teachers and students. This council also awarded prizes for historical compositions and moral poems. The king and allied state rulers participated in prize decisions. Tezcuco was the hub of education, science, and art in Anahuac. Nezahualcoyotl, a religious monarch, developed agriculture and arts, with grand palaces and buildings. His son, Nezahualpilli, continued the legacy, emphasizing astronomy, justice, and public structures. Despite Tezcuco's decline due to internal turmoil, Montezuma of Mexico expanded his empire. The young King Cacama inherited a troubled kingdom, ruled by an elective council. Roger, intrigued by Tezcuco's governance, pondered the contrast between their advanced arts and barbaric rituals. The party avoided Aztec-controlled cities en route to the capital, fearing Montezuma's interference.|"['1.

After a long journey through a well-cultivated area, they neared the town of Tezcuco as evening approached. A messenger had gone ahead to announce their arrival time, and soldiers waited outside to guide them to the royal palace. The soldiers lined up to escort the group through the city. Roger was amazed by the grand houses and beautiful gardens with lush trees, colorful flowers, and ponds. The capital's buildings were more magnificent than any he had seen in Genoa or Cadiz. The people in the city were well-dressed, wearing cotton cloaks with intricate designs and fringes. Women wore fur or feather mantles and decorated skirts. The guards led them through the crowd to the king's palace, a stunning structure adorned with gold plates and embroidered hangings. Inside, the young king and his court welcomed them warmly.|"[""1.

King Hal would not expect Roger to bow before him like a worm, even if he granted an audience. Roger believed he should not lower himself as an Englishman to bow before any monarch. He refused to acknowledge himself as a humble subject, as it would diminish his self-worth. Instead, he decided to salute the king as equals. Surprisingly, the king was not offended by Roger's breach of etiquette. He admired Roger's stature, honest face, blue eyes, and sunny hair. The king welcomed Roger, expressing curiosity about his distant homeland and language. Roger explained about ships, weapons, and horses to the king, who was fascinated by the different colors and capabilities of the animals. Roger even sketched a horse for the king, impressing him with the lifelike representation. The conversation continued with Roger describing knights in armor and cannons made of iron and brass.

Your Majesty, I have used these weapons but did not make them. Crafting them requires great skill. I am unsure if the country has iron ore for cannons. The powder needs charcoal, saltpeter, and sulfur, but I am unsure if these are available here. Teaching how to make them may lead to more terrible battles. We treat prisoners honorably, exchanging them or taking ransom for knights and nobles. Roger mentioned a temple to the Unknown God, worshipped across the sea by white people. The king, hesitant about human sacrifices, changed the subject. Roger, after living among natives, had acquired their quiet and dignified manner.

The king guided them to a moderately large apartment, smaller than the grand halls they had just left. Quilted mats with silk embroidery lined the room, exuding comfort and luxury. Through the open windows, they glimpsed a charming garden below and the moonlit walls and temples of Mexico across the lake, adorned with flickering lights atop the teocallis. The room was illuminated by open lamps with cotton wicks in wax. Soon, the guests arrived, shedding the formalities typical of royalty in Tezcuco. The young king, eager to converse freely, asked Roger about his name and people. As they settled on couches, enjoying cocoa and treats, the king expressed surprise at Roger's refusal of tobacco, a common commodity among their seafaring neighbors.

Your Majesty, I assure you that the facts I share are true as lying is considered disgraceful in my country. While some things may seem extraordinary, they are indeed real. In my land, people find it hard to believe that others enjoy smoking burning plants. White people, like those on your side of the water, are divided into nations, with some more powerful than others. Two countries claim rights over unexplored seas due to discoveries, strength, and papal confirmation. Despite past wars, we now live in peace. My father, a ship captain, sought to discover a rumored land of riches far to the west. Unfortunately, his ship was wrecked, and I survived, destined to reach your great country as the first white man. The prophecy of Quetzalcoatl's return and the fear of white people's arrival were foreseen by my father, though we are not a nation of conquerors.

Your Majesty, I do not believe your nation needs to fear being conquered by the Spaniards, as they are a powerful people who have extended their rule over distant lands and islands. While they could potentially send a large force from Spain, the cost and logistics of such an expedition make it unlikely. Trade between your nation and the Spanish could be mutually beneficial, as they have goods like silks and velvets that you would value, while you possess items like delicate embroidery that would interest them. Gold is highly valued among them, and they have superior ironwork and arms. Roger Hawkshaw, in a lighter conversation with Maclutha and the queen, shared sketches of European fashion that amazed them, showing the differences in clothing styles between their cultures.|"[""1.

Roger was amazed by the armor worn by the men, enclosed in metal, which prevented movement and breathing. He explained that in the hot climate of Mexico, the heat would be unbearable, but the men in armor were carried on horses and didn't need to move much except for their arms. However, he pointed out that the armor could not withstand cannon fire or heavy maces. The king decided to keep the presence of the Spaniards a secret to avoid causing panic and unrest among the people. Roger agreed to keep the secret, understanding the potential dangers if the information spread. He promised to only speak guardedly about the wonders of the distant land inhabited by white men and to maintain a sense of mystery about himself.|['1.

The king expressed satisfaction, acknowledging the mystery of the protagonist's ability to speak their language. The protagonist revealed learning from a Mexican slave girl in Tabasco. The king assigned a young noble, Cuitcatl, to guide the protagonist, showing him the city and granting him a seat in the council. The noble led the protagonist to his chambers in the palace, explaining the nobles' living arrangements. The protagonist, exhausted, quickly fell asleep. The next morning, he awoke to a stunning garden view from his window, filled with fountains, ponds, and birds.

In the palace, Cuitcatl explained that every apartment includes a bathroom. The water flows only for an hour after sunrise, but it can be used at any time. The excess water goes into a tank for the garden fountains. Visitors can have attendants rub them in the bath or after. They decided to visit the gardens early to enjoy the arbors and pavilions. The birds in the garden are friendly, as they are accustomed to visitors and enjoy abundant food. Some birds are caged, like hawks and eagles, while others freely roam. The marketplace was orderly, with different sections for various goods like cotton, goldsmiths, pottery, and military supplies. The people were respectful and greeted Roger warmly as he explored the diverse offerings.|['1.

In the bustling market of Mexico, shops brimmed with medicinal plants and hieroglyphic scrolls. The stalls offered hides, leather goods, and a variety of provisions like meats, fruits, and ready-to-eat foods. Roger then strolled to the lakeside, watching canoes ferrying people between cities. Later, at the palace, a noble gathering took place where Roger's mysterious aura intrigued the attendees. The king's concern about Roger's presence led to preparations for a trip to Mexico City. Despite the potential danger, Roger hoped to convince the priests of his benign intentions. Cacama, a noble, pondered the risks of aiding Roger's escape due to the priests' power. Roger, however, remained hopeful that his visit to Mexico City might dispel the priests' suspicions.|"['1.

Amenche, speaking fervently, assured Roger that the priests in Mexico do not intend to harm him. They view him as a rare offering, believing that a white man would be the most fitting sacrifice for their god. Cacama, tenderly addressing his sister, explained his inability to resist the demands due to his diminished authority. However, he promised to use his influence with the priests and his connections at Montezuma's court to sway the decision in Roger's favor. Cacama suggested a trial by combat as an alternative to sacrifice, where Roger could fight multiple opponents to earn his freedom. Roger expressed his preference for this option, willing to face the challenge honorably. Cacama vowed to advocate for Roger's safety and proposed the trial as a means to demonstrate his divine favor.|"['1.

"""I must do my best,"" Roger whispered. ""I've been trained well in using weapons during our voyage. In terms of skill, I could match anyone on board, even though many saw me as just a child in strength. However, I believe I have grown stronger since then."" Cacama conveyed his wife and sister's farewells, expressing their sadness at his departure and hoping for his return that afternoon. As they rowed across the lake to Mexico, they were met with a strong guard upon landing, ushered to the palace. The grandeur of Mexico was evident, with buildings similar to Tezcuco but not more magnificent. Roger was instructed on palace etiquette and entered Montezuma's presence humbly. Despite initial apprehension, Montezuma was favorably impressed by Roger's demeanor and explanations. After a cordial audience, Roger was led to a separate room for a meal, served by silent attendants. Cacama hurried Roger away, leading him through the palace to a waiting boat, swiftly departing from the palace."|"['1.

Cacama shared with Roger the challenges faced during the council meeting. The decision was postponed due to differing opinions. Roger's fate was debated, whether he would be treated as a guest or a prisoner. Cacama decided to take Roger back to Tezcuco and present him when needed to avoid unrest. Roger's artistic talent played a crucial role. His paintings impressed the council, especially Montezuma, who admired the lifelike quality of the drawings. Roger's artistic journey began in Plymouth, where he learned from monks. His talent flourished during sea voyages. Upon his return, Cacama provided him with materials to create a stunning painting that amazed all who saw it.

"""You are now safe, for the present,"" he assured, ""and the priests are silent. You may face challenges ahead, but Montezuma's appreciation for art has overshadowed his concerns about omens."" Cacama disagreed, stating that Tezcuco remained the hub for arts and sciences in Anahuac. Montezuma was likely to send scribes to learn from Roger in Tezcuco rather than summon him to the capital. The next day, a message arrived confirming this plan. Six skilled scribes from Mexico would be sent to Tezcuco to learn from Roger. He was provided with a room in the palace, models, and supplies to teach the scribes. Roger found it amusing to lead an art school, teaching the scribes to sketch realistically instead of conventionally. Despite the threat of being summoned back to Mexico City, Roger continued his daily routine, spending time with Cuitcatl and exploring the town and its surroundings."|"[""1.

There is no time to waste. Quickly go to the garden and hide near the eagle house. I will inform Cacama of your location, and he will come or send someone to advise you on the next steps. Do not delay. The instructions are urgent, and they will be here shortly to capture you. Roger swiftly gathered his belongings, armed himself, and with Cuitcatl, hurried towards the garden. They cautiously made their way to the eagle house, staying out of sight from the palace. Cuitcatl suggested seeking refuge in the garden for the night. He advised Roger to return to his chamber to avoid suspicion. Roger urged Cuitcatl to leave to gather information and assistance.

"Orders have been given to the city guard to detain you immediately, wherever you may be located. The envoys swiftly departed to the waterside with their guard. Until then, Cacama, who had stayed with them, was unaware of your whereabouts, appearing anxious and troubled. ""Would it not be wiser, Your Majesty,"" I suggested, ""for you to remain unaware?

Roger quickly changed into the peasant's clothes, stained himself with the liquid from the jug, and rubbed it into his hair. Cuitcatl escorted him outside under the moonlight, remarking on his height. As they walked, Roger expressed his skill with the bow, contrasting it with the weapons of the Aztecs. Cuitcatl reassured him that he wouldn't be harmed, as orders were to capture him alive. Roger watched the moon set, contemplating his upcoming adventures. He bid farewell to the queen, who gifted him a bag of gems from the royal treasure.

During the day, they were undisturbed and only resumed their journey after sunset. The terrain was challenging, with steep hills and deep valleys to navigate. When the moon set, they paused until dawn due to the darkness making it too risky to continue. Bathalda pointed out the plateau ahead and the town of Otompan in the distance, emphasizing the need to head west to Tlatlanquitepec and Perote, where the danger would increase. They planned to avoid detection by traveling at night and taking detours. The next night, they covered around fifty miles, encountering troops and couriers during the day.

As night fell, they changed their direction to the south due to the dangerous mountains ahead. The journey was exhausting as they traversed the hill spurs into the plateau. They paused when the moon set but resumed at daybreak. Roger recognized the road leading to Yxtacamaxtitlan, and they were about fifteen miles from it. After passing that town, they would face the challenging Pass of Obispo over the mountain range. Once past Naulinco, their risks would decrease as the Tierra Caliente had fewer settlements. The main peril lay in the pass, where they would be easily tracked. Roger suggested proceeding cautiously and avoiding large enemy forces. They planned to reach the pass before nightfall and navigate through the woods during daylight for safety. Resting now was crucial as they anticipated more challenges ahead.|['1.

The expedition led by Hernando Cortez caused great excitement in Mexico. Cortez possessed all the qualities of a great leader: handsome, strong, courageous, and skilled in arms. Born in 1485, he was mischievous in school but later became a successful soldier. After a series of events, including imprisonment and escape, Cortez was appointed captain general of an expedition to explore Yucatan. He raised funds, gathered recruits, and set sail with six ships and three hundred men. His mission was to find Grijalva, explore the coastline, and treat the natives kindly. Despite facing suspicions and attempts to replace him as commander, Cortez's determination and leadership skills prevailed as he embarked on this significant journey.|"['1.

In November 1516, Cortez, feeling undermined by Velasquez, sailed for Macaca. Despite orders to seize Cortez, Verdugo hesitated due to potential resistance. Cortez, gathering recruits and supplies in Trinidad, was joined by high-ranking cavaliers like the Alvarados. In Havana, despite Velasquez's attempts to stop him, Cortez set sail on February 10th, 1519. The expedition, comprising eleven vessels, soldiers, sailors, and horses, embarked with enthusiasm after a rousing speech. Along the coast of Yucatan, they met Aquilar, a captive priest, who had lived among the natives for eight years. The expedition then faced hostility at the Tabasco River, unlike the friendly reception Grijalva had previously experienced.|"[""1.

After calling for surrender, Cortez arrived. The locals fought but couldn't resist the Spaniards' guns. The invaders took over the town, deserted. The next day, scouts were attacked, reporting the area was armed. Cortez, upset at the war, landed guns and horses. They attacked the enemy but struggled due to the terrain. Suddenly, Cortez's cavalry appeared, causing panic among the natives. The enemy fled, and many fell. Cortez forgave the captives and asked for submission. They agreed, offering gifts. The Spaniards set sail for San Juan de Uloa. Unable to communicate, they found an interpreter, Malinche. Learning about the Mexican Empire, they landed and built a camp. Locals traded goods and shared news about the Mexican governor's visit.|"['1.

Before midday, he reached with his large group. A feast was provided, and in response to the leader's questions about their purpose, Cortez explained that he was a representative of a powerful king from far away, bearing gifts and a message for the Mexican Emperor. The leader promised to send the gifts to Montezuma and communicate his response. Ten loads of cotton, feathered mantles, and gold ornaments were given to Cortez, who then passed on his gifts for Montezuma. The leader's artist sketched the Spaniards and their equipment in the Aztec style of picture writing. Cortez showcased his cavalry and cannons to be drawn and sent to Montezuma. Subsequently, an envoy from Montezuma arrived with valuable gifts, including gold and silver items. Despite the refusal of a personal meeting, Cortez persisted, but the Mexicans remained firm. The soldiers faced difficulties, and Cortez planned to sail north, but the soldiers desired to stay and establish a colony. Five Totonacs sought Cortez's help against the Aztecs, offering hope for alliances. Cortez and his companions considered the potential for a permanent settlement in the region.|['1.

Cortez, a Spanish explorer, faced opposition from Velasquez's supporters. Despite intending to follow orders, Cortez's soldiers urged him to establish a settlement. Eventually, Cortez yielded, naming officials and declaring the land a Spanish colony. Some of Velasquez's allies rebelled, leading Cortez to take drastic measures. He won over his troops, who willingly surrendered their treasures to fund a gift for the emperor. Cortez then destroyed most ships to prevent a mutiny, keeping only one. Despite initial unrest, Cortez reassured his soldiers, convincing them to trust his leadership. With newfound resolve, they set out for Mexico, avoiding detection by Aztec scouts.

"Roger and his companions were climbing rapidly towards a narrow pass in the mountains. As they ascended, the trees thinned out, revealing steep rocky terrain ahead. Suddenly, the sound of a horn filled the air, and a group of men emerged from the trees, chasing after them.

Facing the steep rocks, the group had to use both hands and feet to climb. The Aztecs, their pursuers, were close behind. Roger, an expert archer, warned the Aztecs to stop their pursuit, but they ignored him. In response, Roger skillfully shot arrows, hitting several of the Aztecs.

When the Aztecs attempted to cut them off, Roger and Bathalda fought bravely. Roger used his quarterstaff and ax to fend off the attackers, displaying incredible strength and skill.

The sight of their fallen comrades on the slope had dampened the spirits of the group. Their officers had been taken down by Roger's arrows, leaving the rest of the comrades to continue the pursuit from a distance. Roger and his companion focused on climbing, facing steep cliffs and making detours. After hours of effort, they reached the snow near two tall peaks. The Aztecs were far behind. They planned to descend until off the snow, then move through the woods to mislead their pursuers. Once in the forest, they hunted a bear for food. Roger contemplated the situation, knowing the Spaniards would intensify their search. He decided they should retreat across the mountains, head north, and seek refuge in the vast forests to evade capture, sustain themselves by hunting, and wait until the search subsided before considering their next move.|"['1.

Roger and Bathalda needed to cross the crest before morning to avoid detection by sentries. Bathalda offered to keep watch while Roger rested. They ate, and Bathalda cooked more food for the journey ahead. The moonlight helped them climb the mountain easily. After six hours, they descended to the other side and lit a fire for warmth.

Two days' journey led them deep into the forest north of Tlatlanquitepec. They built a rough shelter near a spring and hunted turkeys abundantly. Bathalda mimicked the turkeys' call to lure them close for easy shots. Small bears provided food and warmth, while deer and other game were plentiful. At night, they heard mountain tigers, seeking refuge in trees when too close. Bathalda brought supplies and news of white strangers from town. The strangers arrived, welcomed by the natives, but Montezuma ordered them to leave. The white men defied him, moving north to found a city, causing outrage by insulting Aztec gods. Roger was amazed by their audacity against Mexico's might. The news of their defiance spread, with the white men's intentions to stay permanently surprising many.|"[""1.

Roger received news after almost three weeks. Bathalda had hurt his leg in a fall while hunting deer and had to rest in the hut for over two weeks. Upon recovery, they embarked on a turkey hunt before Bathalda shared surprising news. White men had traveled from the coast through Naulinco and the Pass of Obispo, welcomed by the Totonac tribe. They visited Yxtacamaxtitlan, a grand city, and then headed to Tlascala, a republic that had resisted Mexico for long. The white men had unique weapons and were accompanied by Totonac fighters and porters. Despite battles, the white men triumphed, capturing the city, leaving the country in shock.

Roger quickly identified his friend, Malinche, the former slave girl from Tabasco. He noticed how she had transformed into a confident and elegantly dressed woman, commanding respect from both the Spaniards and local leaders. Impressed by her beauty, Roger discreetly followed the group as they discussed important matters. When Malinche briefly stepped away from the group, Roger seized the moment to approach her. After a brief exchange, he discreetly retreated into the crowd and later rendezvoused with Bathalda. The two found a quiet spot on a wall to wait. Malinche later emerged and recognized Roger, inviting him into the palace. In a secluded garden, Malinche expressed her joy at seeing Roger and offered to introduce him to Cortez. However, Roger confided in Malinche, seeking her help to conceal his true origins from the Spaniards.

"""They will easily believe that you may have been wrecked,"" said Malinche. ""There were other white men living among them, though these they could not recover. You saw him by me this morning--he is an old man, a priest; and he translates from the Spanish into the Yucatan dialect, which is so like that of Tabasco that I can understand it, and then I tell the people in Mexican. There will be no difficulty at all. Cortez and the Spaniards know that I love them, and they trust me altogether. I am able to do good to my country people, and to intercede with them sometimes with Cortez. Now tell me what has happened since I last saw you."" Malinche shuddered, ""It is terrible--these sacrifices. I rejoice that the white men will destroy these horrible idols and teach the people to worship the great God and His Son.

Gentlemen, we have a new companion to congratulate ourselves on. He is not only big and strong but also brave, making him a valuable comrade. Roger shared his knowledge of Mexico, mentioning its vast population and the challenges of entering the capital. Marina was instructed to provide him with clothes and armor, turning him into a true cavalier. Equipped and ready, Roger spoke with Bathalda, expressing gratitude and sending messages back to Tezcuco. The Tlascalans, impressed by the Spaniards' valor, formed an alliance and offered their fighting force.

The departure from Tlascala was seen by all the people of the state who gathered to bid farewell to the white men and wish them luck. Cortez, cautious of the warnings he had received, decided not to enter Cholula at night. The Spaniards were impressed by the city's size and advanced civilization. They were welcomed with gifts and provisions. Cortez assigned Roger to provide insights about the terrain and towns. He instructed Roger to move around the city discreetly to gather information. Cortez assigned Juan and Pedro to accompany Roger and help him relearn his language.

At the moment, the main concern is not that. We are unsure if the city's people are being deceitful towards us. They refuse to talk in front of Donna Marina or the Father because they understand the language. However, they assume this tall Spanish soldier doesn't understand them, so they freely share their thoughts. His task is to roam the streets, gather their opinions about us. Juan gladly agrees to this task. They plan to help him learn Spanish. Despite his different appearance, they find him honest and strong. Roger, eager to join, shakes hands with the soldiers. They discuss how the locals view them openly, unaware that Roger understands. The Mexicans find the Spanish soldiers impressive fighters but are surprised by their lighter skin.|"[""1.

Roger overheard some comments suggesting that the locals believed Montezuma allowed the strangers in to harm them. However, the defeat inflicted on Tlascala pleased the people more than any hostility towards the strangers. Cortez acknowledged Montezuma's animosity and warned of potential treachery. Marina and Roger were relied upon to shield the group from harm due to their knowledge of the local language. Cortez had Marina stay with a noble's wife for safety. Despite waiting for Montezuma's embassy, the locals remained courteous. Pedro was pleased with Roger's addition to the group, hoping the young man's cheerful spirit would lift their moods.

The following day, a noticeable change occurred in the behavior of the locals towards the Spanish. They avoided the Spanish quarters and the nobles declined invitations to see Cortez, citing illness or impending journeys. Roger and his friends also observed a shift in the people's demeanor on the streets. The usual chatter ceased, and individuals turned away upon their approach. The priests displayed disdain, and at times, they were pushed roughly. Cortez warned them against engaging with the locals to avoid conflict. Juan suspected treachery and sent Cempoallans to investigate. Barricades were found in the streets, and preparations for an attack were uncovered. Marina, befriended by a Cholulan woman, learned of a conspiracy orchestrated by the emperor to eliminate the Spaniards. The situation grew tense as an imminent assault was planned.|"['1.

In her apartment in the Spanish quarters, Marina learned of a treacherous plot against Cortez and the Spaniards. She quickly informed Cortez of the danger. The cazique's wife, in fear for her life, confirmed the plot. Cortez, realizing the gravity of the situation, sought further confirmation from priests. The priests, after receiving valuable gifts, confirmed the treachery. The Aztecs planned an attack on the Spaniards in Cholula. Cortez decided to leave the city the next day. He gathered his officers and discussed their options. Some suggested retreating to Tlascala, while others proposed an alternative route. Cortez, however, believed their best chance was to confront the threat boldly. He then met with Cholulan nobles, who agreed to provide assistance. Cortez also confronted Montezuma's ambassadors, accusing Montezuma of treachery. Despite their protests, Cortez maintained his suspicions. To prepare for a possible attack, Cortez took defensive measures, ensuring his troops were ready for any threat that might come during the night.|"[""1.

At dawn, the troops were ready for action. Some soldiers and guns were positioned outside to secure the streets, while others guarded the entrance gates. The remaining troops assembled in the central courtyard, enclosed by buildings and walls. The caziques, leaders of the Cholulans, arrived with more men than agreed upon. Cortez confronted them, revealing his knowledge of their treachery. Without warning, a gunshot initiated a fierce attack on the Cholulans. The natives, caught off guard, attempted to flee but were met with resistance. The Mexicans outside rushed in but were met with strong Spanish defense. The Tlascalans, allies of the Spaniards, joined the battle, overwhelming the Mexicans. A final stand was made at the temple, but the Cholulans were defeated. The town was set ablaze, and after the plunder, Cortez ensured the safety of the survivors.|"['1.

Cortez wrote to Emperor Charles that 3000 people were killed, but most historians believe the number was closer to 6000 or even higher. Order was restored quickly, and the residents returned to the town while locals brought supplies. The markets reopened, and only the charred remains reminded of the recent violence. The massacre was a stain on Cortez's record, although he treated the natives well during the campaign. Roger fought outside the gates, feeling pity for the locals despite the conflict. The Spaniards' brutal response in Cholula intimidated the Mexicans, who sent gifts and messages of submission. Montezuma realized the futility of resistance against the Spaniards. Cortez attempted to convert the city to Christianity but was advised against force by Father Olmedo. As they moved forward, Cortez received friendly messages from various towns on the plateau. The people welcomed the Spaniards as liberators from Aztec oppression. Cortez, seen as a kind protector, gained the trust of the natives, who viewed him as a safeguard against Montezuma's tyranny.|"[""1.

Upon reaching the blocked roads, Cortez ordered the obstacles removed. The army continued on the level road, feeling confident in their ability to defend themselves if attacked. During the march, Roger alternated between walking with Juan and Pedro and Malinche, who had a warm feeling for her former friend despite her loyalty to Cortez. Cortez often sought Roger's advice on the upcoming roads and places due to doubts about the native descriptions' accuracy. As they crossed the plateau and ascended steep hills towards Mexico, the cold and transporting heavy guns posed challenges. With the native allies clearing the way, the Spaniards remained alert for potential attacks. The sight of Mexico's vast cities stirred unease among the soldiers, leading to doubts about continuing the march. Cortez's leadership and persuasion reignited their determination, and the army descended into the valley, where they encountered the ruler of Mexico, dominated by superstitious fears, seeking divine protection against the Spanish invaders.|"['1.

The Spanish army moved slowly, pausing at Amaquemecan for two days, where they were warmly welcomed and gifted gold. Continuing to Ajotzinco, a town on Lake Chalco, they found canals instead of roads. The King of Tezcuco, as an ambassador, approached with a grand procession. Cacama, the prince, greeted Cortez with respect and gifts, expressing the emperor's welcome. After the exchange, Cacama returned to Mexico, and the army proceeded. Roger, aware of potential suspicion, delayed meeting the prince until later. The army then journeyed to Iztapalapan, welcomed by Cuitlahua. They were treated to a banquet and toured magnificent gardens. The next day, they marched towards the capital on a grand causeway, marveling at the floating gardens and the beauty of the surroundings. They encountered the fort of Xoloc and were greeted by nobles before continuing towards the city gate.|"['1.

As they walked, a grand procession came into view. First, three important state officials carried golden wands, followed by the emperor in a luxurious palanquin, held up by nobles, under a canopy of feathers and jewels. Montezuma stepped down and, still sheltered by the canopy, approached Cortez with his brother and nephew. Cortez, accompanied by his officers, met the emperor with respect, thanking him for the lavish gifts. They proceeded through the city, marveling at the splendid buildings, noble residences, and vibrant marketplaces. The grand temples and pyramids stood tall. The streets were lined with amazed onlookers, admiring the Spaniards and their Tlascalan allies. Crossing canals on bridges, they reached a square. The soldiers were housed in Montezuma's father's palace, fortified and guarded. The emperor visited, gifted the Spaniards, and departed. Cortez reciprocated the visit the next day, discussing Christianity with Montezuma, who politely declined to convert. The palace was vast, adorned with fountains and rich decorations. Montezuma believed the Spaniards were descendants of a god from the east, linking their arrival to Aztec prophecies.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Montezuma do when he approached Cortez with his brother and nephew?\nA) He challenged Cortez to a duel\nB) He gave Cortez a map of the city\nC) He thanked Cortez for the lavish gifts\nD) He ignored Cortez and walked away\nE) He asked Cortez to leave the city', ""Question 2:\nWhat did the soldiers do when they reached the square?\nA) They started a battle with the locals\nB) They set up a marketplace\nC) They rested and relaxed\nD) They built a temple\nE) They were housed in Montezuma's father's palace"", ""Question 3:\nWhat did Montezuma do when he visited the soldiers in his father's palace?\nA) He declared war on them\nB) He gifted the Spaniards\nC) He asked them to leave immediately\nD) He stole their weapons\nE) He imprisoned them"", ""Question 4:\nWhat did Cortez do the next day after Montezuma's visit?\nA) He declared himself the new emperor\nB) He left the city\nC) He discussed Christianity with Montezuma\nD) He started a rebellion\nE) He built a new palace"", ""Question 5:\nWhat did Montezuma believe about the Spaniards' arrival?\nA) They were aliens from another planet\nB) They were descendants of a god from the east\nC) They were spies from a neighboring kingdom\nD) They were lost travelers\nE) They were traders"", 'Question 6:\nWhat did the grand temples and pyramids symbolize?\nA) Wealth and power\nB) Poverty and oppression\nC) Peace and harmony\nD) Ignorance and superstition\nE) Education and progress']"|"['C) He thanked Cortez for the lavish gifts', ""E) They were housed in Montezuma's father's palace"", 'B) He gifted the Spaniards', 'C) He discussed Christianity with Montezuma', 'B) They were descendants of a god from the east', 'A) Wealth and power']"
The Spaniards were warmly welcomed in the city by the locals, but they couldn't ignore the potential dangers surrounding them. The city was like a fortress with canals and movable bridges, making escape nearly impossible. Montezuma, the emperor, had disguised his animosity towards them, despite his efforts to prevent their arrival. Roger sought permission to visit friends in Tezcuco, a city with potential to be an ally. The general confided in Roger about hostile natives and the recent battle at the coast, hinting at Montezuma's treacherous schemes. Concerned about potential danger, Roger was advised to go in disguise to gather information from the Tezcucan king. This covert mission could reveal the true intentions of Montezuma and safeguard them from impending threats.|"['1.

Marina, unlike the Spaniards confined to the palace, easily arranged for a canoe. Roger, disguised as an Aztec cazique, paddled through the crowded lake to Tezcuco. He instructed the natives in the canoe to wait for his return and proceeded to the palace. Avoiding attention due to his height, he reached Cuitcatl's apartment. Recognizing Roger's attire, the attendant welcomed him warmly. Cuitcatl expressed relief at Roger's safe return after the emperor's anger over his escape. The priests sought a white man's sacrifice for protection against invaders. Roger's feats in the hills and fight against Aztec soldiers spread, causing anxiety. Bathalda's return with news of Roger joining the white men calmed fears. Cuitcatl understood Roger's need for disguise due to the priests' fury.

Since your departure, things have been peculiar. I've mostly been in the capital. The news about the white people's progress surprised and worried everyone. The council met daily, but Montezuma spent his time with the priests, consumed by superstition. I respect our gods but believe one should think independently. Montezuma, however, relies heavily on the priests, causing indecision. We should have treated the strangers honorably from the start but failed. They were laden with gifts but barred from here. Despite orders, we seemed fearful upon their arrival. The plan to harm them at Cholula is disgraceful. The gods' prophecies were wrong, questioning the power of the white God. Roger warned of the Spaniards' cruelty and religious imposition. Cortez likely seeks riches, religious expansion, adventure, and honor. He may report back and receive more forces. Cortez is uneasy, unsure of Montezuma's plans, and apprehensive about an attack. He asked me to gauge opinions on the Spaniards. Ignorant opinions are deemed worthless by Cacama.|"[""1.

Among the nobles, priests, and scholars, opinions differ. Currently, we wait, but a storm may soon follow this calm. The priests, hostile to the strangers, hold significant power. Despite potential danger, it's safer to stay here for now. Montezuma, insulted and humiliated, may soon turn against the Spaniards. Cacama insists Roger stays and sends a message to Cortez. Roger talks with Cacama's family, explaining his acquaintance with Malinche. He learned the language from a Mexican slave girl. He sought Malinche's help to blend in with the Spaniards. Roger stayed cautious to protect his identity. He discussed the strategic move made by Cortez and the Tlascalans.|"['1.

Cacama, a thoughtful and prudent man, spoke to Roger, acknowledging his courage and strength. He inquired about the treachery at Cholula, suspecting the emperor's involvement through the priests. Roger confirmed the intended treachery, learned from a lady and two priests, supported by the Cholula nobles' admission. Cacama expressed concern about the emperor's blind trust in the priests, fearing further treachery. To ensure Roger's safety, Cacama suggested accompanying him to Mexico due to potential threats. They crossed the lake swiftly in a royal messenger canoe, reaching the Spanish-occupied palace.

Cortez and his men were in a precarious situation, with dangers lurking at every corner in the unfamiliar land of the Mexicans. As Roger prepared to leave for Tezcuco under Cacama's invitation, the group faced potential threats. Cortez, recognizing the risks, entrusted Sancho with a crucial task in case of their demise. The journey to Tezcuco was shadowed by a pursuing canoe, but Cuitcatl, with his quick thinking and skilled paddlers, managed to outpace their pursuers. The tension rose as the officials in the trailing boat shouted orders to stop, but Cuitcatl remained resolute, knowing they were acting under their king's commands.

"""Take the boat to the side with the others,"" Cuitcatl instructed the rowers. ""Then return home quietly without revealing our journey. The officials will discover what they need to know about us; they won't be concerned about individual rowers. It's best to stay silent."" Cuitcatl assured Roger that his return would soon be noticed in the palace due to his familiarity with many townspeople. Roger agreed, understanding that his identity couldn't be hidden. Later, Cacama expressed interest in Roger's archery skills. A bow was crafted to match Roger's strength, impressing the artisans. Roger effortlessly strung the bow, showcasing his expertise. They joined young nobles practicing archery, where Roger displayed his skills openly for the first time, no longer needing to hide his prowess after the Spaniards had proven the might of white fighters to the Mexicans."|"[""1.

As soon as he approached with Cacama, the Mexicans stopped their game and gathered around. They had heard whispers of the defeat of Montezuma's soldiers by the white man and were curious about the mighty bow Roger now possessed. The Mexicans passed the bow around, trying to bend it in disbelief. The bow was tall and wide, painted white, and supported by a hinged leg. Roger showcased his archery skills by hitting a target with precision, amazing the onlookers. He then demonstrated the bow's power by shooting arrows that struck the target accurately even at a distance of a hundred yards. The Mexicans were in awe, and Roger's final shot, which hit a tree over two hundred yards away, left them astonished and silent.|"['1.

Roger explained that the arrow hitting the tree was accidental. He demonstrated the strength of the bow, suggesting that his people practice archery daily. He proposed a monthly competition to encourage interest in the sport. Cacama admired Roger's strength and suggested hanging the bow as a prize for the first to draw it like Roger. Cacama offered Roger his sister Amenche's hand in marriage, believing she loved him. Roger was surprised but considered the offer, realizing the dangers he faced and the potential for a new life in Mexico.

Yet, I cannot predict my feelings forever. The love for my homeland might one day call me back to England. Cacama assured me that Amenche is willing to sacrifice her home for our happiness.

Three days later, Roger sat with Cuitcatl when an attendant hurried in, announcing the king's urgent summons. They quickly made their way to the royal apartment where Cacama paced angrily, the queen and princess looking pale and anxious. Cacama shared troubling news from Mexico - Montezuma, the emperor, had been seized by the white men, causing chaos in the city. Cortez, the Spanish leader, felt threatened and called a council of officers to strategize. Instead of retreating, Cortez proposed a daring plan: to bring Montezuma to their quarters as a hostage. The next day, Cortez confronted Montezuma, coercing him to come with them. Despite initial resistance, Montezuma relented, fearing for his life. The Mexicans, alarmed by the news, almost rebelled but refrained, allowing Montezuma to be taken captive by the Spaniards.|"[""1.

The bold and treacherous actions of Cortez towards Montezuma, the Aztec monarch, have stirred feelings of dishonor and betrayal. Montezuma, under the influence of priests, faced a difficult situation with the Spaniards holding him hostage in his own capital. While some suggest taking up arms against the invaders, others question Montezuma's intentions and leadership. The lack of faith and honor displayed by the Spaniards in seizing Montezuma, who had shown them generosity and trust, is condemned as a heinous act of ingratitude. The debate continues on whether to confront the Spaniards or to understand Montezuma's motives, as the fate of the nation hangs in the balance.

Three or four days later, another event occurred that angered the Mexicans against the Spaniards even more. The chief who had led the attack on the Spaniards arrived in Mexico with his son and fifteen other chiefs who had joined him. Montezuma asked Cortez to investigate the matter. The chief admitted his role in the attack and did not seek protection under royal authority. However, when they were sentenced to death by burning, they claimed they acted under Montezuma's orders. Cortez then put Montezuma in chains, convinced of his guilt. After the execution, Montezuma was released. This news deeply affected the Mexicans, leading some to believe that Montezuma's weakness was humiliating the nation. They felt the need to overthrow the oppressors, even if it meant risking Montezuma's life.|"[""1. What event angered the Mexicans against the Spaniards even more?\nA.

We need to closely monitor Cacama's actions as he is plotting against us by forming a league with other nobles to rescue the emperor and eliminate the Spaniards. Despite some nobles hesitating due to the absence of orders from the emperor, Cacama proceeded with his plan. Cortez, aware of the situation through spies, considered marching against Tezcuco but was advised against it by Montezuma due to the anticipated resistance. Negotiations failed, leading to a haughty response from Cacama. Montezuma's behavior towards the Spaniards further alienated him from his people. Eventually, Cacama was betrayed by Tezcucan nobles and captured. Despite his noble conduct, he was imprisoned by Cortez. Roger, learning of Cacama's fate, sought Malinche's help to spare his life, who assured him that Cacama would be spared, but other involved chiefs would be imprisoned.|"[""1.

Upon his arrival, Cuitcatl was shocked to hear that Montezuma had betrayed his own nephew, Cacama, who had been trying to save him. Cuitcatl was speechless with anger, feeling that the gods had abandoned them. He feared that Montezuma's actions would lead to more betrayals among their people. Cuitcatl offered his house as a safe haven for Princess and her companions. He suggested they leave discreetly to avoid any trouble. Cuitcatl planned to prepare litters and porters to ensure their safe departure. He advised Princess to take valuable jewels to use as leverage to help Cacama.

Cuitcatl departed. The queen instructed the two ladies chosen to accompany them to prepare for their escape. The queen and princess decided to leave the palace due to the news of Cacama's arrest. They gathered their jewels and clothes in bundles, ready to flee. The palace was deserted, with courtiers fleeing upon hearing the news. The queen led Roger to the royal treasury, revealing hidden rooms filled with treasures. They carefully packed valuable items into bundles for easy transport. Roger suggested disguising the treasures to avoid suspicion. The queen agreed, and they prepared the bundles to be carried discreetly.

Roger carefully closed the treasury's copper door, tidied up every speck of plaster, and smoothly returned the cabinet to its place, securing it with a click. It was so securely fixed that even Roger's strongest efforts couldn't budge it. Satisfied with his work, he rejoined the waiting ladies. The attendants were then called to help carry down bundles of clothes and valuable gold ornaments wrapped in rugs. Roger also took a small parcel of jewels. With everything packed, the group made their way downstairs and out to the garden. Roger reassured the ladies about their uncertain future, expressing hope for a happy outcome. As they left the gardens, they found litters ready. They boarded, and the valuables were stowed away. Roger guided the boatmen across the lake towards Mexico City, timing their arrival to coincide with the market boats.

I believe he will not worry about them. After taking Cacama's place, he would not want Cacama's wife there. Malinche guided them to the prison where Cacama was held. The guards let them pass as they knew her influence with Cortez. She and Amenche decided not to wait for the usurper and left secretly with Cuitcatl to his house. The queen took gold and jewels to offer bribes if needed. Cacama wished to punish the treacherous nobles. The queen wisely took valuables from the secret treasury. Roger assured Cacama that the entrance was safe. Bathalda would act as a messenger between Roger and Amenche. Cacama advised against stirring up false nobles.

Cacama's prediction quickly came true; within days, Montezuma ordered the arrest of all nobles involved in the uprising, including Cacama, who were imprisoned in chains. Bathalda visited Roger, reporting the safe arrival of the two ladies at Cuitcatl's house. The queen was eager for news from Cacama. Roger delivered Cacama's message to the queen and gave Bathalda flowers and sweet treats for Amenche. Tensions rose as the Spanish demanded vast treasures from Montezuma, aggravating the Mexicans further by trying to convert them to Christianity. The Spaniards took over a temple, causing unrest among the locals. Montezuma warned Cortez of danger and agreed to help build ships for the Spaniards to leave.

Upon reaching the coast, they discovered the truth about Cortez's conquest in Mexico. Narvaez, feeling indignant that the honor and wealth went to Cortez instead of Velasquez, decided to march against him. The troops of Cortez in Villa Rica were prepared for defense, and a small group was dispatched to inform Cortez of the threat. Narvaez's soldiers arrived, intending to punish Cortez, but the troops in Mexico remained loyal. Cortez managed to turn Narvaez's messengers into allies and sent them back with a plea for peace.

Under Olid, a group attacked the cannons, seized them, and aimed them at the temples where the soldiers stayed. The troops, swayed by Cortez's promise of forgiveness and rewards, switched sides. After pledging loyalty to Cortez, they merged with his army. When they saw Cortez's small force, some regretted their choice, but the arrival of two thousand allies from Chinantla reassured them. Cortez returned their spoils and distributed money. Cortez dispersed his troops, sending groups to form settlements, dismantle a fleet, and address an uprising in Mexico. Despite challenges, they reached Tlascala, where more troops joined. They then headed towards Mexico, encountering resistance and treachery along the way.

The soldiers followed his orders and retreated from the attack, setting up defenses around the area to starve out the Spaniards. The Spaniards had food supplies, but suffered from thirst until they discovered a spring. This allowed them to hold on until Cortez arrived. Cortez refused to meet with Montezuma, suspecting his loyalty due to Montezuma's contact with Narvaez. The people's patience wore thin due to the invaders' greed, disrespect for their beliefs, and the massacre of their nobles during a religious ceremony. The people no longer respected Montezuma, seeing him as a traitor. Cuitlahua, Montezuma's brother, took charge and organized an attack against the invaders, while Roger expressed concern for both the natives and the precarious situation they were in.

When Roger discovered that orders had been issued for a massacre at the temple, he resolved firmly that he would not take part in the act, regardless of the consequences of his refusal. Luckily, he had no trouble convincing a soldier assigned to guard the palace during the absence of the others to switch places with him, as the man desired a share in the anticipated spoils. If Cacama had been free, Roger would have joined the Mexicans without hesitation. However, with that option closed, he felt trapped. He feared the enraged populace would seize any white man outside the palace walls and offer him as a sacrifice to their gods. He regretted returning from Tezcuco, realizing that staying with his friend Cuitcatl would have shown he had no part in the impending massacre. Now, he believed the Mexicans would storm the palace before Cortez's return, and he doubted the general's ability to quell the insurrection swiftly.|[]|[]

I admire Cortez for his greatness and generosity. His people, however, display cruelty and greed for wealth. Despite my efforts to help my people, I fear they will curse me for siding with the invaders. The recent massacre was a treacherous act that even I, as a white man and Christian, condemn. The Mexicans, who make wars to sacrifice victims to their gods, will not easily forgive this betrayal. The Spaniards may underestimate the bravery of the Mexicans, who fought valiantly in the recent attack. As tensions rise, I feel torn between loyalty to the Spaniards and the fear of being sacrificed by the Mexicans. The city remains silent, with the Spaniards confined within the palace, hoping for a peaceful resolution.

In just thirty minutes, the messenger returned swiftly, wounded in many places. He brought news that the city was in an uproar, the drawbridges were up, and the Mexicans were marching towards the palace. Soon after his arrival, the sentinels on the towers warned of masses of men approaching from all streets leading to the palace. The terraces and roofs nearby were filled with natives shouting and waving weapons. The trumpet sounded for battle, and every soldier quickly took their position. The palace was defensible against a large enemy without artillery due to its strong wall and turrets. The Aztecs advanced with battle cries, raining down missiles. The Spaniards fired cannons through embrasures, causing heavy casualties. The Mexicans tried to climb the walls but were repelled. The fight raged on until night, with the Mexicans eventually retreating. Cortez planned a fierce response the next morning, but was surprised by the organized and determined Mexican forces.

The large crowd surrounding the palace looked different from the day before when the Mexicans fought in their usual clothes or padded armor. Today, they wore only loincloths as their cotton armor was useless against the Spaniards' weapons. The chiefs stood out with their colorful clothes and metal breastplates over feather work. They had helmets resembling fierce beasts with feather plumes. As the assault began, the Spanish forces unleashed artillery and musketry, causing havoc. The Aztecs initially fled but regrouped behind barricades, fighting fiercely with arrows and stones. The Spaniards charged through, facing relentless attacks. Despite the Spaniards' astonishment at the Aztecs' ferocity, the battle raged on. The Aztecs, determined and unbroken, camped around the palace, ready for the next day's fight. Cortez, wounded, realized the Aztecs' strength. As dawn broke, the Aztecs attacked again, forcing the Spaniards to defend desperately. Montezuma refused to intervene, torn by the conflict and losses suffered by his people.|"['1.

When the Spaniards promised to leave peacefully if allowed, Montezuma reluctantly agreed to speak to his people. Dressed in regal attire, he stood on the palace turret, guarded by Spaniards and Aztec nobles. The crowd fell silent and knelt before him. But when Montezuma assured them he was a guest, not a captive, of the Spaniards and ordered them to disarm, their reverence turned to anger. They hurled insults and missiles at him, causing him to fall unconscious. The Aztecs, initially indignant, later mourned his fall, dispersing quickly. Meanwhile, the Aztecs attacked the palace from the temple. Cortez led a failed assault, then with 300 men, fought his way up the pyramid against fierce Aztec resistance.

During the intense battle at the temple summit, both sides were fully engaged, leaving other areas silent. The combatants were fixated on the struggle, unaware of its outcome. Many fell over the unprotected edges of the platform during the fierce clash. The Spaniards triumphed by dethroning the Mexican god's image and setting the sanctuary ablaze. The Mexicans, disheartened by the defeat, offered no resistance as the Spaniards returned from the temple. Cortez, hoping to break their spirit, addressed the Mexicans the next day, but their resolve remained unshaken. One chief boldly declared that they were ready to sacrifice a thousand lives for every one taken by the Spaniards. The garrison, facing dwindling provisions and mounting casualties, felt deceived and trapped within their fortress, surrounded by relentless enemies.|"['1.

But the men who had served all along with Cortez remained resolute. They still had complete trust in their leader. The situation they found themselves in was not his doing but a result of others' misbehavior during his absence. They emphasized to their comrades that unity and obedience were the only ways to escape. Cortez, calm and composed as always in perilous times, found it harder to leave the city and abandon the treasures they had acquired than the soldiers did. He was more troubled by the potential displeasure of the emperor, the failure of his plans, and the loss of the kingdom he believed he had secured. However, he acknowledged that a retreat was inevitable as the defenses weakened, the soldiers grew weary, and food supplies dwindled. The challenge was deciding on the best route for retreat, which led to the construction of movable towers for an offensive move.|"[""1.

Cortez agreed to the priests' request to rescue them, but it was a ploy. The Mexicans wanted to save the priests, especially the high priest. While Cortez was having a meal, news arrived that the Mexicans had attacked fiercely. Cortez and his men fought back but faced overwhelming odds. Reports even spread that Cortez was killed. Eventually, Cortez managed to escape, which was seen as miraculous. That night, the Mexicans withdrew, and the Spaniards retreated to their citadel. Montezuma died that evening, refusing help and the Christian faith. Before his death, he entrusted his daughters to Cortez. The Spaniards mourned Montezuma's death despite past tensions. They believed he was sincere in his goodwill towards them. Cortez honored Montezuma's remains, and with his death, the Spaniards lost hope of reconciliation, leading to plans for a nighttime retreat.|"[""1.

The soldiers faced a dilemma about what to do with the treasure they had found. While Cortez's men followed his advice and only took a few valuable items, soldiers from Narvaez's group loaded themselves with as much gold as they could carry. Cortez organized the march with a vanguard and a rearguard, but a faulty plan with a single portable bridge caused delays and put the army at risk. As they left the fortress, the troops tried to move quietly, but were discovered by Aztec sentinels. The city woke up to the sound of war cries and drums. The soldiers faced a fierce attack as they tried to cross the causeway. Despite the chaos, they managed to get most of the column across the bridge, but it got stuck due to the heavy artillery. Forty men tried to move it but failed, leading to despair among the troops.|"['1.

"In the midst of a fierce battle, Cortez and his companions, including Sandoval, faced a perilous retreat. Pressed by the relentless Aztec warriors, they braved the waters of the canal. Some cavaliers managed to swim across, while others struggled and sank under the weight of their armor. The infantry, determined to follow, discarded their heavy gear to swim across. The fight continued on the causeway, with Aztecs attacking from boats and the shore. Cortez, leading the retreat, displayed exceptional courage by swimming his horse across the canal. Alvarado, with unwavering determination, made a daring leap across the gap using his lance as a pole.

The Aztecs did not pursue further, as they were busy securing the vast riches left behind by the Spaniards. Cortez, despite his tough exterior, couldn't hold back tears when he saw the remnants of his army. However, he found solace in knowing that many of his trusted companions, including Sandoval, Alvarado, and Marina, had survived. The retreat had taken a toll, with about 450 Spaniards and 4,000 Tlascalans lost. The soldiers were exhausted, but Cortez pushed them on, fearing an attack from the Aztecs. After a brief rest at a temple on a hill, the soldiers regained some strength.

As the conflict continued, Roger carried Cacama to safety in a canoe. Cuitcatl planned to bury Cacama properly and considered what to do with Roger.

Cuitcatl, acknowledging the bond between Cacama and a white man, urged haste in their departure.

"""We do not know that,"" Roger replied. ""Their position was a terrible one and seemed well-nigh hopeless. I know that Cuitcatl regarded it as quite hopeless, and deems that all have fallen; but I do not think so. The passages to be crossed were of no great width; and though numbers may have fallen, I believe that some will have made their way across. They will have lost their guns, and if the Aztecs continue to press them as hotly as they did upon the causeway, they may slay them all; but if they give them time to rally, they may yet fight their way back to Tlascala.""

Roger spoke to Cuitcatl about his uncertain fate after the Spaniards' destruction. He feared the priests' power and the tribes turning against any remaining Spaniards. Roger considered heading to the coast for escape, but doubted his chances due to the tribes' hostility. He pondered living in the mountains or joining a future Spanish expedition. The Spanish army, weakened and burdened with sick and wounded, began a perilous march. Attacked by natives, they struggled for food and faced exhaustion. Some soldiers fell to the enemy, while others succumbed to fatigue. The soldiers, once driven by gold, now discarded it to survive the harsh journey.

During the challenging days, Cortez led his soldiers with courage and cheer. Despite the increasing threats from the natives, Cortez remained at the front, facing danger head-on. He boosted the soldiers' morale with his calm demeanor and assured them of their potential escape from the looming dangers.

The Aztecs saw that the Spaniards were becoming exhausted, their horses struggling to carry them. They intensified their attacks, driving the cavalry back into the infantry ranks. Cortez, remaining composed, realized the urgency for change. He directed his men to target the Aztec leaders, knowing the importance of leadership. Spotting the noble officers around Cihuaca, the Aztec chief, Cortez led a fierce charge, breaking through the enemy ranks. Despite resistance, Cortez defeated Cihuaca, causing panic among the Aztecs. The Spaniards and their allies pursued the fleeing Aztecs, achieving a remarkable victory. The exhausted Aztecs, overwhelmed by fear, scattered in disarray. The Spaniards, grateful for their success, gathered the spoils and continued their march, halting at a temple for the night.

I heard loud cries from all over the field, but I didn't know what had happened. My men were in a panic, ignoring my shouts and orders, consumed by fear. I was swept away with them, feeling helpless like a leaf in a stream. The whole army was fleeing, chased by the whites and Tlascalans. Despite trying to rally a few men, we were overpowered. I managed to escape with Bathalda's help. Our leader, Cihuaca, was killed by the Spanish horse. The victory was already theirs, but panic spread among us like wildfire.

Roger received distressing news that Cuitcatl, Maclutha, and Amenche were arrested by Mexican officers for aiding a white man's escape. Roger felt helpless, unable to rescue them amidst the Aztec unrest. Despite his desire to return to Europe, faith in Cortez's leadership grew. Cortez's determination to march to Mexico strengthened Roger's resolve. As Cortez recovered, he defied soldiers' requests to retreat, urging them to honor their allies and the mission.

Before the ambassadors arrived, a strong faction in Tlascala, led by young chief Xicotencatl, opposed the Spaniards due to previous losses and the burden they posed. Xicotencatl urged unity with their own people instead of the Spaniards. Despite young warriors' enthusiasm, the four great chiefs, including Xicotencatl's father, resisted. Maxixca argued against the alliance, distrusting the Aztecs' intentions. Cortez, gaining trust in the Tlascalans, punished those who attacked his men, won battles, and prepared to move forward. He ordered the construction of ships at Tlascala to be carried to Lake Tezcuco for an attack. As preparations progressed, a smallpox outbreak devastated the land, claiming many lives, including Maxixca and Cuitlahua. Guatimozin succeeded Cuitlahua, continuing preparations for defense against the Spaniards. Cortez gained reinforcements from captured ships, preparing for the march towards Mexico.|"[""1.

Cortez's good fortune continued as a merchant ship arrived in Cuba with arms and military supplies, seeking to trade in Mexico. Cortez purchased the ship and its cargo, adding to his forces. By Christmas, Cortez's army was prepared to advance, consisting of six hundred men, including cavalry, musketeers, and crossbowmen, armed with nine cannons. Native allies, totaling from one hundred and ten to one hundred and fifty thousand, joined them. Leaving some allies behind, Cortez marched to Tezcuco unopposed. The Tezcucan prince, fearing his people's wrath, was executed by Coanaco. Cortez appointed a new ruler and had the Tezcucans dig a canal under his supervision. After conquering Iztapalapan, other cities submitted. Cortez then sent Sandoval with troops to escort completed ships from Tlascala. The ships were carried in pieces by an enormous escort to Tezcuco, marking a significant achievement.

The town of Xaltocan, located on an island, was the first target of the Spanish invaders. They faced initial setbacks as the dike leading to the town was sabotaged, causing great hardship. However, the Spaniards discovered a ford, conquered the town, and dealt with any resistance ruthlessly. Subsequently, they seized three deserted towns nearby. In their campaign against Tlacopan, they faced fierce battles, eventually taking control of the suburbs. Despite facing challenges, they managed to overcome the Aztecs in various encounters. Cortez, the Spanish leader, led his men through perilous situations, including a treacherous causeway ambush. Eventually, with reinforcements and newly built vessels, the Spanish forces set out on expeditions, facing fierce opposition in mountain fortresses and rich Aztec towns like Xochimilco. After a series of battles and narrow escapes, the Spaniards regrouped at Tezcuco, where they prepared to advance with a formidable force, including cavalry, foot soldiers, and artillery. A significant development was the completion of the canal and the launch of the ships, signaling a new phase in their conquest of the Aztec lands.|['1.

In the battle for Tlacopan, the Spanish divisions of Alvarado and Olid faced fierce resistance from the natives. The city's fresh water supply was cut off, and the invaders struggled to gain control of the causeway and bridges. Despite a long and intense fight, the Spaniards were forced to retreat with significant losses. However, Cortez's fleet turned the tide by attacking the native canoes on the lake. With the help of their allies, the Spaniards managed to breach the city's defenses and reach the central square. The Aztecs launched a ferocious counterattack, pushing the Spaniards back. But with the arrival of cavalry, Cortez rallied his troops and regained control, prompting many cities to submit to Spanish rule.

A simultaneous attack was launched, with the ships covering the advance along the causeway. The Spaniards faced fierce resistance as they re-entered the city, made easier by the destruction of buildings. Despite the obstinate natives, the great square was finally reached. Cortez set key buildings ablaze to intimidate but only further enraged the Aztecs. The Spanish troops faced relentless battles, retreating under heavy assault. The Mexicans repaired each night, challenging the Spanish control. Negotiations failed, and famine loomed. A plan was devised to take the market of Tlatelolco to unite the Spanish forces. Cortez, with support, cleared the suburbs, pushing towards the market. Divisions led by Alderete, Tapia, and Alvarado advanced through the city's streets towards the market.

The Aztec positioned himself at the opening, scanning the surroundings and checking on Roger's status. Late into the night, Roger heard the prearranged signal and swiftly freed himself from his restraints. Seizing the Aztec by surprise, he subdued him and secured his arms. With sword and javelin in hand, Roger proceeded towards the gate, where Cuitcatl and Bathalda awaited him. Cuitcatl expressed relief at Roger's freedom and offered a canoe for their escape. Roger assured Cuitcatl of his willingness to assist once the struggle subsided. Bathalda guided them to a boat, and they navigated through the waterways towards the Tlacopan causeway. Amidst the silence, Amenche, overwhelmed with joy, finally spoke up.|"['1.

The small canoe was not far behind, and the people on board suspected it might be a spy. When Roger leaped onto the boat, he swiftly defended himself against the attackers, striking down several natives. Despite being wounded, Roger's strength and size intimidated the rest, causing them to retreat. He and his companions rowed towards the causeway, avoiding enemy canoes. Upon reaching the shore, they were greeted by armed Spaniards. Roger identified himself as a friend who had escaped, and the Spaniards welcomed them. As they approached the causeway, Roger noticed Amenche was injured by an arrow. He carried her to safety through the ranks of the soldiers, who were engaged in battle. Marina, a woman in the fort, offered help as Roger brought Amenche inside. Cortez, the general, requested Roger's presence after learning of his return.|"['1.

"""It's good to see you back, Sancho,"" Cortez said to Roger. ""I heard about the sad event that happened to you. Marina mentioned the lady you rescued. She believed that the princess you loved, who is in the city, would try to save you."" Cortez asked about the other prisoners and the sacrifices at the temple.

"Roger followed Malinche into Amenche's room. Amenche lay still, pale and unconscious. ""Drink this medicine first,"" Roger said. ""We were in a boat, attacked by arrows. You were wounded, but I only realized it later. You were brought here, treated by a doctor, and have been resting."" Amenche recalled the attack and how Roger cared for her. The Mexican confirmed her improving condition. Malinche arranged for Amenche to stay with a Tezcucan chief away from the fort's chaos.

Before the final attack, Cortez once more tried to convince the emperor to surrender. He sent three Aztec nobles, captured in a recent battle, to deliver a message. Cortez explained that there was no hope left for the Aztecs. Their provisions were gone, their connections severed, and their allies had abandoned them. The surrounding nations were united against them. Cortez pleaded with the emperor to spare his people, who were dying daily, and their city was falling apart. He asked Guatimozin to accept Spanish rule to protect Aztec rights. The young king wanted to reject the terms but consulted his council. Many were in favor, but the priests reminded him of past betrayals by the Spanish. The Aztecs resisted all Spanish attempts to negotiate, leading to a brutal siege where the city was destroyed, and the population suffered from famine and disease. Despite their weakened state, the Aztecs refused to surrender, resulting in a tragic battle that claimed many lives.|"[""1.

After a long wait, the commander reluctantly restarted the attack, resulting in a brutal battle like the day before. Many Aztecs tried to flee in canoes but were blocked by the fleet. Amidst the chaos, there was a glimmer of hope as news arrived that Guatimozin, the Aztec leader, was captured along with his wife, Princess Tecuichpo, and other high-ranking nobles. Guatimozin faced Cortez with dignity, earning respect. Cortez allowed the survivors to leave unharmed, ending the resistance. The siege caused immense losses, with estimates ranging from 120,000 to double that number. The Aztec Empire's downfall was due to their oppressive rule over conquered territories, leading to their ultimate defeat by the Spaniards. Despite the destruction in capturing Mexico, Cortez treated prisoners with kindness and sought peace during the conflict.

Malinche informed Roger that she had spoken to Cortez regarding his desire to go to Europe after the fall of the city. Cortez agreed that Roger would be allowed to go to the coast with the wounded once the city fell. Cortez also consented to Roger's marriage to Amenche and promised her a portion of her brother's lands. Roger then spent time teaching Amenche about the Christian faith and they were married by Father Olmedo. Roger met Cuitcatl, who had been released by Cortez after helping Roger. Cuitcatl shared his plans to retire to his estates and get married. He believed that the Spaniards would eventually conquer the Aztecs, bringing stability to the region.

Roger and Amenche were on their way to Spain, with their fortunes changed by the treasures they had acquired. Amenche had sewn the most valuable jewels into a belt that she wore under her clothes. When Roger found it, he was glad to return it to her. The journey to the coast was made easier by native porters carrying the sick men on litters. The fresh air helped the sick recover, and by the time they reached the ship, Roger's strength was returning. Cortez had arranged for them to have a comfortable cabin on board. As they sailed to Spain, Roger's health improved, and he realized he was now a wealthy man. Upon reaching Cadiz, Roger exchanged his gold for Spanish coins and bought new clothes. They boarded an English ship, and the crew marveled at Roger's appearance. They set sail for England, where Roger's adventures were sure to continue.|"['1.

They spent a week in London, with Amenche enjoying the sights. After buying a horse and a sword for protection, Roger and Amenche rode to Plymouth. Six days later, they arrived in town. Roger visited his uncle, Diggory Beggs, who was initially hopeful but then accepted the loss of the ship. Roger assured him he could repay the lost money.
