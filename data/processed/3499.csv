""I couldn't sleep, so I imagined I was Folko, seeing Aslauga's hair shine in the sunset, the watchman's lamp, and the dawn light. My cell was high, offering a glimpse of the sky. Sometimes a star appeared, as beautiful as a face. I cherished that patch of blue, finding beauty in a passing cloud. I may have been a fool, but those thoughts helped me endure. I can't let them go.
