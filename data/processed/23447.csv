"""Halt your prisoners here, Corporal, and watch 'em until Captain Cortland gives his orders about them,"" directed Hal. Then the young sergeant turned down the street leading to officers' quarters, for the administrative office of the post had been closed for hours. ""Ray, you're officer of the day,"" broke in the post commander suddenly. ""Go out to Corporal Hyman and see that he turns Tomba and Cerverra over at the guard house. Instruct the sergeant of the guard to make absolutely certain that the prisoners have no chance to escape. Also, Ray, you will send Corporal Hyman and his four men back to Sergeant Terry.

Two young officers, Prescott and Holmes, commanded respect from their men at Fort Franklin. Captain Cortland announced that the prisoners were secured, and they would meet the next morning to discuss the situation further. Sergeant Hal found a shivering man in place of the prisoner, Tomba, who had escaped. Lieutenant Ray was puzzled as he had personally locked Tomba in the cell. Captain Cortland explained that a native had stolen the key, allowing Tomba to escape. To show military force, Lieutenant Holmes was tasked with leading thirty men to Bantoc, each carrying ammunition. The garrison prepared for potential trouble as they aimed to apprehend the escaped prisoner.|['1.

Sergeant Hal stopped speaking and swiftly walked down the road as the horse and rider approached. The horse was slowing down and eventually stumbled and fell just fifty feet away from the sergeant. Meanwhile, Edwards observed a group of marching men led by Lieutenant Holmes. A hospital steward rushed in with medical supplies since Fort Franklin lacked a resident surgeon. Despite encountering trouble in Bantoc, the bookkeeper managed to escape. Captain Cortland instructed Lieutenant Prescott to prepare sixty men for a mission to Seaforth's without delay. The men quickly assembled, equipped themselves, and stood ready for the upcoming expedition under the command of Lieutenant Prescott and Sergeant Overton.|"['1.

During conflicts in Mindanao, civilians stay indoors to avoid being mistaken for rebels by the troops. However, Uncle Sam's soldiers have no issues with peaceful citizens. The young lieutenant decided to slow the pace after three miles to ensure the soldiers are ready for combat upon arrival. The lieutenant noticed a red kite flying, signaling possible danger ahead, possibly an ambush. He instructed the soldiers to move quietly, avoiding unnecessary noise that could give away their position. A 'point' team led by Corporal Cotter was sent ahead to scout for any signs of trouble. As they neared the reported enemy, Sergeant Hal Overton felt a mix of excitement and unease, typical before a battle, wondering how his comrades were coping with the impending conflict.|"['1.

Lieutenant Prescott showed no signs of fear or concern on his face, maintaining a serious demeanor that reflected his strong sense of duty and responsibility. His West Point training was evident in his commanding presence. Newer soldiers, eager and inexperienced, revealed their novice status through their bright eyes and careful movements. The forest path, with its unknown dangers, instilled a sense of unease even in seasoned soldiers. Yet, armed and ready, each man felt a sense of pride in their ability to defend themselves against any threat. As they advanced cautiously, the real danger loomed ahead at the point of possible ambush. Lieutenant Prescott strategized silently, preparing to face the enemy head-on. The soldiers, now marching with renewed vigor, anticipated the impending confrontation with a mix of nerves and determination. The schoolhouse in the clearing, surrounded by armed Moros, became a focal point of tension as a sinister plan unfolded. The soldiers watched as the enemy set the building ablaze, a blatant act of aggression that spurred them into action.|"[""1.

Lieutenant Prescott addressed his men quietly, emphasizing the need for caution to avoid revealing their location. The group, led by Corporal Cotter, maneuvered through the woods towards the plantation. As they approached, gunfire indicated the ongoing conflict. Prescott directed his soldiers to deploy as skirmishers and advance across the field towards the enemy trench. The Moros, seen in the trench, intermittently fired towards the plantation. Recognizing the enemy's strategy, Prescott and his men prepared to flank the attackers. The soldiers, moving cautiously and crouched low, observed the Moros fleeing the trench as they fired back. The scene was chaotic, with the sound of gunfire echoing like a Fourth of July celebration. The Moros' retreat signaled a shift in the conflict dynamics.|"['1.

The bugle sounded, and the soldiers ceased firing. Bullets whizzed by as enemies from a grove fired upon them. Lieutenant Prescott, a brave officer, led his men towards the enemy's house. Despite the danger, the soldiers trusted their commander. Following his orders, they advanced cautiously, ready to drop to the ground if needed. As they moved, a volley of shots rang out. Private Danes fell, wounded but silent. His injury was severe, but he remained stoic, a true soldier. The bravery and trust between the soldiers and their officer were evident as they faced the enemy's fire.|"[""1.

Lieutenant Prescott faced a sudden burst of rifle fire, bullets whizzing around him. Despite the chaos, he remained composed, directing Hal to ensure the safety of their men. Seaforth, with gray streaks in his hair from his time in Mindanao, welcomed them warmly. Private Danes fainted but was quickly revived and treated for his wounds. The soldiers used a unique tool resembling a bayonet-trowel hybrid to dig trenches for cover. As the enemy Moros approached, Prescott spotted them and urged everyone to safety. Bullets flew, hitting Prescott's hat, grazing Hal's hand, and even splitting a stick in two. Despite the danger, they stood firm, ready to face the impending threat.|['1.

Lieutenant Prescott nodded in agreement, suggesting that a charge might be the best strategy against the Moros, despite their proficiency in close combat. The soldiers quickly formed a defensive perimeter around the building, with occasional shots fired by the Moros to unsettle them. The soldiers dug trenches and connected them to create a protective barrier within half an hour. As they worked, Hal Overton was reminded to keep his head down for safety. The soldiers were instructed not to engage in return fire unless ordered, allowing the Moros to waste their ammunition. Prescott then assigned men to fortify the main door of the house.

"""Goo-goos"" is a term used for Philippine raiders. When a local fighter wants to rest or gather information, they hide their weapons and pretend to be friendly when entering the American lines. This is why soldiers refer to all Filipino fighters as goo-goos. Hal Overton used a tool to peek at the distant grove where the Moros were hidden without exposing himself. Sergeant Overton mentioned they were not advancing, which was a relief. Mr. Seaforth explained that while most Moros are peaceful, some chiefs like Datto Hakkut cause trouble as they thrive on plunder. Mr. Seaforth refused to pay tribute to Datto Hakkut, preferring to fight for his plantation's freedom instead of being extorted yearly.

Mr. Seaforth suggested he could do better. He mentioned that his son secretly took a photo of the collector, which could help. The lieutenant and Overton discussed the situation, realizing the Moro threat was still present despite appearances. They decided to send two men to deliver a message to Captain Cortland. The men were advised to only carry essentials and to be cautious. The lieutenant then handed over command to Sergeant Overton for the night.

Once more, the Moros fell to the ground, losing many men. They hesitated, refraining from firing much as they were near the regular troops of Uncle Sam who were shooting consistently. It would have been dangerous for any Moro to expose themselves. Despite some wavering among the enemy, groups of fierce fighters armed with swords and knives charged forward. The regular soldiers found themselves facing multiple foes at once. Lieutenant Prescott shot one Moro, while Sergeant Hal saved him from another attacker. The noise of the battle temporarily deafened Hal, but soon he found himself wrapped in a blanket, fast asleep until the sun rose high. Prescott informed him of the plan to bring the white civilians to safety in town once the Moros retreated. Later, Hal would lead a group to scout the area for any hidden threats.|['1.

Lieutenant Prescott commended Sergeant Terry for his calmness and support, making his duties lighter. The situation in Bantoc was tense, with a potential for unrest and violence. Lieutenant Holmes was in charge there, possibly with Sergeant Terry. The military strategy of sending a small group ahead to draw fire and protect the larger force was discussed. As they ventured into the woods, the soldiers were cautious, aware of the enemy's tactics. Despite the tension, they proceeded safely through the forest, avoiding hostile encounters. After a thorough exploration near the Seaforth plantation, the soldiers received a signal about Datto Hakkut's movements towards the mountains. The loyal Moro laborers returned, providing valuable information to the team.|"['1.

Lieutenant Prescott politely scanned the natives but found no signs of recent military service. He decided to follow Captain Cortland's plan and return to Bantoc with most of his troops, leaving Sergeant Dinsmore and a few men behind. The white people from the plantation were urged to return to town for safety. As the column departed, Sergeant Dinsmore stayed with his squad. Upon reaching Bantoc, an escort arrived with two wagons, carrying the wounded and the deceased. Sergeant Hal was eager to reunite with his friend, Sergeant Noll Terry.

Lieutenant Holmes considered the challenges of policing all the Philippine Islands, pointing out that it would require a significantly larger U.S. Army. The current strategy of maintaining small forces across different locations and sending out expeditions when needed demonstrates to the natives that the U.S. takes them seriously. By engaging in small-scale attacks, the Army showcases the strength of even a few regular soldiers against native adversaries. William Green, known for his financial acumen, lent money to fellow soldiers. He recounted a cautionary tale of soldiers falling ill after a suspicious incident, highlighting the importance of vigilance. Sick call procedures were explained, emphasizing the role of the first sergeant in attending to the health needs of enlisted men.

Captain Cortland, troubled by the tragic loss of two young scientific gentlemen at the hands of the notorious Hakkut, a local troublemaker, felt compelled to take action. Determined to uphold American authority in Mindanao, he swiftly organized an expedition to track down Hakkut and his band in the mountains. With a limited number of troops available, Captain Freeman was tasked with leading the mission. Sixty men from B Company and C Company were selected, along with two officers to accompany each group. The expedition was to be equipped with a Gatling gun, wagons for ammunition and supplies, and field rations.

Captain Cortland had about sixty soldiers left to defend the post and maintain order in Bantoc. The soldiers knew they wouldn't return to Fort Franklin for weeks, and some might never return. Captain Freeman, equipped with military maps, led the troops through the mountains, where not all Moros were hostile. Friendly natives had shared the location of Datto Hakkut's forces, estimated at about eight hundred men. Despite not encountering the enemy in the first days, Captain Freeman remained confident. On the fourth morning, the troops moved cautiously through difficult terrain. Suddenly, a mob of Moros appeared, prompting the soldiers to fire back. The Gatling gun and infantry fire forced the natives to hesitate, but their leaders urged them to continue the attack.|"[""1.

"""Are the Moros cowards?"" asked a leader in a strong voice. ""Are they like women, afraid to face the joys of heaven? Why do you stay away for so long?"" The clash of swords filled the air as the Moros fought with bravery, skilled in using their swords and creeses. Despite their courage, the sound of the Gatling gun caused fear among the brown men. They tried to seize the gun but were pushed back by the bayonets of the soldiers defending it. The soldiers fired round after round into the Moro ranks until they could take no more.

Once the Gatling gun started firing, Sergeant Noll Terry bravely led the attack, inflicting many wounds on the enemy without getting hurt himself. Captain Freeman swiftly ordered Lieutenant Prescott to move the troops forward to safety. The Moro fighters were forced to retreat after suffering heavy casualties. The regulars, despite being outnumbered, gained respect for their courage. The soldiers fortified their position on a hill, ensuring the wounded were cared for. They dug trenches slightly below the hill's peak to avoid being easy targets. The day was hard-fought, with casualties on both sides.

Captain Freeman led his troops in a solemn ceremony, honoring fallen soldiers by reading prayers and firing volleys over their graves. The American flag, once desecrated by the Moros, was carefully preserved. The captain shared his strategy with his men, explaining a plan to lure the enemy into attacking their fortified position. By delaying combat, they hoped to weaken the enemy's morale and allow time for wounded soldiers to recover. The captain's goal was to provoke the Moros into multiple assaults, wearing down their forces before launching a decisive counterattack.

"Sergeant Hal and Noll were on a daring mission through enemy lines. As they stealthily navigated the gully, they remained vigilant for any signs of danger. The rain poured down, masking their movements. Hal signaled to Noll, indicating the path ahead was clear. Together, they inched forward, their teeth chattering from the cold and tension.

Whispering to Noll, Hal speculated that the gully might not be heavily guarded, as it seemed like an unlikely trap for the enemy. Moving cautiously, they bypassed a sentry without raising suspicion.

Hal and Noll, two Army boys, found themselves in a risky situation surrounded by Moro sentries. Despite the danger, Hal came up with a plan. He instructed Noll to stay close to a sentry until dawn and then rejoin the camp. If Hal led the expedition through a gully, Noll was to silence the sentry upon their approach. The Moro sentries seemed amused by the boys' antics in the storm. As Hal sneaked away, Noll distracted the sentry.

"""Forward!"" called the lieutenant. The soldiers charged ahead, but the news of the datto's death had already spread to his defenders. The regular troops easily took over, as the Moros had lost hope with their leader gone. The regulars quickly seized the datto's house, encountering little resistance as the remaining Moros surrendered in defeat. The Gatling gun at the gate halted any further attacks, but the Moros still lingered around the walls. A suggestion was made to display the datto's body to demoralize the enemy, which led to some of the Moros retreating with the body. Eventually, the Moros moved away, and the regulars held their ground. The troops alternated between guarding and eating breakfast from the fort's supplies.
