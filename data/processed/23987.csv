Laura paddled to the yacht with Anne after breakfast. Her father agreed to let her spend a month at the camp with Anne and Mrs. Royall. They lunched on the yacht before returning to camp, where the girls had gone berrying. Laura found the spontaneous activities charming.

"""I can't--O, I can't!"" she sobbed out, two big tears rolling down her cheeks. Then a vision of the little cottontail streaking across the road flashed in her mind, urging her on. Reluctantly, she continued, with dragging feet, passing untidy women and ragged children. Some begged for pennies, others threw stones. She ran past the settlement, shivering at the thought of returning. As she walked through the woods, a farmer offered her a ride, but she declined.

Elizabeth retreated to her cot, unable to sleep. Olga, feeling her gaze, turned away. The next morning, the girls headed to the water.

They continued their journey mostly in quiet until they reached camp. Elizabeth eagerly awaited their return, but Olga's cold look made her retreat to the Lookout alone. Laura attempted to engage Elizabeth in making a headband with colorful beads, but Elizabeth hesitated to try. Despite her persistence, Laura struggled to help Elizabeth overcome her fear of water. Each day, Elizabeth stood trembling in knee-high water, unable to go further. Olga, determined, made her wade daily, refusing to let her skip it. Later, Olga encouraged Elizabeth by showing her how she earned beads through simple tasks. Elizabeth's eyes welled with tears, but Olga's enthusiasm sparked a new energy in her.

Elizabeth gazed in disbelief at the offer of beads for doing simple chores. Olga insisted that Mrs. Royall would reward her at the Council Fire. She directed Elizabeth to drink milk, eat crackers, and relax until dinner. The girls engaged in a game where Elizabeth struggled, but Olga remained elusive.

Olga's determination pushed the Poor Thing to take a three-mile walk daily, which she eventually enjoyed. Adding another mile didn't bother her. The Poor Thing was happiest with Olga but felt inadequate for not being able to do tasks like beadwork and swimming. Despite this, Olga was pleased when she joined the walks. The Poor Thing found Slabtown settlement appealing, especially watching the children play. One day, they encountered a baby girl struggling on a stone wall. The boys refused to help until the sister intervened. The baby's arm was hurt, reminiscent of a past incident for Elizabeth. She decided to take the child to the doctor, facing skepticism from others. Elizabeth carried the child to the doctor, earning admiration from him for her efforts.|"[""1.

Miss Laura stood out from the rest. She didn't fuss over Jim like the others; she simply spoke to him in a kind way. Jim hoped she wouldn't forget her promise to visit again. Hospital hours felt endless, and Jim longed for company. When a group of girls entered, his eyes lit up as he recognized Miss Laura approaching.
