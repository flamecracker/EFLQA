This overview of Rome's history extends until the reign of Charles the Great, who led the new Western Empire. The narrative is concise yet detailed, aiming to captivate readers of all backgrounds. Let's now delve into the story of one of the most renowned nations globally. Moving westward from Greece, another peninsula juts into the Mediterranean. The Apennine Mountains form a limb extending from the Alps, shaping the land known as Italy. Numerous tribes settled in the fertile valleys formed by streams descending from the hills before written history explained their origins. Most of these tribes shared ancestry with the Greeks and spoke a language akin to Greek and Latin. The region's geography, including the Tiber River and the seven hills surrounding Rome, played a crucial role in the nation's development. The Etruscans, Sabines, and Latins were prominent tribes in the area, each with distinct characteristics and contributions to the region's rich history.|"['1.

Rome, an ancient city believed to have started as small villages with forts and temples, was home to gods like Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, and Janus. The people, known as Quirites, fought wars against neighboring tribes like the Sabines and Latins. They eventually enclosed the seven hills of Rome with a protective wall. The history of Rome, recorded by Titus Livius, includes tales of gods, heroes, and adventures. One such story tells of Æneas, a Trojan prince, who fled the burning city of Troy with his family and followers. After many trials and encounters, Æneas and his people found refuge in Carthage, ruled by Queen Dido. Despite Dido's kindness, Æneas was reminded of his destiny by the gods and had to leave, causing great sorrow to Dido, who tragically ended her own life.|['1.

Æneas landed in Italy at Cumæ where he met the Sybil, a wise virgin endowed with deep wisdom by Apollo. The Sybil told Æneas to visit the underworld of Pluto to learn his fate. To do so, he needed to find a golden bough in a forest for protection. After much searching, doves guided him to the tree where the golden branch grew. With the golden bough in hand, Æneas, guided by the Sybil, made his way through the underworld, crossing the river Styx and encountering various spirits. He met his father's spirit and saw the souls of his descendants, foretelling the glory of their name.

Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome, shaped the city almost into a square using a plough. He named it Rome, living in a mud-hovel among fifty families of the old Trojan race and numerous young men who had joined him. The city's supposed building date was A.D. 753, and Romans marked their years from it, known as A.U.C. Romulus faced challenges from neighboring nations, including the Sabines. To find wives, Romulus devised a plan during a feast where Roman men seized Sabine maidens, leading to a conflict. However, the Sabine women, who had become Roman wives, intervened, urging peace. This event united the Romans and Sabines into one nation, with Romulus and Tatius ruling together. After Tatius's death, Romulus reigned alone until his mysterious disappearance, believed to be taken by his father Mars or murdered by unknown assailants. Numa Pompilius, a Sabine, succeeded him, known for his wisdom and peaceful governance with guidance from the nymph Egeria.|['1.

Numa, a revered Roman king, ruled for thirty-eight years before his peaceful passing. Egeria, his mourning wife, transformed into a fountain. Following Numa was Tullus Hostilius, a fierce warrior who united Rome and Alba Longa through a combat between three Roman and three Alban brothers. The last Roman, Horatius, emerged victorious, but in his fury, mistakenly killed his sister. Despite Roman stoicism, Horatius faced punishment for the murder. Tullus Hostilius, though victorious in battles, offended the gods and perished in a lightning strike. Ancus Martius succeeded him, ruling justly. The Tarquin family, led by Tarquin the Elder, introduced innovations to Rome, including the first stone wall and a circus for games. Servius Tullus, Tarquin's son-in-law, succeeded Ancus after a deceitful plot by Ancus's sons.|"[""1.

"Servius Tullus was seen by the Romans as the one who started establishing their laws, just as Romulus had organized their military matters, and Numa had settled their religious practices. The Romans were divided into large clans with a single name, categorized into tribes. The more distinguished individuals, tracing their lineage back to ancient Trojan, Latin, or Sabine families, were known as Patricians, deriving from the term ""pater,"" meaning father, as they were seen as fathers of the people. On the other hand, families not of noble descent were referred to as Plebeians, originating from ""plebs,"" meaning the common people. The Patricians made up the Senate, rode horses in battle, while the Plebeians fought on foot. Servius Tullus established laws, fortified the city with a five-mile wall, and introduced regulations such as protecting debtors from being enslaved. He was a supporter of the Plebeians and initiated the rule that new Senate laws required the approval of the Comitia, the entire free populace."|"['1.

Rome was at war with the city of Gabii. Tarquin, unable to conquer it by force, resorted to treachery. His son, Sextus Tarquinius, fled to Gabii, alleging mistreatment by his father, displaying marks of harsh punishment. Gullible Gabians trusted him, granting him command of the army. Sextus sought advice from his father, who, without words, cut off poppies and tall corn stalks, signaling death. Sextus understood, orchestrating the exile or death of Gabii's leaders. The city fell to Rome. Tarquin's sons consulted the oracle at Delphi, learning the next ruler must kiss his mother. Brutus, feigning foolishness, kissed Mother Earth, foreseeing the oracle's meaning.

Tarquin, a Roman seeking to regain his throne, found an ally in the Etruscan king, Lars Porsena. Porsena led an army to besiege Rome, advancing towards the Janiculum gate. Horatius, Lartius, and Herminius bravely guarded the bridge over the Tiber against the Etruscan army, allowing their fellow citizens to retreat. Horatius fought alone until the bridge was nearly destroyed, then leapt into the river, sacrificing his eye and leg. Porsena blockaded the city, offering food in exchange for surrender, but the Romans refused. A young man named Caius Mucius attempted to assassinate Porsena but mistakenly killed a counselor. Impressed by Mucius's bravery, Porsena spared his life. Clelia and Valeria also played key roles in the conflict.

Tarquin, the last of Rome's legendary kings, lost his sons and died in exile. This marks the end of Rome's legendary history, where tales mix truth with fiction to explain Roman customs. The patricians, Rome's elite families, believed they alone had the right to govern. Plebeians, newcomers, had no rights initially and relied on patricians for help. The Senate, a council of patricians, held power. Plebeians, eager for inclusion, formed tribes with leaders to represent them. Every five years, citizens were counted and divided into centuries based on wealth. These centuries voted on peace and war in the Comitia, but patricians had more power. Magistrates, all patricians, were chosen yearly. Consuls led, followed by praetors, quaestors, and censors. Religion was crucial; priests were patricians, and the Pontifex Maximus was the chief priest. Romans were religious and wore white garments with purple edges. Boys wore a bulla until age seventeen when they transitioned to a toga, signifying readiness for battle. Legions composed of men from each tribe, led by centurions, were the core of Rome's military might, each bearing a standard with the emblem of Rome.|"[""1.

In ancient Rome, the Romans were not very wealthy. They owned small farms in the countryside and worked them with their sons and slaves. Surprisingly, the plebeians, who were often the richest, also leased farms from the state and ran small shops in Rome. The territory was so compact that it was easy for people to come into Rome for various activities. They would worship, attend the Senate, and vote. Many did not even have homes in the city. Roman matrons were highly regarded for staying at home and spinning wool. The Romans were known for their obedience to their fathers, officers, magistrates, and gods. There were constant struggles between the patricians and plebeians, with the latter often suffering from debt and harsh treatment.

This consul, Kæso Fabius, came from a clever family known for their cunning tactics. Originally named _Foveus_ due to their expertise in trapping wolves in ditches, the Fabii were staunch defenders of patrician rights. However, they eventually switched sides to support the plebeians. Kæso, as consul, tried to enforce the laws of Cassius but faced opposition. To serve his country, he and his kin volunteered to guard a watch-tower against Etruscan raids. Despite initial success, they were ambushed and slain, leaving only one survivor. Subsequently, tribune Publilius secured rights for plebeians. A consul, Appius Claudius, harshly punished plebeians, leading to conflicts. Claudius faced consequences for his actions, highlighting the ongoing struggles between patricians and plebeians amid external wars. In another conflict, Caius Marcius, later known as Coriolanus, displayed valor in battle and generosity during a famine. However, his disdain for plebeians led to his banishment from Rome.

Appius Claudius, a wicked man, saw a beautiful girl named Virginia reading in the Forum. He wanted her for himself but couldn't marry her due to Roman laws. So, he paid a man to claim that Virginia was a slave. They tried to take her, but her uncle intervened. Appius still wanted her, so he declared she was a slave. Virginia's father, Virginius, arrived and, seeing no other way, he tragically killed his daughter to save her from slavery. This act caused an uproar, and the people demanded justice. Appius was imprisoned and later took his own life. The incident led to changes in Roman laws, allowing patricians and plebeians to intermarry. The siege of Veii, a city at war with Rome, ended with the draining of the Alban lake, fulfilling an old prophecy. Camillus and Scipio led the Romans to victory, capturing Veii after a ten-year siege.|"['1.

Camillus, a Roman general, displayed excessive pride after his victory, claiming honors reserved for gods. He painted his face and rode in a chariot drawn by white horses, upsetting many. He promised a tenth of the spoils to Apollo but failed to deliver, causing further offense. To appease Apollo, a gold vase was sent to his oracle at Delphi. Camillus later led a successful siege against the Falisci, an Etruscan group. A schoolmaster betrayed the Falisci by bringing their sons to Camillus, hoping to avoid harm. Camillus, appalled by the treachery, had the boys punish the schoolmaster. The Falisci, impressed by Camillus' integrity, made peace. Meanwhile, Gauls from the North threatened Etruria, leading to Rome's vulnerability and eventual defeat by the Gauls at the Allia River. The Romans fled, leaving the Capitol as their last defense.|"['1.

When Rome was under attack by the Gauls, most of the city was abandoned, except for a small group of elderly senators who stayed in the Capitol to pray for the city's safety. The Gauls, amazed by the senators' calm demeanor, started to plunder the city. However, a brave man named Pontius Cominius managed to sneak through enemy lines, climb the Capitol, and bring back orders from the Senate. This act of courage inspired hope in the weary garrison. Eventually, with the help of Camillus, the Romans defeated the Gauls and saved the Capitol. The Gauls, suffering from sickness and weariness, dispersed, and the ransom of the Capitol was recovered. The Romans decided to rebuild their city, and in the ruins, they found important artifacts like Romulus's golden rod and the Laws of the Twelve Tables. Camillus, hailed as a hero, was likened to Romulus, another founder of Rome.|"[""1.

During ancient Roman times, a struggle emerged between the plebeians, who were common people, and the patricians, who were the wealthy elite. The plebeians were gaining ground and eventually secured equal rights with the patricians. This progress was driven by the efforts of Licinius Stolo and Lucius Sextius, who were elected as tribunes and pushed for reforms benefiting the common people. They fought for measures like debt forgiveness, land redistribution, and plebeian consuls. Despite opposition from the rich, these reforms eventually led to a more balanced power structure in Rome. The story of Marcus Curtius, who sacrificed himself to fill a chasm in the Forum, symbolized the courage and selflessness that the Romans believed would bring them success in battles. The Romans faced challenges from invading Gauls, but through the leadership of figures like Camillus and the bravery of individuals like Titus Manlius Torquatus, they were able to defend their city and gradually weaken their enemies.|['1.

During a battle against the Gauls, Marcus Valerius, known as Corvus, gained a victory with the help of a mysterious raven. The Gauls were defeated, and a new enemy, the Samnites, emerged. The Romans, led by Valerius Corvus, fought the Samnites after an entreaty from the people of Campania. In another battle, Decius Mus showed bravery by outsmarting the Samnites, allowing the Romans to escape. Decius later sacrificed himself for his country in a battle against the Latins. His sacrifice turned the tide of the battle, leading to a Roman victory. The story of these brave heroes teaches us about sacrifice, courage, and loyalty to one's country.|"['1.

In ancient times, Rome emerged victorious over the Latins, forcing them to surrender. Some cities kept their laws, while others became Roman colonies. The Latin people became Roman citizens but couldn't hold office. Neapolis, a city founded by Greeks, joined Rome. In 326, Publilius Philo was made proconsul during a siege. Lucius Papirius became dictator in 320 and punished Quintus Fabius for disobedience. Later, consuls Veturius and Posthumius were trapped by the Samnites in a narrow pass. Posthumius tricked the Samnites, regained honor, and returned to Rome. The Romans, in mourning, welcomed back their defeated soldiers. Revenge was sought, but a peace treaty complicated matters. Posthumius cleverly avoided being handed over to the Samnites, redeeming his honor.|['1.

A fierce battle took place where Pontius and his 7000 men surrendered to the Romans after a long struggle lasting seventy years. The Romans faced defeats but also fought other wars simultaneously. They never fully conquered Etruria. In a battle against the Gauls at Sentinum, Decius Mus sacrificed himself for victory, much like his father at Vesuvius. The Samnite wars concluded in 290 with Pontius Telesimus, Samnium's chief general, being captured and executed in Rome. While the open lands were under control, many Samnites remained in the Apennines. Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, came to Italy after Tarentum sought his help against the Romans. Pyrrhus brought a large army and elephants but faced challenges from the Tarentines and the Romans. The Romans, led by Fabricius, refused bribes and negotiated for peace, eventually securing the release of prisoners.|"['1.

Pyrrhus inquired, executed the physician, and freed the captives to seek peace with the Romans. However, the Romans rejected any terms except for Pyrrhus to surrender the Tarentines and retreat on his ships. A battle occurred in the Asculum woods. Decius Mus vowed to sacrifice himself like his father and grandfather, but Pyrrhus, upon learning this, ordered Decius to be captured alive and flogged, preventing his sacrifice. The Romans were pushed back by elephants' might but held until nightfall. Pyrrhus, wounded, and many Greeks fell. Pyrrhus then went to Sicily to aid the Greeks against the Carthaginians but returned to Tarentum unsatisfied. Marcus Curius Dentatus, a stern Roman, defeated Pyrrhus at Beneventum after nine years, forcing Pyrrhus to retreat to Epirus. Dentatus celebrated the grandest triumph in Rome, with elephants in the procession. The Romans conquered Southern Italy, including Tarentines and Sybaris, known for their idleness.

During the First Punic War, the Romans decided to build a fleet of war galleys after a Carthaginian ship wrecked on their coast. The Romans trained oarsmen on dry land and quickly put together a fleet of a hundred ships. Instead of traditional naval tactics, they devised new strategies involving heavy weights and drawbridges to board enemy ships. In a surprising attack led by the consul Duilius off Mylæ, the Carthaginians were defeated and chased to Sardinia. The Romans then sent an expedition to Africa under the command of Marcus Attilius Regulus. Despite facing challenges, Regulus landed in Africa and encountered a legendary serpent that was eventually defeated. The Romans continued to fight the Carthaginians, culminating in a victory near Panormus. After twenty-four years of war, peace was finally achieved, with Rome emerging victorious and imposing harsh terms on Carthage, leading to a deep-seated animosity between the two powers.|['1.

After the Punic war, Carthage faced trouble with its hired soldiers, allowing Rome to establish Sicily as a province governed by a proprætor. Syracuse, a Greek kingdom, remained an ally of Rome, while cities like Messina governed themselves. Eventually, Sardinia and Corsica were surrendered to Rome, leading to fierce battles and the enslavement of many natives. The Romans expanded their territory, subduing Cisalpine Gaul, and a great road, the Flaminian Way, was constructed. Marcus Claudius Marcellus emerged as a hero, defeating the Gauls. The Romans adopted Greek customs, seeking a statue of Esculapius, the god of medicine. Gladiatorial fights and divorce laws began to influence Roman society negatively. Meanwhile, Carthage expanded in Spain, with Hamilcar's son, Hannibal, growing up to become a formidable leader, sparking tensions with Rome.|['1.

The Romans were concerned about Carthage's aggressive behavior, leading to the outbreak of the Second Punic War. Hannibal, a brilliant Carthaginian general, devised a daring plan to march from Spain to Italy, aiming to gather support from Gauls and Italian tribes hostile to Rome. With a diverse army of foot soldiers, horsemen, and elephants, Hannibal crossed the Alps, facing harsh conditions and losses. Despite initial victories against Roman armies, he faced challenges due to lack of supplies and Roman resilience. The Romans, under various commanders, engaged in fierce battles, including the devastating defeat at Cannae. Hannibal's strategic maneuvers and Rome's internal struggles shaped the course of the war. The conflict continued as both sides sought allies and reinforcements, impacting the Mediterranean region.|"[""1.

During the Second Punic War, Hannibal, a skilled leader from Carthage, faced challenges in Italy. His brother Hasdrubal's attempt to reinforce him failed when he was defeated and killed by Tiberius Claudius Nero. Meanwhile, young Scipio achieved success in Spain, befriending the Iberians and gaining control of many towns. He proposed attacking Africa to drive Hannibal out of Italy. Scipio formed an alliance with Massinissa, the Moorish king, and alarmed Carthage. A decisive battle at Zama led to Scipio's victory over Hannibal. Carthage agreed to harsh terms, ending the war in 201 BC. Scipio, known as Africanus, returned to Rome to a grand triumph. He was a respected Roman who embraced Greek culture and learning. The Romans later engaged in a war in Greece to protect their interests and support their allies, like Philip of Macedon.|"['1.

"The Romans insisted that Hannibal should be dismissed by Antiochus, though Scipio declared this ungenerous. They feared his enmity and demanded his surrender from the king of Bothnia. Hannibal, worn and disappointed, ended his life with poison, freeing the Romans from fear. Eumenes of Pergamus received the territories from Antiochus, ruled as a Roman tributary. Lucius Scipio was named Asiaticus. Accused of taking too much from the spoils, Lucius tore his accounts, refusing to justify.

"During the third and final Punic war, Carthage faced continuous torment from the old Moorish king, Massinissa, who believed Phoenician strangers had no place in Africa. Despite Carthage's complaints of defenselessness, the Romans ignored them, hoping to provoke an attack on the Moors. Marcus Porcius Cato, after visiting Carthage, urged the Senate to destroy the city, symbolizing its proximity with fresh figs and the phrase ""_Delenda est Carthago_"" (Carthage is to be wiped out). Cato, who lived to ninety, resisted luxury and advocated against decadent lifestyles.

While Tiberius served in Spain, he devised a plan. Being plebeian, he aimed to be a tribune. Upon returning home, he stood for election and won. Tiberius proposed reviving the Licinian law, limiting land ownership to 500 acres and redistributing the surplus among the landless, favoring larger portions for those with many children. This stirred conflict; the rich opposed, bribing a tribune to block the law. Tiberius fought back and, with allies, was to enforce the law. False rumors of kingship led to his tragic death. His brother Caius, also a tribune, pursued similar reforms but faced opposition. Ultimately, both brothers met tragic ends due to their efforts for social change.

After the death of Massinissa, a king of Numidia and ally of the Romans, there were disputes among his grandsons. Jugurtha, considered to have the least right, became king. Caius Marius, a former Roman peasant turned skilled commander, was sent to face Jugurtha. Despite being disliked by the Senate, Marius, who married into the prestigious Cæsar family, always had the people's support. He formed an army with various recruits, changing the traditional Roman citizen-only approach. Jugurtha waged war against Marius in Africa but was eventually betrayed and captured. Meanwhile, Marius faced the threat of the Cimbri and Teutones tribes advancing towards Rome. In a fierce battle at Aquæ Sextiæ, Marius defeated the Teutones, preventing them from reaching Italy.

During a time of great unrest in Rome, Drusus, a noble citizen, was tragically murdered in the streets. This event sparked the Social War, where the Italians rebelled against Rome. Marius, a Roman leader, faced challenges as some Italian tribes sided with Rome and were granted citizenship. The revolt was widespread, leading the Senate to offer citizenship to Italians who sought it within sixty days. Citizenship under Roman law freed individuals from taxes and offered opportunities for advancement. Despite victories by Roman leaders, the revolt continued, with Marius facing opposition from his second-in-command, Sulla. Meanwhile, in Asia Minor, King Mithridates provoked conflict with Rome, leading to a brutal massacre of Romans. Sulla was tasked with avenging their deaths, while Marius faced his own struggles and exile, highlighting the complexities of power and loyalty in ancient Rome.|['1.

After Sulla left for the East, Rome spiraled into chaos. Opposing consuls Octavius and Cinna clashed, leading to Cinna's expulsion from Rome. Meanwhile, the Italians initiated a Social War. Marius seized the opportunity, gathering supporters and runaway slaves. The discontented Romans, along with the Samnites, marched towards Rome. Cinna, backed by the Senate, entered the city with Marius, seeking revenge. Chaos ensued as the slaves looted and violence erupted. Sertorius was called in to restore order. Marius and Cinna declared themselves consuls, bypassing the election process. Marius, aiming to confront Sulla in the East, passed away before his term ended. Cinna's attempt to challenge Sulla failed, resulting in his demise.

During the time of Sulla's rule in Rome, many faced danger, including Caius Julius Caesar, who defied Sulla's demands. Caesar fled to the Sabine hills, but his life was spared due to the intervention of his friends, especially the Vestal Virgins. Sulla aimed to restore the old government by committing atrocities to pave the way for the patrician rule. He made reforms, including enrolling Italians as citizens and granting freedom to slaves. After resigning as dictator, Sulla spent his final days in a villa near Rome. Meanwhile, Cnæus Pompeius, known as Pompey the Great, gained fame for his military victories. He was tasked with defeating the Cilician pirates, a mission he accomplished swiftly and effectively.

During this time, while the Roman Empire was expanding its territories towards the Euphrates River, a dangerous plot was brewing in Rome. Lucius Sergius Catilina, along with seven other nobles, conspired to arm the mob, including slaves and gladiators, to overthrow the government. However, their plan was foiled when one of the plotters confided in his lover, who then informed Marcus Tullius Cicero, a wise and honorable Roman consul. Cicero, a skilled orator and lawyer, exposed Catilina's intentions before the Senate. Catilina fled the city, but some of his accomplices were caught trying to involve Gauls in their scheme. Cicero ensured their execution, despite Julius Caesar's suggestion of lifelong imprisonment. Catilina's rebellion in Italy was crushed, and he was defeated and killed. Meanwhile, Pompeius returned to Rome in triumph, showered with accolades for his conquests.

"After conquering Gaul and making two trips to Britain, Julius Caesar returned to Rome to find chaos. Clodius had Cicero put on trial without a fair defense, leading to Cicero's exile. Pompeius, not helping Cicero, was chosen as sole consul to restore order. Meanwhile, Crassus faced defeat in Syria against the Parthians. Tensions rose between Caesar and Pompeius, leading to a civil war. Crossing the Rubicon, Caesar marched towards Pompeius, who fled to the south. Caesar won Italy in just sixty days, forcing Pompeius to flee to Egypt. Betrayed by the young king of Egypt, Pompeius was assassinated.

Nero started his rule well, guided by Seneca and Burrhus. However, his infatuation with Poppæa Sabina led to a series of violent acts. Nero ordered his neglected wife Octavia's death to marry Poppæa. He became more erratic, performing in public and accusing wealthy citizens to fund his lavish lifestyle. A devastating fire in Rome led to rumors that Nero had started it. To deflect blame, he targeted Christians, leading to the first persecution. St. Paul and St. Peter were among those arrested.

He and his son, also named Titus, were in the East, preparing to quell a major rebellion of the Jews. As events unfolded, old Galba's actions angered the soldiers, leading to a revolt against him. Subsequently, soldier Otho became Emperor, but Vitellius' legions from Gaul marched to depose him. Vitellius took his own life to prevent further bloodshed. Upon hearing of these events, the Eastern army proclaimed Vespasian as Emperor. Vespasian left his son Titus to conquer Judea and headed to Italy, where Vitellius was indulging in revelry. After fierce battles, Vespasian emerged victorious. Titus, meanwhile, laid siege to Jerusalem, where chaos and famine reigned. The Romans eventually breached the city walls, leading to a tragic end for the Jews. Vespasian and Titus, known as the Flavian Caesars, undertook significant building projects in Rome, including the construction of the Colosseum. Vespasian's reign brought stability and order after the erratic rule of previous emperors.|"['1.

Titus, a compassionate and scholarly ruler, was adored by his people for his kindness. His reign faced challenges, including a devastating fire in Rome and the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which destroyed Herculaneum and Pompeii. The philosopher Plinius lost his life during the eruption, narrated by his nephew, Pliny the younger. Domitian, Titus' brother, succeeded him but ruled as a cruel tyrant, blamed for persecuting Christians and forsaking Roman traditions. The Colosseum was inaugurated during Domitian's rule, hosting gruesome gladiator battles. Eventually, Domitian's reign ended tragically when his wife orchestrated his assassination. Nerva, a respected senator, took over as Emperor, attempting to revive Roman values and persecuting Christians who refused to worship Roman gods, leading to the martyrdom of St. Ignatius.|"['1.

During the time of the Roman Emperors, it is interesting to note that some of the Emperors known for their goodness were harsher towards Christians than the ones considered bad. The good Emperors, like Trajan, tried to bring back a simpler way of life inspired by history, while turning a blind eye to the Christians unless they were brought before them. Trajan, a great ruler and builder, expanded the empire and left a lasting legacy with his conquests. Hadrian, his successor, focused on defending the empire and was known for building the famous Roman wall in Britain. Marcus Aurelius, a philosopher, struggled with internal conflicts and allowed persecution of Christians during his rule. Despite his efforts, the empire faced numerous challenges like war, famine, and plague. After Aurelius, his son Commodus, known for his extravagance, led a turbulent reign until he was murdered. The subsequent chaos in the empire led to the rise of Pertinax, who faced challenges from the disorderly Prætorian Guard.|"['1.

In ancient Rome, the empire was once sold by the Prætorians at an auction to Didius Julianus, a vain and wealthy senator. However, the other armies across the empire did not agree to this sale, and each army chose its own general to march on Rome. The general from the Danube, Septimius Severus, was the first to reach Rome, leading the Prætorians to kill Julianus and join Severus. Severus proved to be a capable and active Emperor, maintaining order and building roads that connected the entire empire. He faced challenges from the Parthians and made significant improvements during his reign. After his death, his sons Caracalla and Geta took over, but Caracalla's cruelty led to his demise. Alexander Severus succeeded him, ruling justly and respecting virtue, although he did not embrace Christianity. The Prætorians played a significant role in the rapid rise and fall of Emperors during this period.|['1.

During the reign of Emperor Valerian, the Persian King Sapor defeated him in a battle at Edessa and made Valerian his prisoner. Odenatus and his wife Zenobia bravely resisted Sapor in Palmyra. Zenobia, well-versed in Greek philosophy, declared herself Empress after Odenatus' death. Aurelian, the Roman Emperor, later defeated Zenobia and brought her to Rome as a captive. Diocletian, a Dalmatian soldier, became Emperor after a prophecy involving a boar. He divided the empire into two parts, ruling the East while appointing Maximian to rule the West. Diocletian was just and kind, while Maximian was fierce and savage. Both had a strong dislike for Christians and initiated severe persecutions against them, except in Britain under Constantius Chlorus. The Christian martyrs endured torture and death in the face of persecution.|"[""1.

In 305, Emperor Diocletian celebrated a triumph at Nicomedia but fell ill soon after. At the age of fifty-nine, he decided to resign the empire while still strong. Constantius and Galerius became Emperors. Constantius stopped persecution in the West, while Galerius continued it in the East. Constantius bravely defended Britain and Gaul against enemies. He passed away in 305. Galerius appointed Licinius, but Constantine was proclaimed Emperor by Gaul and Britain. Old Maximian returned and allied with Constantine against his son Maxentius, who rebelled. Constantine defeated Maxentius and became Emperor of the West. He embraced Christianity, winning battles and defeating Licinius, becoming the sole Emperor in 323. Constantine favored Christians, improved laws, and built Constantinople as a Christian city. His mother, Helena, visited holy sites and built churches, which stand today.|['1.

During a time when many people claimed to be part of the Church but led worldly and wicked lives, some good individuals chose to live in solitude to pray away from temptation. These people were known as hermits, with St. Anthony being the first and most famous. The hermits in the hilly region of Thebaid in Egypt banded together and formed brotherhoods, becoming known as monks. Meanwhile, a priest named Arius in Egypt began teaching false beliefs about Jesus, causing a significant following. To address this, Emperor Constantine gathered 318 Bishops from across the empire for the Council of Nicaea. They declared the true faith in the Nicene Creed, affirming Jesus as God. Despite initial opposition, most Bishops agreed, marking the beginning of the Catholic Church. Constantine faced personal tragedies but ultimately embraced the true faith before his death.|['1.

During the reign of Emperor Constantius, a brave Catholic named James defended the city of Nisibis against the Persian king Sapor for four months. Constantius, a timid and jealous ruler, feared his cousin Julian, who was a successful military leader. Julian, upon Constantius' death, became Emperor and reinstated pagan practices, trying to suppress Christianity. Julian's attempts to revive paganism failed, and he grew bitter. Despite his kindness, Julian threatened persecution. He led an unsuccessful campaign against Persia, where he was mortally wounded. Before his death, Julian acknowledged Christ's victory. After Julian's death, the Romans chose Jovian as their new leader. Jovian made a treaty with Persia, ceding lands and surrendering Nisibis, causing sorrow among Eastern Christians. Jovian briefly reigned and recalled Athanasius before his death.|"['1.

When Jovian passed away, the army selected Valentinian, a sturdy, courageous man, though lacking in education, rough and fiery, yet a devout Catholic. Upon his arrival in Constantinople, he divided the empire with his brother Valens. Valentinian governed the West from Milan, as the Emperors preferred not to reside in Rome, partly due to the presence of the Senate and inconvenient old customs for a Christian ruler. Valentinian was generally fair and truthful, but could be harsh when angered, even keeping two bears for executing criminals. Valens, weaker and an Arian, banished Athanasius, but the Church of Alexandria prevailed. At this time, there was much discussion about the differences between Catholics and Arians across cities, with holy mysteries being gossiped about in public places. Pope Damasus tasked a learned deacon named Jerome to translate the Scriptures into Latin, which he did from Bethlehem to avoid the conflicts in Rome and Constantinople.|"[""1.

Maximus advanced into Italy, causing Valentinian to flee seeking aid from Theodosius. Theodosius arrived with his army, defeated Maximus, and restored Valentinian. However, Valentinian was soon murdered by a Frank chief named Arbogastes, who then set up a heathen philosopher named Eugenius as Emperor. Eugenius restored heathen practices briefly, but Theodosius marched against them. In the ensuing battle, the Christian army, led by Theodosius under the Labarum, defeated Eugenius' forces. A storm during the battle reinforced the belief that God was on their side. Eugenius was captured and put to death, and Arbogastes committed suicide. Theodosius reunited the East and West empires. He was respected but also feared for his stern nature. In a separate incident, Theodosius showed remorse and sought forgiveness after a massacre in Thessalonica.|"[""1.

Theodosius, a respected Roman Emperor, passed away in Milan at only fifty years old, leaving behind his young sons, Arcadius and Honorius. Arcadius, at eighteen, ruled the East under the guidance of Rufinus, while eleven-year-old Honorius was in Rome with Stilicho, a Vandal and trusted guardian. Trouble brewed when Rufinus plotted with the Goths, led by Alaric, to invade Greece. Stilicho, a loyal defender, defeated Alaric in battle but was later suspected by Arcadius and sent back to Italy. Alaric, seizing the opportunity, led his forces into Italy, challenging Honorius. Stilicho rallied troops, winning crucial battles against the Goths. Meanwhile, a monk named Telemachus halted gladiator fights in Rome, marking the end of such brutal spectacles.

The Romans agreed to pay a hefty ransom to Alaric, including gold, silver, silk, cloth, and pepper. Alaric spared Rome from destruction but allowed his men to plunder for six days. Despite orders not to harm churches, some damage was done. Alaric's death in the south halted the Gothic conquest. The pagans were silenced, and Rome became predominantly Christian. Alaric's brother-in-law, Ataulf, became leader of the Goths and married Theodosius' daughter. He led the Goths to Spain, establishing the Visigoths. Meanwhile, in Constantinople, St. John Chrysostom preached against vices, angering Empress Eudoxia, leading to his exile. Arcadius' son, Theodosius II, was under the care of his sister Pulcheria. In the Western Empire, Honorius ruled with the support of Teuton tribes but faced challenges due to his lack of trust and faithlessness.

Genseric, their chief, marched towards Carthage, where Boniface valiantly defended the city but was eventually forced into Hippo. St. Augustine passed away during the siege, leaving behind a legacy of faith. The Vandals, under Genseric, seized Carthage, persecuting the Catholic Church. Meanwhile, the Huns, led by Attila, terrorized the Roman Empire, demanding a hefty tribute to spare them. Attila's menacing conquests prompted a united effort by various tribes to repel him, resulting in a fierce battle at Chalons. Attila later ravaged Italy but spared Rome after a meeting with Pope Leo I.

Valentinian believed the danger had passed. However, upon Aëtius' return to Ravenna, Valentinian became envious of his accomplishments. In a fit of jealousy, Valentinian fatally wounded Aëtius. Subsequently, Valentinian offended a senator named Maximus, who sought revenge by killing Valentinian. Maximus then ascended to the throne, marrying Valentinian's widow, Eudoxia, daughter of Theodosius II of Constantinople. Eudoxia, feeling threatened by a rebel, sought assistance from Genseric, the Vandal king. Genseric, known for his ruthlessness, plundered Rome for fourteen days, taking treasures such as the golden candlestick from Jerusalem's Temple. Despite the chaos, Pope Leo bravely confronted Genseric to protect the city. Eventually, the Vandals departed, leaving Rome in disarray.

"Theodoric, a wise conqueror, settled around thirty to forty thousand families on the lands of Italy, fostering peace among his Goths. Although living in Verona, he visited Rome to maintain its buildings. The Arian king respected the Catholics and believed in fidelity to God. However, as he aged, he grew irritable and distrusting. The Romans, forgetting their past glory, displeased him. The talented Boëthius and Symmachus were imprisoned and executed by Theodoric. Boëthius penned ""The Consolations of Philosophy"" while in prison, later translated by King Alfred. The correspondence between Theodoric and other Gothic kings was conducted in Latin by Roman slaves. The able and deserving Theodoric, known as ""The Great,"" passed away, leaving behind two daughters. Subsequent Gothic kings in Northern Italy were fierce but lacked his strength and spirit. They ruled from cities like Milan, Verona, and Ravenna, with Rome under their tribute, where the Pope held significant influence. The conquerors learned civilization and Christianity from the Romans, with the clergy guiding many kings. St. Benedict, at Monte Casino, established the Benedictine rule, providing shelter in turbulent times. The Teutonic nations, settled in Roman cities, lost their vigor, leading to internal strife. Emperor Justinian and his general Belisarius reclaimed parts of the Western Empire, starting with Africa, defeating the Vandals and restoring Roman power. Justinian sent Belis"|['1.

During the summer of 536, Rome faced a dire situation. Vitiges, a brave warrior, was proclaimed king by the Goths in Rome, but the broken walls and Roman citizens' resistance led him to retreat to Ravenna. With Vitiges collecting an army, Rome faced another siege. The city suffered a terrible famine, forcing Belisarius to watch over his people day and night. Despite the hardships, Vitiges displayed great bravery outside Rome's walls. Belisarius, on the other hand, showed patience and resilience inside. The situation worsened as the siege continued, leading to the deaths of many Romans and Goths. Eventually, Belisarius pursued Vitiges to Ravenna, besieged him, made him a prisoner, and brought him to Constantinople. Italy was restored to the Empire under the governance of an officer called the Exarch.|"['1. What was the dire situation that Rome faced during the summer of 536?\nA. A devastating earthquake\nB.
