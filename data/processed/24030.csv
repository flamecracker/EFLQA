Long ago in ancient times, Æneas of Troy journeyed to Italy and wed Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus. He founded a city named Lavinium in her honor. Their son Ascanius later established the city of Alba after leaving Lavinium. For twelve generations, kings from Æneas' lineage ruled in Alba. Procas, the eleventh king, had two sons, Numitor and Amulius. Amulius, driven by greed, usurped the throne from his brother and sought to erase his line. He imprisoned Numitor's daughter, Rhea Silvia, and ordered her twin sons to be cast into the river. Miraculously, the infants survived and were nurtured by a she-wolf. Faustulus, the King's shepherd, discovered and raised the boys, Romulus and Remus, who grew up to challenge the tyrant Amulius and restore their grandfather Numitor to the throne.|"['1.

Romulus and his brother planned to leave their grandfather as king in Alba and establish a new city where they were raised by a shepherd. Many agreed to this plan, believing the new city would surpass Alba and Lavinium. But as they worked, a power struggle arose between the brothers. They sought divine guidance to determine the city's name, resulting in a dispute. Remus saw six vultures first, but Romulus saw twelve. The argument escalated to a fight, leading to Remus' death. Romulus then founded the city, named after himself, and established laws. He welcomed all to the city, increasing its strength. Romulus selected a council of a hundred men for advice. To find wives for his people, Romulus invited neighboring nations, but they refused. In response, Romulus's people abducted women during a festival, offering them marriage and respect.|"[""1.

In ancient Rome, after the Sabines captured the citadel through treachery, Romulus, the Roman king, led his men to battle against them. Despite an initial Roman retreat, Romulus rallied his troops, invoking Jupiter for help. The Romans, inspired by their king's determination, turned back and fought bravely. A Sabine leader named Curtius, boasting of victory, was nearly defeated by Romulus himself. Curtius narrowly escaped by plunging into a nearby pool, which was later named Curtius' pool. As the battle raged on, the Sabine women intervened, pleading for peace between their Roman husbands and Sabine fathers.

Long ago, after Romulus mysteriously vanished, the people of Rome needed a new king. They turned to Numa Pompilius, a righteous man from the Sabines. The Senate hesitated because they feared the Sabines' power, but eventually, they offered the throne to Numa. Seeking the gods' approval, Numa consulted an augur who prayed for signs. The gods favored Numa, and he became the second king of Rome. Numa believed in founding Rome on justice, laws, and religion. He built a temple of Janus to signify peace or war. Numa also organized the calendar into twelve lunar months, with an additional month every 24 years to align with the sun. He established priests for Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus, as well as virgins to tend to Vesta's sacred fire. Numa's laws and customs were said to be inspired by the goddess Egeria, whom he met in a nearby grove.|"[""1.

At the sight of the lone Roman champion facing three foes, the Alban host cheered, while the men of Rome feared for their champion. The Roman, unharmed, planned to defeat his enemies one by one. He pretended to flee, luring the Alban champions apart. As they pursued, he turned and swiftly defeated each. The Romans rejoiced as their champion triumphed. The Alba champion, wounded and weary, fell to the Roman's blade. The Romans honored their fallen with burials. Horatius, the Roman champion, returned to the city with the spoils of his victory. At the gate, he encountered his sister, mourning her betrothed, an Alba champion. Enraged by her mourning, Horatius slew her. The people, torn between his service and his crime, brought him to trial. The law demanded two judges, who found him guilty. As he faced punishment, Horatius appealed to the people, seeking their judgment.|['1.

Long ago, during a time of great turmoil, a young man from Rome faced a grave accusation. His father, in tears, pleaded with the people not to condemn his son, who had shown immense courage in battle. The citizens, moved by his plea and the valiant deeds of the youth, decided to let him go free. However, as a formality, the father was asked to make a trespass offering for his son. The father completed the required rituals and set up a beam where his son had fought bravely. Meanwhile, the men of Alba, feeling betrayed by the actions of three soldiers, planned to wage war against Rome. Mettus, a leader from Alba, sought to stir up conflict with the help of neighboring nations.

The King of Rome, after a great victory over the army of Alba, addressed both armies in a solemn assembly. He praised the Romans for their valor and warned them of the treachery of their former allies. The King revealed that Mettus, the leader of Alba, had betrayed them, causing the war and breaking the peace treaty. Mettus was then seized by the Roman captains and punished for his deceit. The King declared his intention to make the people of Alba citizens of Rome, unifying the two cities into one commonwealth. The men of Alba were divided in their reactions, but none dared to speak out. Eventually, the people of Alba were taken to Rome, while their city was destroyed.

When Alba was destroyed, Rome flourished. The citizens doubled in number, the Coelian hill was added, and a palace was built for the King. The Senate expanded, a temple named Hostilia was erected, and ten squadrons of horsemen were chosen from Alba. A shower of stones on Mount Alba caused a festival in Rome. King Tullus fell ill, turning to superstition. His improper sacrifices led to his demise. Demaratus of Corinth had a son, Lucumo, who married Tanaquil. They moved to Rome, where an eagle's augury foretold Lucumo's rise. Known as Tarquinius, he befriended King Ancus, who appointed him guardian to his sons. Ancus died, and Tarquinius urged immediate kingship. The sons were sent hunting, paving the way for Tarquinius to address the people, seeking the throne.|"['1.

King Tarquin persuaded the people to choose him as their ruler. He pleased them by waging war with the Latins, capturing a city, and building the great circus for entertainment. The Sabines attacked while he was building a stone wall around the city, leading to a fierce battle. Seeking to strengthen his army, he planned to increase the number of horsemen. The soothsayer Attus Navius opposed this, claiming divine intervention was needed. To test him, the King asked Attus to cut a whetstone with a razor, which he miraculously did. A statue was erected in his honor. The soothsayers gained great respect, influencing all decisions. King Tarquin added more horsemen but kept the original companies. He won battles against the Sabines and Latins, expanding Rome's territory. Additionally, a woman offered him prophecies in twelve books, burning some when he refused to buy, leading to a mystical purchase that guided Rome in times of need.|"['1.

In ancient times, a remarkable event occurred in the King's palace. A young slave named Servius Tullius was the center of this marvel. One night, as he slept, flames appeared above his head. When the King and Queen were summoned to witness this unusual sight, some servants tried to douse the fire, but Queen Tanaquil intervened. She insisted that the child be left untouched. Upon waking, the flames vanished. Queen Tanaquil foresaw a bright future for the boy and urged the King to treat him with kindness. As Servius grew, he displayed qualities befitting royalty. Eventually, the King chose him as a suitor for his daughter. Despite rumors about Servius' lineage, his noble character and actions spoke volumes.

After this event, the Queen addressed the anxious crowd from an upper chamber overlooking New Street. She assured them that the King, though initially stunned, was recovering well from the attack. She urged the people to have hope and courage, explaining that the wound was not severe. The Queen instructed the crowd to obey Servius, who would temporarily oversee the King's duties until his return. Servius, wearing the royal robe, then emerged to administer justice in the King's absence. Unbeknownst to the public, the Queen eventually announced the King's passing, and Servius was proclaimed King. He strategically solidified his position by marrying his daughters to the sons of King Tarquin. Despite efforts to maintain peace, future challenges from within the kingdom were foretold.

In ancient Rome, a prophecy foretold that the nation offering a great heifer in sacrifice to Diana would rule. A Sabine farmer had such a heifer, and the priest of Diana instructed him to purify himself in the Tiber before the sacrifice. The heifer was offered, pleasing King Servius and the people. Meanwhile, King Tarquin's sons had different personalities; Lucius was haughty, and Aruns was gentle. Lucius married Tullia, Aruns' fierce wife, after they conspired to get rid of their spouses. Tullia, driven by ambition, goaded Lucius to seize the throne. Lucius won the favor of nobles and incited a rebellion against King Tarquin, claiming the throne.

In ancient Rome, during the reign of King Tarquin, a brave young man named Lucius Junius, also known as Brutus, devised a plan to free the people from the oppressive rule of the King. When the King's sons sought the oracle's guidance on future kingship, Brutus cleverly interpreted the oracle's message and took a significant oath to avenge a grievous wrong done to Lucretia. He rallied the people against the King's tyranny, leading to the banishment of King Tarquin and his family. Brutus, along with Collatinus, was appointed consul, but Collatinus, being of Tarquin lineage, was also urged to leave Rome to safeguard the newfound liberty. The people, led by Brutus, passed a law banishing all of the Tarquin family from Rome forever, ensuring the end of kingship in the city.|"[""1.

The King's return by force was expected, but as he delayed, liberty was nearly lost due to treachery. Young nobles who enjoyed luxury with the King's son felt oppressed by their newfound equal rights. Ambassadors from King Tarquin sought to retrieve his goods, secretly plotting his return. The Senate debated returning the goods, fearing war if they did or aiding his return if they did not. The ambassadors, pretending to focus on the goods, conspired with the nobles.

After a fierce battle between the Romans and the Etrurians, no clear victor emerged. The men of Veii fled, but the men of Tarquinii gained ground until a sudden panic struck the Etrurian army, causing them to retreat. Legend has it that a voice from hero Horatius' grave proclaimed the Romans as victors, as one more Etrurian had fallen in battle. The next day, the Etrurians were nowhere to be found, and Consul Valerius led a triumphant return to Rome, honoring fallen hero Brutus. King Tarquin sought refuge with Lars Porsenna of Clusium, urging him to restore their Tuscan dignity and prevent the trend of exiling kings. Persuaded, Porsenna amassed an army to march on Rome, causing great fear among its citizens. The city prepared for siege, with Horatius Cocles bravely defending a crucial bridge against the enemy, ensuring Rome's safety.|"['1.

The brave act of Caius Mucius, later known as Scævola, saved Rome from the siege of King Porsenna. Determined to show his loyalty to Rome, Mucius attempted to assassinate the King but mistakenly killed a scribe instead. Captured and brought before the King, Mucius boldly declared his intentions and proved his resolve by thrusting his hand into a fire without flinching. Impressed by Mucius's courage, King Porsenna spared his life and learned of the three hundred Romans sworn to assassinate him. Fearing further attacks, the King offered peace to Rome, including conditions that were mostly rejected by the Romans.

About fifty years after the kings were driven out of Rome, there was great unrest due to debt issues. Creditors were harsh, imprisoning debtors who couldn't pay, treating them like slaves. The people feared being imprisoned too. The rich refused to help, so the people left Rome, camping at the Sacred Hill. The nobles feared for Rome's future and sent Menenius Agrippa to talk to the people. He told a parable about the body's unity, convincing them to reconcile. They agreed to have tribunes to protect their rights. Later, a famine struck, and some nobles, like Marcius Coriolanus, were against the people's officers. Marcius even suggested using the famine against them.|"['1.

When Coriolanus, once set against his own land, changed his mind, women wailed while he led his troops away. Kæso Fabius, a valiant man of Rome, urged for fair land division among the people. The nobles rejected his counsel, deeming his wisdom folly. Displeased, Kæso sought to serve Rome beyond its borders. The Fabii volunteered to combat Veii, a nearby foe, to maintain peace. The family, three hundred strong, marched out, cheered by citizens. They prayed for divine guidance on their mission to establish a fort near the Cremera River.|"['1.

The Fabii were a powerful Roman house that often clashed with the men of Veii, a wealthy city in Etruria. The Fabii grew overconfident due to their repeated victories and began to make careless decisions. One day, while chasing cattle, they fell into an enemy ambush set by the men of Veii. The Fabii fought bravely but were outnumbered and surrounded. In a desperate attempt to survive, they retreated to a nearby hill but were eventually overwhelmed. The entire Fabii clan was wiped out except for a young boy who was not present at the battle. This boy later grew up and established a new generation of Fabii who served Rome in times of need.

In the enemy's camp, there was a lot of loot found. The Dictator decided to give it all to his own soldiers. He told the Consul's army that they would not get any share as they were almost captured by the enemy. Minucius was told to be a lieutenant until he learned to act like a consul. Meanwhile, in Rome, the Senate met and ordered Cincinnatus to enter the city in a triumph. His soldiers followed him, and the captured enemy generals were led in front. The city celebrated with banquets. Volscius, who falsely accused Kæso, was exiled for perjury. Cincinnatus resigned after ensuring justice.

Once, a centurion named Lucius Virginius, known for his integrity and respect, had a daughter named Virginia. She was engaged to Icilius, a former tribune. Appius Claudius, a powerful figure, falsely claimed Virginia as a slave. When Claudius tried to seize her in the marketplace on her way to school, chaos ensued. The citizens, recognizing Virginia's innocence, gathered around. Claudius, unable to take her by force, resorted to legal means. He summoned Virginia before Appius for judgment. Claudius fabricated a story, but Virginia's supporters demanded a fair trial in her father's presence. Appius, biased and unjust, ruled in favor of Claudius, causing unrest.

So much time was saved when the friends of the maiden decided that the son of Numitorius and the brother of Icilius, both young and active men, should quickly go to the camp and bring Virginius back. They rode swiftly and informed the father of the situation. Meanwhile, Appius, pretending to wait for other matters on the judgment-seat, sent a message to keep Virginius in custody. Despite this, Virginius had already left for the city. Upon his arrival at dawn, he dressed humbly and begged for help while carrying his daughter, also in simple attire. Icilius and the women with them wept, moving onlookers. Appius ignored their pleas and quickly issued a harsh verdict without allowing Virginius to speak. The people were frightened when Appius accused them of sedition and ordered the removal of the crowd.

Virginius reached the camp at Mount Vecilius, rousing the soldiers even more than the city. He explained he killed his daughter to spare her from slavery and shame, hoping to avenge her with his comrades. Other city messengers convinced the soldiers that the Ten's power was broken, and Appius had fled. The soldiers armed themselves and marched to Rome, camping on the Aventine. The Ten refused to resign until they finished drafting laws, but the army and citizens moved to the Sacred Hill. The Ten finally relented, fearing the people's wrath. Appius and Oppius were imprisoned, with Appius taking his life. Claudius, who claimed Virginia as a slave, was banished. With justice served, peace returned.

In the next year, war erupted with the Volscians, leading to the capture of Anxur, a prominent city. The victorious soldiers received spoils and were promised pay from the public treasury. Subsequently, a decision was made to declare war on Veii, prompting the recruitment of a large army. Most soldiers volunteered willingly for this cause. Veii, besieged by the Romans, faced internal turmoil as its people appointed a king, causing unrest among the Etrurians. The Etrurians condemned the king's actions, which disrupted their religious festivals, leading to a decree withholding aid from Veii.

Many years into the siege of Veii, a Roman became intrigued by a prophecy chanted by a soothsayer. Curious, he sought the soothsayer's counsel regarding a marvel he had encountered. Without arms, they conversed privately before the Roman, a strong young man, carried the Etrurian to the Roman camp. The soothsayer was presented to the general and then to the Senate. The soothsayer explained that draining the water from the lake of Alba would lead to Veii's downfall. To confirm this, messengers were dispatched to Delphi, returning with a prophecy endorsing the soothsayer's advice. The Senate honored the soothsayer, seeking his guidance on neglected rites. With a new Dictator, Furius Camillus, Rome prepared to capture Veii, reinforced by allies. Camillus vowed to celebrate the Great Games upon victory and to rebuild the temple of Mother Matuta. The Roman army advanced towards Veii, fortifying their position and driving a mine to breach the citadel.|"['1.

The Dictator, after securing victory and preparing to capture the wealthy city of Veii, faced a dilemma. He feared his soldiers might be angered if he seemed stingy with the spoils or that the Senate might criticize him for being too generous. So, he asked the Senate what to do. A debate ensued, and it was decided that those who wanted a share should go to the Dictator. A vast crowd gathered at the camp, and after sacrifices, the soldiers were armed. The Dictator prayed to Apollo and Queen Juno, vowing a tenth of the spoils to Apollo. The soldiers attacked Veii from all sides, catching the inhabitants off guard. Eventually, the city fell, and the spoils were beyond expectation. The Dictator prayed for the State's well-being, stumbled, and this was seen as an ominous sign. The city was plundered, and the next day the Dictator sold the free inhabitants at auction. The spoils were taken to Rome, including Juno's statue, with reverence and awe. Juno's statue was said to have nodded and spoken, agreeing to go to Rome. The statue was carried to Rome and placed in a temple on Mount Aventine.|"[""1.

Upon hearing the news in Rome, there was immense joy. Despite doubts due to prophecies and the city's strength, the victory over Veii was celebrated. Temples overflowed with women offering gratitude to the gods. A four-day thanksgiving was decreed by the Senate, a first in history. Camillus, hailed as a hero, was greeted by all ranks upon his return. However, some criticized his grand entrance, likening it to a god. He then built temples and resigned as Dictator. The people were required to pay a tenth of the spoils to Apollo, causing unrest. Plans to send a colony to the Volscians were met with resistance. The people preferred Veii's fertile lands and grandeur, proposing a division of the State. Camillus opposed, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling the vow.

The Senate was delighted by the generosity of the women, who were then granted the privilege of using covered chariots for public worship and games. However, the tribunes remained critical of Camillus, blaming him for the loss of spoils from Veii. The following year, war broke out with the men of Falerii, who initially stayed within their walls but later engaged the Romans in battle. Camillus, leading the Roman forces, outmaneuvered the enemy and forced them to flee back to their city with heavy casualties. The town was besieged, and the situation seemed prolonged until Camillus' virtue and luck turned the tide. Meanwhile, a teacher from Falerii tried to betray his city by bringing the children of its leaders to Camillus, who, in Roman fashion, rejected the treacherous gift and sent the teacher back scourged. The people of Falerii, impressed by Camillus' integrity, sought peace with Rome, which was granted upon payment of taxes. Additionally, Roman messengers, carrying a golden bowl as an offering to the gods, were captured by pirates but were eventually rescued and safely returned to Rome.|"['1.

"In the fourth year after these events, a man named Marcus Cædicius, a commoner, informed the authorities that he had heard a voice louder than a human voice in the new street above the temple of Vesta, saying, ""The Gauls are coming."" This warning was disregarded because the man was not considered important, and the Gauls were a distant and little-known nation. The people of Rome not only ignored the warnings of the gods but also alienated themselves by banishing Camillus from the city. Camillus, facing trial for the spoil of Veii and mourning the loss of his almost grown son, was abandoned by the people. He went into exile after his tribe members offered to pay his fine but could not secure his acquittal. Ambassadors from Clusium sought help from Rome against the Gauls, who had crossed the Alps and were causing unrest in Etruria. The Gauls demanded land from Clusium, threatening war if their demands were not met.

Great anger arose on both sides, leading to preparations for battle. The ambassadors, defying the rules of nations, joined the fight, causing a Gaul chieftain to fall by Roman hands. The Gauls, recognizing the ambassadors, sought vengeance on Rome. Ambassadors were sent to demand the punishment of the Fabii, but the Senate favored them due to their status. The Gauls, outraged by Rome's decision, declared war. Rome, blind to the impending danger, neglected to take proper precautions. The Gauls, enraged by the promotion of those who disregarded laws, swiftly marched towards Rome. The Romans hastily assembled an army and met the Gauls at the river Allia, where a fierce battle ensued, resulting in a Roman defeat. The Romans fled in terror, leaving the reserves to fend off the Gauls briefly. Many Romans perished in the chaos, with some drowned in the Tiber.

The Gauls were amazed by their easy victory and quick arrival at Rome. At first, they feared a trick, but after burying the dead and piling the arms, they cautiously moved towards the city. Upon finding the gates open and no defenses, they hesitated, fearing a trap in the dark. Meanwhile, Rome was in despair, believing all lost in battle. The Gauls, seen moving near the walls, caused panic. The citizens prepared to defend the Capitol, saving what they could of their gods. The priests and virgins of Vesta carried sacred items away, while the people scattered, some fleeing the city. A man, Albinius, helped transport the sacred items to safety. The Gauls entered Rome peacefully, but upon encountering the nobles in their grand attire, a clash ensued, leading to the massacre of the nobility and the city's plunder and destruction.|"['1.

During a siege in Rome, the Gauls aimed to conquer the Citadel where a small group of Romans held out. The Romans, despite being surrounded by destruction and enemies, refused to surrender. The Gauls, after failing to take the Citadel by assault, resorted to a blockade. Meanwhile, Camillus, a Roman leader residing in Ardea, rallied the people to defend their city. He convinced the Ardeans that the Gauls, though intimidating, were vulnerable due to their carelessness. Camillus led a successful surprise attack on the Gauls' unguarded camp, saving his people from imminent danger.

At Veii, Romans and Latium volunteers gathered strength to fight the Gauls. They needed Camillus as their leader, but he was in exile. A messenger was sent through enemy lines to bring him back. Meanwhile, the Gauls tried to sneak into Rome through a secret path. They climbed silently, but geese alerted the Romans. Manlius, a Roman, fought bravely and saved the city. The Romans rewarded him and punished the guard who failed. Both armies suffered from famine and disease. The Gauls wanted to surrender due to hunger, but the Romans showed they had food to spare.

Both gods and men rejected the idea of Rome being redeemed through gold. The Dictator intervened before the payment was completed and ordered the Gauls to leave, despite their protests about the agreement. Camillus, as Dictator, refused to honor the pact made without his consent and urged his men to prepare for battle. He encouraged them to defend their homeland with weapons, not wealth, reminding them of their loved ones and sacred places. Camillus led his troops in battle against the Gauls, who, caught off guard, were easily defeated.

In ancient Rome, during a great war with the Latins, Consul Decius received honors for his bravery. He was given a golden crown, a hundred oxen, and the legion crowned him with grass for deliverance from siege. Decius then sacrificed a white ox to Mars and gave the other oxen to his soldiers. Before a crucial battle against the Latins near Mount Vesuvius, both Consuls had prophetic dreams. They were told that victory would go to the side that devotes a general and an army to the gods below. Decius, seeing an unfavorable sign, devoted himself to the gods for Rome's victory. His sacrifice inspired the Roman troops, who fought courageously and defeated the Latins, securing victory for Rome. Decius' sacrifice was remembered with great honor, and his son later became Consul, continuing the family's legacy of service to Rome.|"['1.

In the ancient battle, the Romans faced the Gauls and Samnites. Quintus Fabius and Decius Mus led the charge. Fabius defended, waiting for the enemies to tire, while Decius attacked boldly. Decius, seeing the foot soldiers falter, brought in horsemen. Despite initial success, a new tactic with chariots caused panic. Decius tried to rally his troops but, seeing no hope, invoked a ritual of self-sacrifice. After Decius' sacrifice, the Romans fought fiercely. The Gauls, disoriented, lost their advantage.

Some debated their fate, questioning how to escape the mountains' shadow. Feeling trapped by enemies, sleep and food were forgotten. The Samnites, too, pondered their victory's aftermath.

Rejecting dishonor, he warned of Rome's vengeance. When peace terms were offered, despair gripped the Romans.

After the Consuls met with Pontius, they didn't make a treaty due to the need for people's consent and heralds, but a covenant. The Consuls, lieutenants, quaestors, and tribunes became sureties. Peace wasn't immediate, so they agreed to give 600 horsemen as hostages. If the covenant failed, the hostages would die. Back at the camp, soldiers were angry, blaming the Consuls for the disgrace. They were humiliated, sent without weapons and with one garment each. Later, hostages were taken away, the Consuls were stripped of their cloaks, and soldiers were humiliated. The Romans, overwhelmed with shame, were helped by Capua. The Romans were silent and ashamed, losing not just arms but courage. The Romans' despair and silence worried the Senate in Rome. The Consuls of the next year discussed the peace of Caudium. Postumius suggested delivering themselves to the Samnites to free the Roman people from the unauthorized peace. He advised raising an army and waiting at the enemy's border. He hoped the Gods would aid Rome as before.|"[""1.
