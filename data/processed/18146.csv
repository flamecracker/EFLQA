In the kingdom, three young Princes, Yestergold, Goldmorrow, and Goldenday, held differing views on the present Age.

The King sought advice from a wise Councillor who proposed a journey to find the Age of Gold. Each Prince was to choose companions for the quest. Yestergold selected a painter and a poet, Goldmorrow chose two sky watchers, and Goldenday asked his sister Faith to join him.

As the dust settled from the horses' hoofs, Goldenday and his sister arrived at the scene where villagers were struck by a deadly pestilence.

We reached Bethany on the day Lazarus was raised. I stood among the crowd at the grave, witnessing the sisters' grief. To my surprise, nothing appeared as I had imagined. Even the Lord didn't seem like someone who could perform such miracles. When Lazarus emerged from the grave, some mocked the Lord despite witnessing the incredible event. Later, I saw the Lord being led to Calvary by scoffers, bearing the weight of the Cross. The streets were bustling with activity, indifferent to His suffering. Overwhelmed with sorrow, I left the heartless crowd and turned towards home, thankful to live in a time where we see the Lord's glory in the Gospels.

Our greatest trial was approaching. The Lord had returned to earth, living among the people of that Age. As we arrived at His palace, it was unlike any we had seen, resembling clouds atop hills. Witnessing His emergence, the brilliance overwhelmed us, making it impossible to look directly at Him. Feeling unworthy, we fell to the ground, crying for mercy. Reflecting on a missed opportunity to aid plague-stricken peasants, I realized my sin. Goldmorrow's tale ended with heavenly music drawing near. A procession entered, led by white-robed children, followed by a coffin adorned with flowers. Princess Faith, accompanied by her attendants and bare-headed peasants, followed, honoring Prince Goldenday, who sacrificed his life to help the villagers.|"[""1.

In a faraway kingdom, a dear Prince sacrificed his life to bring about a better era, just like Christ did for all. The people mourned his loss but understood that his sacrifice was necessary for a Golden Age to emerge. As time passed, the wise Pakronus passed away, and Yestergold ascended the throne, with his brother as Prime Minister. Together, they led the kingdom into a Golden Age, battling against sin and misery. Their sister, Faith, dedicated herself to education and healthcare. Their reign was described as a time of great prosperity and progress.

Bassanio stepped in, saying Antonio should not sign such a bond for his sake. Despite this, the young merchant was confident his ships would return before the payment day. Shylock, pretending surprise, criticized Christians for their distrust. He offered friendship, not desiring the pound of flesh penalty. Portia, the lady Bassanio loved, declared her devotion to him and presented him with a ring. Gratiano, Bassanio's companion, revealed his debt but sought to marry Nerissa, Portia's maid.

Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a young prince named Bladud. He was the cherished child of King Lud Hurdebras and Queen of the realm. Unfortunately, Prince Bladud fell ill with a terrible disease known as leprosy. In those ancient times, leprosy was a dreaded affliction, and those who suffered from it were cast out from society to fend for themselves in the wilderness. Despite his royal status, the young prince was not spared from this fate. The council of elders, fearing the spread of the disease, demanded that the king banish his own son.

The caring mother of Bladud, who was in a difficult situation, tried hard to persuade her royal husband to oppose this cruel command. She used all the love and tenderness a mother could muster to defend her only child, who was suffering greatly and was even dearer to her heart. Despite feeling the queen's emotional plea deeply, the distressed father could not go against the wishes of his people. He had to suppress any feelings of compassion for his innocent son and sentence him to exile. Bladud, waiting for his father's decision, cried silently, not wanting to add to his parents' pain. When the harsh exile verdict was confirmed by his once loving father, he cried out in sorrow, covered his disfigured face, and left his childhood home forever, wondering who would show him compassion now that he was abandoned by his parents.|"[""1.

Bladud felt embarrassed. He was used to playing games with the sons of the leaders and had no practical skills for his current situation. He could only sharpen arrows, string bows, and shoot at targets. Math, a shepherd-boy, warned Bladud not to reveal these skills to the peaceful herdsmen of Caynsham, as it might create a negative impression. Math advised Bladud against seeking service dressed as he was, in a royal attire. Instead, Math swapped clothes with Bladud, giving him a shepherd's suit. Bladud, though ignorant of shepherding, was offered a job by an aged swineherd. Despite the hardships and separation from his previous life, Bladud accepted the new role with patience and diligence, even though he was suffering from a painful disease. He worked hard, tending to the swine, and concealed the fact that some pigs were infected like him. Despite his unhappiness, Bladud continued his duties faithfully, trying to avoid drawing attention to his affliction.|"['1.

The old herdsman was pleased with Bladud's care of the swine, leading them to new areas for fresh food. Bladud decided to cross the river Avon, hoping for better grazing on the other side. He returned to seek permission from his master and was granted it. As they crossed, the pigs suddenly ran off into a swamp, rolling and playing joyfully. Bladud, puzzled, watched them wallow until hunger drove them to the woods for acorns. They returned to the swamp, much to his surprise. Bladud, observing their behavior, realized they found relief in the warm salt springs there. He followed suit, bathing in the springs and finding a cure for his leprosy. Overjoyed at his healing, he looked forward to reuniting with his family.|['1.

The elderly man, worried about Bladud's long absence, was about to search for him when he heard the swine approaching and saw Bladud coming back. Bladud knelt before his master, sharing that he had been cured of leprosy. Initially a prince, he had become a servant due to his affliction. Bladud believed it was a test from a higher power. He suggested visiting his father's court. The herdsman, skeptical, agreed, and they journeyed to the royal city. The city was celebrating a festival, and Bladud stood out in humble attire. The herdsman, embarrassed by the attention, blamed Bladud for the situation, especially when a pig followed them, causing chaos. Bladud defended the pig from cruel treatment by a group of boys until a shepherd-lad and his dog intervened, revealing the lad to be an old friend, Math of the Downs.|"['1.

Long ago, in Italy, a noble young duke ruled over his land. His people adored him, but worried as he refused to marry. Each morning, his advisors pressed him about marriage, urging him to secure an heir for his dukedom. One day, the duke agreed to marry, but on one condition – that his people accept his choice, whether duchess or beggar. The court rejoiced, and the duke set off on a hunt. Along the way, they passed Janiculo's hut, where Griselda, a kind and lovely girl, lived with her father. Rumors spread that the duke sought the hand of the neighboring duke's daughter. Excitement grew as people anticipated the duke's return with his bride on a milk-white palfrey.|"[""1.

As the sun began to set, Griselda heard the approaching hunting party. Curious about the young bride in their midst, she peered out from her humble home. The duke, leading a white horse, rode past, but the bride was missing. To her surprise, the duke requested her father's presence. Trembling with fear, Janiculo was stunned when the duke asked for Griselda's hand in marriage. Overwhelmed, Janiculo struggled to respond, stating that everything in the kingdom belonged to the duke, including his daughter. Griselda was then brought out and informed she would be the duke's bride. Tearful and astonished, she was led to the palace on the white horse.

The decision he made was harsh, making it hard to believe he truly cared for Griselda. He involved only his old servant, Furio, in his plan. One day, Griselda was with her children, lovingly caring for them as she always did. The duke, feeling the need to separate her from the children due to her humble background, sent Furio to take them away. Griselda, upon hearing this, was devastated. She pleaded and wept as Furio took the children. The duke, though unmoved by her sorrow, secretly felt remorse.

Month after month and year after year passed by, and repeatedly the duke's suspicion prompted him to test his wife's obedience and patience. He expelled Janiculo, Griselda's father, from the palace, despite Griselda's silent suffering. After twelve years of marriage, Griselda had won the people's hearts with her kind demeanor and patient ways. Yet, the duke, unsatisfied, devised one final trial. On their wedding anniversary, he announced his intention to marry another, more suitable bride. Griselda, with unwavering grace, accepted his decision, only requesting that the new bride not endure the same hardships she had faced. Griselda, without complaint, prepared to leave the palace, but the duke revealed a surprising truth - the noble youth and maiden beside him were their children, hidden from Griselda all these years.

Three years later, Durer started working as the Emperor's secretary. Eventually, he became a private secretary himself. Later on, he was granted a barony and a beautiful estate. The Counsellor Werter, who had once made prophecies about Durer, spoke scornfully about his success. Durer, now a Baron, glared back at him with deep-seated hatred. The Emperor, influenced by the Counsellor, began to coldly treat Werter, eventually leading to his disgrace. Meanwhile, Durer continued to rise in status, becoming a minister and marrying a wealthy woman.
