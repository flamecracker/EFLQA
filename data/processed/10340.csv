Mrs. Foster wanted to thank Dabney for helping Ford, but Dabney was too busy decorating Miranda's parlors for the guests arriving early. Jenny Walters, usually sharp, was kind that evening and made friends with Annie. Dick Lee, dressed in his best, was relieved to be near the cool waves. Dabney was tired after hosting the party and dreaming of driving runaway teams. The Fosters decided to stay longer in the country. Dabney and his friends got seats together on the train.

Joe and Fuz appeared ashamed, while Dick sat up straight after a glance from Dab Kinzer. Frank Harley, who respected all, got information and spoke to the head waiter, Ford Foster, who was white. The boys had a good dinner picked by Ford. Dick felt his first social victory. They marched to the Grand Central Railroad Depot. Ford was the only one who had seen it, and it was large. They secured seats in the sleeping-car for their trip to Grantley. They spent the day looking out of the windows, while Joe and Fuz shared stories about Grantley and its academy. They felt fresh the next morning for their ride on the railway, passing through new scenery.

"Almira grinned, resembling her mother too much. Dabney couldn't see any resemblance to Annie Foster or his sisters, Samantha, Keziah, or Pamela. He believed any of them could outdo Almira in smiling. Almira's mother reminded her not to address the new boarders as ""mister"" and quickly showed them their rooms. The house had a small dining and sitting room on the first floor and two bedrooms on the second floor. Dab and Ford got the larger room, while Frank had the inner one. The main building had a hall, a parlor, a bedroom, and two rooms upstairs. The kitchen and milk-room were added later, with a small garret room.

The name printed under the engraving was barely noticed by Dick before the Principal of Grantley Academy entered. Dr. Brandegee's warm welcome put the boys at ease. Each student felt a desire to share their knowledge. The doctor's familiarity with the boys surprised them, making them eager to talk about their studies. Dr. Brandegee's French questioning revealed the extent of their learning. Dabney felt overwhelmed by the doctor's inquiries but managed to answer them. The doctor's questions spanned various subjects, including geography, history, and arithmetic. The boys were informed about their parents' letters and the importance of punctuality. After a brief examination, they were dismissed until the start of school. The boys returned to their boarding house, contemplating the upcoming challenges.

The first day at school was peaceful, with no major conflicts. The new students were not very popular yet. Dick was busy with chores and getting instructions from Mrs. Myers and Almira. He managed to polish his shoes and fix his red necktie. The topic of going to church came up at breakfast, and Mrs. Myers and Almira approved of the students' comments. Dick and his friends hurried to church, where they had a pew to themselves and sang together. Dick looked sharp and thought of his mother, wishing she could see him.

"Mrs. Myers was pleased with her boarders' good behavior during the service and sermon, but she knew she had a duty to fulfill. As the boarders tried to slip away, Mrs. Myers and Almira awaited them, making escape impossible. Mrs. Myers proudly introduced the boys to the deacon, showcasing their diverse backgrounds. The deacon warmly greeted each boy. Mrs. Myers continued her introductions, including a social magnate who showed interest in Frank's missionary parents. Dick's introduction caught the attention of a member promoting emigration to Liberia. The boys unwittingly shattered Almira's hopes of social advancement with a colored servant. As the boys walked home, they couldn't help but compare their present company to others. At Grantley Academy, a large number of new scholars gathered, making up nearly two hundred students. The young ladies' department had about a hundred students, each with their own unique qualities. The class-rooms for the lady teachers were separate from the boys', only meeting during morning exercises.

Ford and Frank had experience in writing letters, but Dab was new to it, and Dick refused help. He was particular about pronunciation. Old Bill Lee relied on his wife's knowledge and was proud of his letter. Glorianna praised Dick and Dab as exceptional students. Glorianna visited the Morris mansion, and Mrs. Kinzer welcomed her. The group discussed their journey to Grantley and settling in. They decided to go fishing on Saturday instead of playing ball. Mrs. Myers insisted Richard work instead.

Conversation was quiet during Friday evening's supper at Mrs. Myers' home. Mrs. Myers, her daughter, and the three boarders tried to outdo each other in politeness. Meanwhile, poor Dick Lee in the kitchen only managed a muffled groan, planning to get up early to find the best worms in the garden. Upstairs, the closed door hid lively discussions. Ford Foster explained that he didn't expect much since his father only paid for board. The boys later hitched a ride with a farmer and reached Green Pond sooner than expected. The farmer mentioned that fish were scarce but shared a tip about fishing for seedling fish. The boys headed to the water, armed with minnow-poles and high hopes for a successful fishing trip.|"['1.

Dabney and his friends were keen on catching minnows, experimenting with different bait, and wishing for a boat to venture into deeper waters. While exploring the shoreline, Dabney stumbled upon a makeshift boat behind a fallen tree. They got it afloat and had a blast catching pickerel, bass, and perch. The cooking of the fish by the lake was just as enjoyable as catching them. Dabney proposed fixing up the boat for future trips. Later, Dick Lee, a new boy at the academy, got caught up watching a baseball game and ended up in a scuffle defending his basket. Ford and Frank intervened, and the situation calmed down. As they headed back, they drew attention with their impressive string of fish, sparking curiosity among the other boys.|['1.

One of my father's Hindu converts, a juggler, taught me some sleight-of-hand tricks, which are the best in the world. Although my father doesn't approve of it much, we can still have some fun with it. The idea struck me when I saw those items on the ground. Dick Lee and the others were relieved to escape the crowd, especially when Dr. Brandegee, a former athlete, showed interest in the game. The boys quickly resolved a situation involving a colored boy, earning respect from their peers. Despite the admiration for their fishing skills, they managed to reach Dr. Brandegee's place efficiently. Mrs. Myers and Miss Almira were surprised by the boys' independence and determination. The boys, content with their day, discussed their successful fishing trip and the resolution with the Hart boys.|"[""1.
