"I admit I had doubts about the story, but to hide my feelings, I bent down and petted the dog while the man talked. The dog seemed to enjoy the attention. Suddenly, I had a realization. The man seemed briefly puzzled, but then he smiled and said, ""I have to part with him, not sell him. If I part with him, my friend keeps him, and we may meet again, but if I sell him, he's gone forever."" The man offered to part with the dog under one condition. I declined, saying I don't name dogs as it's like treating them as Christians, which they can't be. Little did I know the bond that would form between Dumps and me. When we got home, Dumps showed good manners by wiping his feet and waiting for me to enter first. Dumps showed trust by sitting and looking up at me. I was moved by his confidence. I made it clear to Dumps that we would be good friends, setting two rules for him. Dumps seemed to understand, wagging his tail slightly."|"[""1.

"Refer to its rear tuft advisedly, because, at a short distance, my dog, when at rest, looked like a long, shapeless mass. But when called, three tufts of hair sprang up, indicating his ears and tail. ""I never feel quite at ease,"" Mrs. Miff said, always alert. ""You never know when these creatures will attack."" She backed out of the room cautiously, and the dog remained motionless. After Mrs. Miff left, the dog came to me for a chat until she returned with food.

The warm day turned cloudy and humid as I set out to see my patients. Dark storm clouds loomed, hinting at rain. I hurried back for an umbrella. When I let my dog, Dumps, out, he joyfully danced around me. Mrs. Miff, in contrast, hurried to her room and locked herself in. Despite Dumps' initial restlessness, he behaved well on our walk. We sought shelter from a sudden downpour in an alley. The rain passed quickly, leaving Dumps looking bedraggled. As we neared a grimy area, Dumps' demeanor shifted, showing caution. A street boy ran into me, demanding payment for the collision. Despite his audacity, I found his boldness amusing. He asked for change at a nearby pub, but I declined and continued on my way.|"['1.

I was interrupted by a small dog that joyfully danced around a boy, wagging its tail vigorously. The dog's exuberance was evident as it wriggled its body with delight, a common behavior when dogs reunite with old friends unexpectedly. The boy explained how he sold the pup for a mere five bob to a pleasant but poor young lady who desperately wanted the dog. The conversation then shifted to the dog's mysterious history, with the boy expressing disdain for the low fellow who had taken Punch from the young lady. The boy shared his experiences of sleeping in unusual places, like water-butts, and his nomadic lifestyle without a permanent home. His colorful anecdotes painted a vivid picture of his unconventional yet resilient existence.|"['1.

"They tease me with funny names, like Monkey-face, Screwnose, Cheeks, Squeaker, Roundeyes, and Slidder. I kind of like Slidder the best and usually answer to it. But, as I was saying, I had been away for a week, and when I came home—""It's not about me, it's Punch's story,"" interrupted the waif, petting the dog. ""Well, when I got home late and tired, I went to my water-butt. As soon as I put my head in, I heard a growl. A fierce terrier leaped out! I gave it a kick, and it ran off.

"It was heartwarming yet sorrowful to see the smile on old Mrs. Willis' face when she greeted me. She seemed happy to see me, but the smile didn't quite match the tired look on her face.

"""Die!"" Mrs. Willis exclaimed with surprising energy. ""She did not die! My Edie left me months ago, seeming like years now. She went for a walk one afternoon, a beautiful sunbeam, and never returned. I couldn't walk then, or I would have searched all of London for her. A missionary tried to find her, but in vain. Once a body was found, but it wasn't her. I waited, hoping she'd return. Now, I have no hope. She must have met with an accident.

"I firmly stated that doing something _wrong_ could never be justified as _right_, and beginning a path of genuine kindness based on such principles would likely end poorly. ""That's correct.

"As the young girl rang the doorbell of a nearby house, Dumps, the dog, suddenly halted and began to bark, whine, and yelp in excitement. He dashed up the stairs, circling the lady with joy.

I was deeply attached to my dog, despite being surprised by the strength of our bond. Parting with him for the young lady's sake caused me pain. Our friendship had grown warm as we spent evenings together. As the lady and the dog clearly shared a strong affection, I knew suggesting separation would be cruel. The waif's audacious idea of setting up a practice near the lady's mansion to win her over amused me. However, my financial constraints made it difficult to help others in need, like the elderly Mrs. Willis, who required care and food. Despite my shy nature and lack of wealthy connections, I resolved to assist Mrs. Willis by providing food and arranging for medicine through a kind neighbor, Mrs. Jones.|"[""1.

After leaving Mrs. Willis, I was delayed with some patients, making it late before I headed west. The night was cold, with a biting December wind and dark clouds. As I approached the house where I left Dumps that morning, it was past midnight. I didn't know the lady's name or the house number, but I remembered the location and decided to check the door. In a cellar, two individuals sat on stools around a flour-barrel table with a candle in a bottle. They talked by a small fire. The man and boy discussed a plan involving a lost key and a doctor's house. The man mentioned a dog as a new obstacle. The boy was dunked in water to sober up before they planned to return in half an hour.|"['1.

The man left the cellar, leaving the boy exasperated. The boy dried himself with a towel and prepared for burglary. The house was quiet. The basement had a scullery connected to the kitchen. The scullery was turned into a bedroom for a dog named Dumps. The footman slept in the basement with a poker and pistol ready for burglars. The first floor rooms were dark and empty. Mrs. McTougall slept soundly on the drawing-room floor. In the nursery, four cribs and a cradle held the children. The children slept peacefully after their earlier mischief. The scene was calm and undisturbed, as Brassey and the Slogger aimed to steal quietly without waking anyone. Their goal was to get the plate without causing a commotion.|['1.

Late at night, a commotion stirred the house as a burglar, along with his accomplice, planned to break in. The dog, Dumps, innocently wagged his tail at the strange sight until he was seized and muzzled. The burglar, with a rope around Dumps' neck, aimed to keep the dog quiet while they carried out their plan.

"Very thoughtful of them to have a light already prepared for us,"" he whispered, as he dimmed the flame slightly and entered the kitchen, leaving the Slogger to watch in the scullery. Here, he discovered an array of traps and obstacles strategically placed for him - and others like him - by the strict directives of Mrs. McTougall. Alongside a bell on the window shutter, there were various items like a coal-scuttle with tongs leaning against it, a tin slop-pail with a kitchen shovel, and a watering-pan poised to fall at the slightest touch. These defenses spread across the floor made it impossible for an intruder to navigate the kitchen in darkness without triggering one or more of them. Guided by the lamp, Brassey cautiously made his way through with a wry smile. Moving silently up the stairs, the burglar entered the dining room, swiftly unlocked the sideboard, grabbed a canvas bag, and began collecting any valuable items he could find. Progressing to the drawing-room, he started examining and taking the most valuable-looking artifacts. Lacking expertise in such matters, Mr. Brassey was puzzled by some, spending a considerable amount of time on one piece before deeming it ""worth money.""

As I left Dr. McTougall's house, I heard Dumps, my dog, yelping in distress. Suddenly, chaos erupted as flames burst from the drawing-room. Panic set in, and I heard a gunshot and a scuffle.

The warm welcome I received from the doctor and his family paled in comparison to the exuberant greeting from Dumps, their beloved dog. Dumps, a loving creature with a spirit too large for his body, was playing with the McTougall baby when I arrived. Upon hearing my voice, he joyfully bounded down the stairs, his excitement evident in every wag of his tail and wriggle of his body. Despite slipping on the nursery floor and tumbling down the stairs, Dumps' overwhelming affection was unmistakable.

As I was deeply focused on my scientific studies, Lilly Blythe's return caused a pleasant yet distracting commotion. The admiration for this governess in our household was astonishing, almost like worship. Even I found myself joining in, along with Dumps and Robin. However, there was something peculiar about Miss Blythe's behavior that puzzled me. She expressed concern about Robin's exuberance, which led to chaotic games with the children. One evening, while I was out, Robin orchestrated a daring castle siege in the nursery, resulting in a calamitous mess.

Visiting their friend, they found her contemplative, gazing at a lively scene outside, contrasting her past sorrow.|"[""1.

"""Yes, Dr. McTougall has,"" she replied a bit grumpily. ""I've been feeling weak today and called him, but he thinks it's just my imagination. Well, maybe it is,"" she added with a sigh. ""I'm probably being silly."" ""No, granny,"" I said, ""you're not silly,"" (""On the contrary, quite the opposite,"" interrupted Slidder), ""and I'm glad I came in. Maybe I can help you too."" Suddenly, we heard pattering feet outside. The door burst open, and my dog rushed in, full of energy. There was a faint cry at the window. Edith's smile disappeared, and she turned pale, but then she saw her grandmother. With a cry of joy, Edith embraced her. The shock of joy almost overwhelmed the old lady, but we helped her to bed, and she soon recovered. Mrs. Willis was overjoyed, and Edith was full of happiness. As we left, Robin wiped his eyes, and Dumps looked surprised but not pleased. ""Punch is a smart dog,"" said Robin. ""Don't let your spirits fall, sir,"" he added wisely, ""he'll stick with you no matter what."""|"['1.
