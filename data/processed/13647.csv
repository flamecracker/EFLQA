"""Mr. Floppy Fly and Mr. Daddy Long-legs sat by the sea, pondering their unusual legs. Mr. Floppy Fly wished Mr. Daddy Long-legs would sing, but his legs were too long to allow him to.

Despite concerns from onlookers, they braved the stormy sea in their sieve, showing that being different can lead to unique adventures.
