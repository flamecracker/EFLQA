One day, as I strolled down the street with my open umbrella, I unexpectedly encountered Mr. Carrington, the chilly rector of St. John's church. The weather was flawless, with clear skies and mild sun, making my umbrella unnecessary.

Later, I realized he didn't know who the Kaiser was, making my response seem foolish. Nyoda shared a tale about Hercules, Uncle Jasper's coachman, who inherited a goat and a room in the stable after Uncle Jasper's passing. Despite the goat causing havoc, Nyoda couldn't part with it due to Hercules' attachment.

"Sahwah hesitated nervously, half afraid that the accomplished Colonial maid might also excel in her most valued skill. Elizabeth showed no hint of matching Sahwah's canoe abilities. Feeling confident in her own talents, Sahwah continued kindly, ""You can play the harp, though, something I can't do."" She touched the harp's gilt frame, admiring its strings and pedals. She refrained from playing, unlike Hinpoha. ""You must have looked stunning playing it,"" Sahwah said wistfully. ""No wonder Paul fell for you. I wish I could save a man's life.

Nyoda observed the two girls closely and noticed subtle differences in their characters. Agony appeared impulsive, enthusiastic, brilliant, and confident, yet also hot-headed and impatient. Oh-Pshaw, on the other hand, seemed less dominant, slower to understand, and less ardent. Although her eyes were not as bright, they reflected more thoughtfulness. Despite her less mischievous smile, Oh-Pshaw's facial lines suggested patience and perseverance. Nyoda, skilled in judging character, discerned these traits as she watched them. When Veronica, a baroness, entered, Hinpoha introduced her with great ceremony. Agony inquired about Veronica's Hungarian background, which caused a slight chill in the atmosphere. Nyoda intervened, diverting the conversation to Veronica's desire to be American. Agony's demeanor warmed, but Nyoda remained concerned that Veronica's noble lineage might be misunderstood due to the prevailing patriotic sentiments. She advised Veronica to be cautious about revealing her background to avoid any misinterpretations. Veronica agreed, acknowledging the need for discretion. Agony then shared her frustration with Hillsdale's consistent victories over Oakwood in various competitions, expressing a desire to beat them in an upcoming drill contest.

A chicken dashed past, followed by a figure in a bathrobe, trying to catch it. The girls encountered the unexpected duo, Slim and the Captain, celebrating Slim's birthday with a live chicken.

"""No,"" Sahwah explained. ""This is Many Eyes, our entry in the Boy Scout's kite-flying contest. We're taking her to Council Rock to be our official mascot and ensure victory."" Hinpoha, the mistress of ceremonies, announced, ""We'll perform a magic ritual to guarantee Many Eyes' success. First, we'll observe Indian Silence. We'll march silently to the woods in single file, carrying Many Eyes. Nobody should speak until we find a four-leaf clover."" The procession moved quietly, with Many Eyes leading the way. The group maintained silence until Nyoda realized the supper basket was missing. After a brief pause, they continued into the woods. The group finally found a patch of clover, and Sahwah discovered a four-leaf clover, a sign of good luck. Hinpoha carved stones with lucky symbols to attach to the kite's tail. They made wishes on the evening star and the new moon. As they prepared for the Council Fire, Nyoda placed Many Eyes on the rock, and the tribe gathered around to start the ceremonial fire. The clear call for the Wohelo tribe to join the Council Fire echoed through the woods, and shadowy figures emerged to form a circle around Nyoda as she kindled the fire. The group chanted softly as the fire sparked to life."|['1.

"The rhythmic chant echoed through the air, ""Keep rolling, keep rolling, Keep the fire sticks Briskly rolling, rolling, Grinding the wood dust, Smoke arises! Smoke arises!"" Nyoda skillfully caught the spark, fanning it into flames while the chant continued, ""Burn, fire, burn."" The Winnebagos rose, singing praises to Wohelo and their comrades. Agony and Oh-Pshaw were moved by the bond of affection among the Winnebagos, unlike their previous group that had drifted apart. Nyoda was the guiding light of the Winnebagos, revered by all.

After the ceremony, when Agony and Oh-Pshaw officially became Winnebagos, Agony expressed her deep desire to become a Torch Bearer. Nyoda, the leader, knew Agony's ambitious spirit but also saw that true leadership required humility and selflessness. Nyoda explained that earning the title of Torch Bearer wasn't just about collecting honor beads or reciting the Torch Bearer's Desire; it was about demonstrating consistent leadership, teamwork, and a willingness to put the group's needs above personal glory. Agony, confident in her leadership skills, eagerly awaited Nyoda's recognition. Meanwhile, Nyoda pondered if Oh-Pshaw, though kind and obliging, possessed the necessary strength and character for the role. The Camp Fire Girls reflected on Nyoda's words, each wondering if they truly lived up to her expectations as they sat by the dimming campfire, listening to the eerie sound of the water below.|"[""1.

Sahwah was puzzled by Oh-Pshaw's fear of water, finding it odd that her friend was terrified of something she loved. Agony and the others thought Oh-Pshaw was exaggerating, not realizing the deep-rooted cause of her fear. Oh-Pshaw's aversion to water stemmed from a traumatic childhood incident where she, as a baby, was in a boat accident with her parents. Though they were all rescued unharmed, the sound of the water haunted her ever since. Nyoda, knowing the truth, sympathized with Oh-Pshaw's fear, even though she pretended not to. The group, gathered in the woods, listened to the soothing sounds of water, but refrained from doing so that night out of consideration for Oh-Pshaw. As they left, a mishap with Many Eyes, a kite, brought disappointment, especially to Sahwah, who had put in much effort to create it.|"[""1.

Sahwah was determined and energized by Agony's challenge. She swiftly decided to prove the doubting Scout wrong by making another kite for the contest. With unwavering resolve, she rallied her friends to help her assemble the kite. Despite Agony's skepticism about the kite's appearance, Sahwah remained steadfast in her determination to enter it. The Winnebagos, including Migwan and Gladys, supported Sahwah's decision, emphasizing the importance of showing courage and determination. As they headed to Commons Field for the contest, Agony continued to express doubt about their chances of winning.

The competition was fierce as the different scout troops and associations unveiled their uniquely crafted kites. Sahwah, with her kite named Many Eyes, faced skepticism due to its unconventional design resembling a Primitive Woman. Despite the doubts, the Captain and Slim refrained from mocking her creation. Sahwah, feeling anxious, stood her ground, shielding her kite from judgment. As the kites took flight, Many Eyes surprised everyone by soaring effortlessly, leaving the other entries in awe. Despite initial laughter and doubts, Many Eyes emerged victorious, impressing all with its unexpected flying abilities.

During the contest, Sammy Boy and the Skyscraper, American Eagle, Mikado, and Victory Bird all faced challenges. Many Eyes, against all odds, emerged victorious above Victory Bird. The Winnebagos cheered loudly for Many Eyes, causing Agony, a proud Winnebago, to cheer the loudest. Hinpoha was amazed by Many Eyes' success despite lacking lucky symbols. After the contest, the group went rowing with Mr. Wing, the artist, Slim, and the Captain. Nyoda stayed behind with Oh-Pshaw. The Captain and Slim argued over who would row with Hinpoha, but she chose the artist's boat. Migwan and Mr. Wing rowed together, enjoying each other's company. Sahwah and Agony rowed with the Captain, who caught a crab, splashing them. Sahwah expressed her dislike for the artist to the Captain, while Hinpoha shared Veronica's story with Nyoda.

Migwan hurriedly fixed her finger pricked by the bell, sewed a new collar, and searched for a missing button. After all was sorted, she went downstairs to find everything under control and turned off unnecessary lights. Feeling exhausted, she noticed a flag in the window, representing Sherry, and straightened it out with teary eyes. She then went upstairs to help Nyoda get ready.

Sahwah woke up to the sound of a bell ringing in her ears. The house was quiet, with the sun shining brightly through the south window. She puzzled over the unusual sunlight, remembering the events of the previous night - a telegram, a rushed departure, and her return to Carver House without Nyoda. Suddenly, the doorbell rang, jolting Sahwah out of her thoughts. She hurried downstairs in her bathrobe, curious about the unexpected visitor. Agony then revealed a shocking story about a missing letter from her father's desk, implicating German agents in a wartime conspiracy. Veronica, a friend of Sahwah's, was suspected of taking the letter to protect a German Prince she knew.

"""I can't believe it!"" exclaimed Sahwah firmly. Her anger flared up, but doubt crept into her heart. ""Agony Wing,"" she protested, ""do you really think Veronica would work with enemy agents? Even if she knew that old prince, she disliked him. Do you honestly believe she would steal letters for him?""

""It does seem strange,"" Agony mused. ""Veronica always emphasized how much she wanted to be American. Papa and the Secret Service man were shocked too, but they are convinced she did it.""

""It turns out he's been suspicious of her all along; he doubted her sincerity about preferring America over her own country,"" Agony explained. ""He wasn't surprised at this; he had been expecting something like this. He informed papa and the Secret Service man about her acquaintance with the prince.""

Sahwah shared the startling news with the girls, and they hurried home with Agony. Mr. Wing led them to his study, where Veronica sat pale and anxious. An artist observed Veronica while a sharp-eyed man questioned them. Sahwah, torn between truth and secrecy, glanced at Veronica for guidance. The room fell silent as Agent Sanders fixed his gaze on Sahwah, who struggled to speak, her heart racing. Veronica finally broke the tension, saying, ""There were no circumstances involved.
