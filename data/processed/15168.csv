"After a short wait, Bowser decided to follow the sound of Blacky the Crow's familiar ""Caw, caw, caw"" calls. Despite his injured leg and stiffness from the cold, the sound comforted Bowser.

Reddy, the clever fox, was in a predicament. He knew that if the hens made noise, Farmer Brown's boy would come prepared, making Reddy's escape impossible. Time felt like it was dragging on forever as the hens were awake and near him. Reddy held still, not daring to move a muscle. Finally, he heard Farmer Brown's boy approaching to feed the hens.

Where was Bowser the Hound? Everyone was puzzled by his disappearance, including Farmer Brown's family and the little woodland creatures who knew him. While most were clueless about his whereabouts, two individuals had some inkling. Old Man Coyote, who had led Bowser astray, hoped he wouldn't return. On the other hand, Blacky the Crow knew where Bowser was but kept it a secret for his own amusement. Meanwhile, Farmer Brown's boy searched tirelessly, fearing the worst.

Poor Bowser looked miserable as he hobbled down the road, tail and head drooping, limping on three legs. His eyes showed pain and suffering, whining and whimpering. Suddenly, a smell tickled his nose, not a track but smoke in the air. Realizing a house was nearby, he gathered strength and hurried on. Approaching a farmyard, the scent of cooking food mixed with chimney smoke grew stronger. Despite his eagerness, Bowser could only whine at the back door. A kind woman found him and took him in, caring for his injured leg. Bowser, now a prisoner of kindness, was fed, comforted, and given a warm place by the stove. The act of kindness made him a prisoner in a good way, as he slept peacefully, recovering from his ordeal.|"[""1.

The following day, Bowser felt much improved but was still stiff and sore, making it hard for him to move. He was well taken care of and pampered, but as the days passed, he longed to return home. The man of the house noticed that Bowser didn't belong in the area and decided to keep him safe until they could find his owner. Bowser, although grateful for the care, missed Farmer Brown's boy and his true home. Despite the kindness shown to him, he felt like a prisoner and yearned for the familiar sights and sounds of home.

One day, Farmer Brown's boy heard about a strange dog found in the next township. Filled with hope, he drove there but found it wasn't Bowser. Despite giving up hope of seeing Bowser again, he searched for him whenever he was away. Bowser's deep, clear voice was unique, heard miles away when hunting. Now, in a new home, Bowser's homesickness made him bay mournfully, reaching Blacky the Crow. Blacky knew Bowser was homesick but couldn't help.

Blacky the Crow flew back towards the Green Forest and the Old Pasture near Farmer Brown's to search for Old Man Coyote. He listened to Bowser's homesick howls as he flew. Blacky was cautious, as he knew Old Man Coyote could be dangerous. By the time he reached the Green Forest, it was getting dark, and Blacky hurried to his roost before the night shadows crept in. Blacky, despite his dark feathers, was afraid of the dark because of Hooty the Owl, who would gladly make a meal of him. The next morning, Blacky found Old Man Coyote returning from a hunt. Blacky, being sly, offered to help locate Bowser the Hound, who was lost and homesick. However, Old Man Coyote laughed off the idea, showing no interest in helping Bowser return home.|"[""1.

When Blacky hinted about Bowser the Hound, Reddy's eyes widened briefly, but he quickly regained his composure. Blacky slyly tried to get Reddy to help Bowser without his knowledge. Reddy, however, avoided the topic and changed it abruptly.

Reddy Fox saw Blacky the Crow disappear in the distance and thought about the chickens Blacky mentioned. Feeling hungry, Reddy pondered how to find the farm with the chickens. He considered if Blacky had gone that way and decided to rest to stay fit for the search. As he dozed off, Reddy dreamt of plump hens waiting to be caught.

Blacky the Crow found great amusement in fooling Reddy Fox. Blacky pretended to rest in a tall tree, secretly watching Reddy approach. Reddy, thinking he was deceiving Blacky, was actually being outsmarted. Blacky chuckled as Reddy tried to act weak and tired.

For a while, Reddy listened intently while Blacky watched him closely. Reddy's suspicion grew as he realized he might have been tricked by Blacky. Chuckling silently, Blacky waited until Reddy showed signs of unease before speaking. Blacky teased Reddy about his apparent weakness earlier that morning. Startled by Blacky's voice, Reddy admitted feeling better at the thought of the nearby hens. A rooster's crow confirmed their proximity, and Reddy's demeanor changed instantly.

Reddy carefully scanned the area for any signs of a dog, but none were in sight. He deduced that if there was a dog, it must be either in the barn or the house. Convinced that no Fox had troubled the plump hens, Reddy fought the urge to pounce on one immediately. He lay low behind a tree trunk, plotting his next move. Patient and strategic, Reddy knew that rushing in would only spook the hens and alert the farmhouse. He waited, knowing that a calculated approach would yield better results. Reddy's hunger gnawed at him, but he resisted the impulse to act impulsively. Instead, he devised a plan to nab a hen without causing a commotion.

In an instant, the farmhouse door burst open, and a man emerged with a dog following close behind. Blacky, the crow, noticed the man's swift actions and sensed trouble near the barn. He suspected a fox was involved. The man, realizing something was amiss, called his dog and hurried to investigate. Meanwhile, Reddy the Fox, clutching a plump hen, heard the approaching man and dog. Knowing it was Bowser the Hound on his trail, Reddy's heart sank. He had to think quickly to outsmart Bowser and save the hen.

Only two creatures knew the truth about Reddy Fox's missing fat hen hidden in the hollow stump. Blacky the Crow was one of them.

Blacky felt proud of outsmarting Reddy and leading Bowser back home. He followed Reddy and saw him hide the hen.
