"""I doubt if it's that close,"" the Old Year replied, smiling gravely. ""You'll soon tire of seeking it and turn to the affairs of a small city like Salem for amusement, as I have done. Here we are at the steps of the new City Hall, completed during my time. Politics is like a game here, with Burning Ambition, Patriotism, and virtuous Economy at play. The Aldermen and Common Council mirror the bigger political scene. Human strengths and weaknesses, passion, and policy are on display. I've opened the Railroad, bringing new life to Salem. The town will shed old prejudices and embrace change. Wealth's influence may diminish, and new faces and ideas will shape the future. I've collected tokens of the past year, now to be stored away. My wish is for the betterment and happiness of all."""|"[""1.
