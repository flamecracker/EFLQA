Initially, capping the oil well was challenging due to the strong flow of oil and gas. A man with a similar machine was spotted nearby, filming the oil well. Russ and his team chased after the man, but he managed to escape. The train could resume its journey safely after the oil well was successfully capped. Russ suspected that the rival team had been spying on them to copy their work. Mr. Pertell revealed that the rival team had been trying to harm him for years. As a result of the change in plans, the company had to stay overnight in a small town before continuing their journey.|"['1.

Miss Dixon, accustomed to fine dining, wrinkled her nose at the unpleasant smell. Russ shared a tale of a German farmer storing sauerkraut for illness. Despite the hotel's modesty, the meal was satisfying. However, Miss Pennington, Miss Dixon, and Mr. Sneed found fault. Miss Dixon panicked, mistaking a brown bear for danger. Alice, terrified, sought refuge in her father's room. Mr. Sneed's encounter with the bear led to a comical moment with Mr. Towne, who recognized the bear as a trained one named Bruno. The hotel manager assured everyone of Bruno's gentle nature.|"['1.

Alice overheard the conversation and reassured Ruth that everything was safe. Mr. Sneed returned, and Tony, the bear's owner, retrieved Mr. Towne's cane that the bear had mistaken for a prop. Mr. Pertell, seizing the moment, suggested filming a story with the bear, Bruno, like Little Red Riding Hood. Mr. Switzer bravely fed Bruno pretzels, showing no fear. The group then arrived in Kansas for filming on a farm. As a storm approached, everyone sought shelter in a cellar. Despite warnings, Russ captured the cyclone on camera. The wind damaged buildings, but the storm passed quickly. The sun reappeared, and they emerged from the cellar unharmed.|['1.

The farmer surveyed the damage caused by the cyclone, relieved that his buildings had escaped major destruction. Despite the chaos, no one was injured. Russ, capturing the aftermath on film, marveled at the resilience of the farmer who remained optimistic. The farmer, accustomed to such storms, chuckled at the situation, emphasizing the occasional nature of tornadoes in Kansas. Assessing the damage, they found it less severe than expected, with only one cow lost. As they prepared to leave for Altmore station, Miss Dixon grew anxious, urging the train to return.

The dust settled as several wagons appeared, pulled by sturdy horses. Surrounded by cowboys, they lacked the typical sheepskin breeches seen in movies about the wild west, likely due to the hot weather. The cowboys had come to escort the ladies to the ranch for filming. Despite some rowdiness, the ladies reassured them they wanted an authentic experience, including the firing of guns. The foreman, Pete Batso, introduced himself and explained the branding of cattle. As they prepared to depart, the cowboys loaded the ladies' belongings while the group got into the wagons. The ranch, Rocky Ranch, was ready for their visit, showcasing the Circle and Dot brand on the ponies.|"['1.

The pace at Rocky Ranch was swift, matching the speed of life in the West. Horses galloped, cowboys rode, and even the wagons raced along. The ranch, nestled in a picturesque area, boasted rolling land and a nearby stream. Mr. Haladay Norton, the ranch owner, oversaw a vast expanse of cattle. The ranch was equipped with buildings and accommodations for cowboys and guests, making it one of the finest in the region. As the visitors were introduced to the colorful characters of the ranch, they were treated to a celebratory welcome.

In the twilight after supper, the players explored Rocky Ranch. The structures, all single-story as mentioned by Mr. Norton, boasted wide verandas where one could relax in comfort. The cowboys had their bunkhouse, while the Chinese cook and assistants had their living quarters. The cowboys, intrigued by the visitors, gathered, admiring the well-dressed men and pretty girls. Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon entertained the cowboys with a sketch, using a side porch as a stage. The cowboys were skilled riders, impressing the girls with their abilities. The next day promised busy times at the ranch, with scenes of cattle branding planned. The cowboys expertly handled the cattle, showcasing their skills to the film crew.|['1.

Pete Batso reassured Miss that the cows are used to being roped gently. He explained that the hot iron only crimps the hair like curling with a hot slate pencil. The foreman assured that the steer wouldn't escape. The cowboys roped and branded the steer. Suddenly, the steer charged at Mr. Bunn, who narrowly avoided being gored. The foreman wasn't prepared to rope the steer again. Quickly, Pete roped the steer, bringing it down.

The Shakespearean actor, known for his self-importance, eventually agreed to showcase the film. He suggested turning it into a play like 'Quo Vadis?' The aggressive steer was held back until the actors left. Once free, it lost its hostility. Pete Batso explained that cattle are used to mounted riders and may act aggressively towards those on foot. The actors then practiced horseback riding, except Mrs. Maguire. Alice excelled in riding, with Baldy Johnson as her instructor. She enjoyed it immensely, feeling invigorated. Meanwhile, Mr. Pertell and Russ kept an eye out for rival filmmakers. Alice, Ruth, and others went for a ride, avoiding a sacred Indian site where ceremonies were held.

The cowboy mentioned that the Indians had no right to leave their reservation, but they did so anyway. The area was remote, making it challenging to send troops to drive them back. The cowboys and Indians coexisted peacefully without bothering each other. The mesa, with its purple glow and golden foothills, provided a beautiful backdrop. Ruth and Alice were well-liked by the cowboys for their natural and girlish demeanor. They were becoming skilled horseback riders, along with the other members of the company. One day, a prank involving a bucking bronco caused Mr. Bunn to take an unexpected fall. Though shaken, he was unharmed. This incident led to changes in the filming plans to avoid further conflicts.

"""It seems the Native Americans are preparing for their traditional 'medicine' ceremony,"" Baldy informed the group. ""Let me handle this. I can communicate in their language and explain that your camera has powerful 'medicine',"" he assured Russ. ""Hopefully, that will prevent them from harming it.""

""I can hear their horses nearby, tied just beyond those trees,"" Baldy continued, pointing in the direction of the sounds. Suddenly, a pony whinnied, prompting a response from Baldy's horse. Emerging from the trees were around a hundred primitive huts, constructed from branches and covered with cowhides or colorful blankets.

As the group observed, a diverse and intimidating group of painted Native Americans emerged from the huts. Despite their fierce appearance, Baldy reassured the others that he would handle the situation. He explained that the tribe wanted them to stay for a couple of days to respect their ceremonies, causing concern among the group.

Some of the Native Americans retreated into the huts, possibly resting before the ceremony. Others headed to the grove to guard the horses and prevent any escape attempts. The chief then entered a separate hut. Baldy expressed his frustration at being outsmarted by one of them for the first time. The chief explained the significance of the upcoming ceremony and insisted they stay. Mr. DeVere suggested a different approach to convince them to let them go. Eventually, they were assigned cleaner huts and offered food. The group was divided among the huts, with Ruth and Alice getting the best one.

Left to themselves, closely watched by the Indians, the captives prepared for their stay. They had blankets for warmth and improvised using tin cans as dishes. Baldy, with his camping gear, brewed coffee over a small fire, lifting their spirits. The Indians performed mysterious ceremonies, dancing and howling around a fire. Russ discreetly filmed the rituals. As the day passed, the captives grew anxious. Baldy devised a plan to send a smoke signal using wet wood and a blanket to alert their friends. Despite the Indians' warnings, Baldy was determined to seek help. Russ captured the entire event on film, which later fascinated audiences in New York.|"['1.

The smoke signal caused trouble for Paul and Baldy. After sending the message, some angry Indians returned. They rushed towards the prisoners, but Jumping Horse intervened, preventing any violence. The Indians held a conference but did not punish the prisoners immediately. As dusk fell, the Indians continued their ceremonies. Suddenly, cowboys from Rocky Ranch arrived, having seen the smoke signal. The cowboys fired shots in the air to signal their arrival.

Bow explained that they had searched for the missing young ladies and the film crew the previous night. When they couldn't find any trace of them, they were surprised to discover them on the mesa. Alice, though disheveled from being held captive, reassured everyone that they were safe. The group then mounted their horses and headed back down to the plain, with the cowboys as escorts. As they shared their adventures over a meal, the girls became the center of attention, much to the annoyance of Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon. The cowboys suggested a plan to stop a stampede by herding the steers in a circle. The scene unfolded with excitement and danger as the cattle stampede veered towards the young ladies, prompting a swift response from Mr. Norton and the cowboys to avert a real crisis.|"[""1.

A group of cowboys raced to rescue four girls in danger of being trampled by a stampede of cattle. The cowboys, with winded horses, tried to divert the steers away. The girls waved parasols to scare the cattle, while the cowboys used blank cartridges and real bullets to stop the rush. The steers were diverted, and the girls were safe. The cowboys and the Comet Film Company discussed recent events. The cowboys searched for the strange men but returned empty-handed. The film crew explained the process of shooting scenes out of order and later arranging them correctly in the final film.|['1.

"The manager excitedly announced plans for an outdoor adventure with the cowboys and actresses. They would film scenes of cowboy life on the round-up, sleeping under the stars and living in wagons. Despite potential discomfort, the experience was anticipated to be enjoyable. The group prepared old-fashioned wagons for the ladies to live in when not riding, including a ""grub"" wagon for food. The filming had its challenges, but everyone remained positive. One night, a crucial film reel went missing, causing concern. The young operator assured Russ he took great care of the reels, but the missing one was nowhere to be found. This unexpected mystery added a new twist to their outdoor filming experience."|['1.

"""Look!"" exclaimed Mr. DeVere, who followed the two into the tent. ""That's how your reel was taken!"" and he pointed to a slit in the wall, close to where the black box stood. The cut was so clean, made with a sharp tool, only noticeable when the wind moved the canvas. ""By Jove! You're right!"" cried Mr. Pertell. ""That's how they got it, Russ. Someone sneaked up, slit it open, reached in, and took the reel while we were asleep,"" Russ said ruefully as he showed the slit to the cowboys and others.

"""Don't worry,"" assured the manager. ""It will just be a small, pretend fire. I want to capture some scenes of that,"" he continued, explaining to the cowboys. Prairie fires were a significant danger in the early days of the West. Nowadays, with the West more developed, they are less common. However, we could simulate a small one, burning the grass over a limited area, creating a dramatic effect for the film. Elaborate preparations were made for this scene, crucial in the drama ""East and West."" The climax depicted the hardships faced by an early Western settler during a prairie fire. The realistic portrayal was made possible by Pop Snooks' construction skills and clever camera work.

"""Ride! Ride for safety!"" urged Mr. Sneed, perched on his horse, prepared to battle the fire. With urgency, he gestured towards a supposed safe spot. Paul, at the reins, spurred the horses forward, while Ruth, Alice, and the rest in the wagon glanced back at their imperiled home. After a brief farewell, Mr. Sneed and Mr. DeVere rode back to aid in extinguishing the flames. Meanwhile, Baldy and the cowboys worked to douse the fire, captured on film by Mr. Pertell. As the fire spread, a plan to fight it with a counter-fire failed, worsening the situation. Horses and plows were brought in by settlers to assist.

Alice assured the group they were welcome to sit but turning back was impossible due to the thick black clouds of smoke and shooting flames. Mr. Switzer, remarkably calm, warned against attempting to turn back as the horses would panic. Instead, he suggested trying the left where the smoke seemed less dense. The refugees hurried back into the wagon as Paul guided the horses, risking a desperate chance to evade the encroaching fire. The group anxiously watched the flames closing in from both directions as the wagon rocked over the uneven ground. Russ, determined to capture the scene, readied his camera despite the perilous situation.

The horses were restrained, and the clamor of their galloping and the wagon's creaking faded. Shouts of cowboys and gunshots broke the silence. Above the tumult, cries of relief signaled some survivors. The girls wept with joy, though worry lingered. As the wagon raced toward safety, cowboys and the film crew, led by Mr. DeVere, rode to catch up. Mr. Switzer urged the horses on, aiming for the water to escape the encroaching fire. Russ filmed the scene, capturing the chaos and heroism. He waded through the creek, filming the fire's destruction. Nearby, worn-out riders sought shelter. Suspicion arose about the fire's origin. The tense atmosphere eased as the cowboys departed, and the group settled for a meal.|"[""1.

After a long chase, the tired cowboys led by Baldy Johnson returned to camp at dusk. The prairie fire was almost out, with only a faint glow remaining where the grass still smoldered. Russ put away his camera, recognizing one of the cowboys from Rocky Ranch. The manager worried about more mischief, as they had important films to make. Buster suspected the cowboys of starting the fire and stampeding cattle. The camp was quickly set up by the creek, away from the blaze. Mr. Pertell decided to halt filming to deal with their rivals. The suspected cowboys were captured, revealing their plans. The gang's headquarters was found, along with the missing film. The cowboys drove away the troublemakers, ending the ordeal. Later, a grand cowboy festival was planned for the final scene of the drama.|"['1.
