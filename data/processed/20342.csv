Grace blushed slightly at Louise's words, feeling valued for her role in overseeing the thirty-four girls under her care. Despite trying to push thoughts of Tom Gray away, Louise's gaze reminded her of him. Determined to focus on work, Grace discussed the day's tasks with the cook. Interrupted by the postman, she found joy in letters from loved ones. Her mother's supportive message contrasted with Tom's disapproval of her work. Inspired, Grace devoted herself to the well-being of Harlowe House. During a meeting, Louise proposed fundraising ideas, met with differing opinions.

For the next thirty minutes, the club discussed a plan to boost their funds. A committee was formed with Mary, Evelyn, Nettie, and Ethel, known for her excellent recitations. Nettie suggested a Service Bureau where students could request help with tasks like mending or tutoring. Since many at Harlowe House work to support themselves, the idea was well-received. They planned set hours for the bureau to operate. Grace offered to set up a desk in the living room for the service. Suddenly, a visitor arrived, and Jean, feeling unwell, excused herself.

Club members were busy tutoring freshmen and sewing silk blouses, kimonos, and gowns. Grace set up a sewing room with two machines that were always in use. Students requested services like hairdressing and manicures, gladly supporting their peers in need. Grace and Louise put in hours to ensure the success of the venture, carefully assigning tasks to girls based on their skills. The Bureau gained popularity as students showcased hidden talents.

Ten girls came to Jean's sale and were delighted as they explored her beautiful wardrobe. Her gowns fit them well, and they were thrilled by the freshness and bargains. Each girl spent her allowance eagerly, filling Jean's hands with money. A trying-on session followed, with chatter like magpies. Passersby were curious about the laughter from Harlowe House girls. After the last girl left, Jean hurriedly packed her remaining garments into a trunk before Evelyn returned. Jean had saved a yellow crêpe frock for Evelyn as a Christmas gift, along with shoes, stockings, a scarf, and a white evening coat. Despite their differences, Jean valued their friendship.

Grace was torn between the excitement of meeting a new friend and the sadness of saying goodbye to Overton College's loyal supporter.

As Grace approached, a sense of foreboding crept over her, making her hesitant to meet Miss Wharton. Upon entering Miss Wilder's office, Grace's initial impression of Miss Wharton was unfavorable. The dean's demeanor and cold response to Grace's greeting left her feeling uncomfortable. Despite this, Grace tried to maintain a friendly attitude.

Grace observed the new dean with serious attention. She wondered if the dean's speech was merely formal or carried a hint of ill intent. Not since her days at Oakdale High School, where a math teacher named Miss Leece had made algebra a difficult subject, had Grace encountered an instructor who reminded her of someone she disliked. Despite her growing aversion, Grace tried to respond politely. She felt a sense of discord between herself and the new dean, much like the one she had with Miss Leece. As the conversation progressed, Grace felt excluded by the dean's deliberate actions. However, a kind gesture from Miss Wilder softened Grace's feelings. Grace left with a resolve to visit Miss Wilder the next day, hoping to understand the dean better.

"Before she had time to carry out her intention John appeared pushing a small table on wheels ahead of him. Its shelves were laden with sandwiches, olives, salted nuts and delicious fancy cakes, while a maid followed him with a chocolate service. Mrs. Gray poured the chocolate, and Anne, always her right-hand man, assisted her in serving it. Grace, with her ever-present youthfulness of spirit, found trundling the table about the room a most pleasing diversion. They were a very merry little company, entering into the joy of being together with all their hearts, and deeply thankful for the opportunity to gather once more in the same spirit of friendly affection that had characterized all their meetings.

""Yes, do. Miriam and David are coming over for a while,"" returned wily Grace. Her one idea was to avoid being alone with Tom. His sole idea was to be alone with her. His pride, however, would allow him to go no further. He had been rebuffed twice in rapid succession.

After his aunt's guests had departed with much merriment and laughter, Tom turned to go upstairs. He was sure Grace did not intend to be unkind. It was not her fault if she did not love him. He had determined, however, to plead with her once more. Then, if she still remained obdurate, as he feared she might, he would give up all hope of her, forever, and go his lonely way in the world.

Grace found herself reflecting on Tom Gray's sacrifice and began to sympathize with him as she prepared to spend Easter alone. Her friends were all away, and she was the only one left in Oakdale.
