"During Christmas Eve, a unique event took place in New York City. A group of people gathered at the tomb of the author of ""A Visit from St. Nicholas"" after their church service. They recited the famous poem, known as ""'Twas the Night before Christmas,"" written by Dr. Clement C. Moore. The poem was originally a gift for his children, but it became widely popular and translated into many languages. Despite Dr. Moore's other accomplishments, he is most remembered for this poem. Even blind children read it in Braille. Every Christmas Eve, students at the General Theological Seminary honor Dr. Moore by placing a holly wreath around his picture. The timeless words of the poem are complemented by new illustrations in this edition, created by Miss Jessie Willcox Smith. It captures the magic of Christmas Eve that all children cherish."|"['1.
