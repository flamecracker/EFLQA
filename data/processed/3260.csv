The first settlers have a better chance to establish themselves if they are open to learning; resilient plants will replace delicate ones if left undisturbed. The shorter, darker individuals are integral to the Welsh and British populations. Despite their language fading, a few place names remain. Languages change more swiftly than races. Losing a language doesn't mean a race is extinct; it shows a willingness to adapt and evolve. Some groups easily adopt new languages, like the Danes and Slavs. Others hold onto their languages, like the Spanish and English speakers. Following the short, dark race, a tall, fair-haired group arrived armed with iron tools, overpowering the previous inhabitants. The conquerors initially saw themselves as superior but eventually integrated with the locals. The Celtic language, an Aryan language, is still spoken in various regions. Mixing different races enriches a nation's culture and potential. Wales, with its diverse faces and characters, exemplifies this blend of backgrounds. The movement of peoples has continued throughout history, shaping the Welsh landscape and its people.|['1.

The migration is ongoing. Explore the history of an upland Welsh parish, and you'll discover that old families, high and low, have made way for newcomers in a remarkably short time. Trace the trains transporting emigrants from Hull or London to Liverpool heading westâ€”they resemble the blue-eyed, yellow-haired arrivals from two thousand years ago. However, America has now become their new destination. Periodically, the Welsh feel the urge to wander due to food scarcity, population density, oppression, or a desire for freedom. Hunger and a vivid imagination prompted groups of adventurers to seek new lands. This cycle of exploration and renewal is how every nation rejuvenates itself. Rome, for instance, emphasized the need for order and law alongside adventure. The memory of Rome's influence lingered in Wales, notably through a significant battle fought near the Berwyn. Caratacus led the Britons in a fierce battle against the Romans, ultimately surrendering and being paraded in Rome. The battle stirred the Silures to intensify their resistance, prolonging Roman conquest efforts. Agricola's arrival brought wisdom and Roman peace, leading to the construction of towns, roads, and the flourishing of agriculture and mining in Wales.|"['1.

The Romans permitted Welsh families and tribes to keep their own leaders but took charge of defending the country. As Rome's power declined, it struggled to maintain control over distant lands like Britain. The empire faced threats from invading nations on its borders, weakening its hold. Rome's harsh rule in war and selfishness in peace led to its downfall. In 410, Alaric and the Goths attacked Rome, symbolizing the empire's vulnerability. Despite Rome's fall, some believed it was due to rejecting the gods. Christianity spread in Britain during Roman rule, with legends of apostles and biblical figures influencing its growth. By 500, the British Church separated from Rome, leading to differences in practices and beliefs. Ultimately, Wales aligned with the Roman Church, ending religious independence.|"[""1.

During the turbulent times in Wales, the Church steadily grew in influence. Churches sprang up everywhere, bearing names that reflected the beliefs of their time. Initially named after their founders, churches later became dedicated to Archangel Michael and then to Mary, the Mother of Christ. Despite civil unrest and wavering faith among the people, Christianity prevailed against attempts by old pagan beliefs to resurface. Various figures emerged throughout the centuries, advocating different aspects of faith and reform within the Church. From monks emphasizing prayer and labor's nobility to the translation of the Bible into Welsh by Bishop Morgan, the religious landscape in Wales evolved. Despite these advancements, remnants of old pagan worship persisted, with beliefs in ancient gods like Lud of the Silver Hand and Merlin still lingering.|"['1.

During ancient times, Wales faced invasions from various tribes like the Picts and Teutonic groups. The Angles and Saxons settled in different regions of Britain, bringing new languages and religions. The Danes, feared for their quick attacks, also posed a threat. Kings like Rhodri Mawr and his grandson Howel the Good defended Wales against these enemies. They fought battles on land and sea, striving for peace and unity. Despite challenges from the Mercians and Wessex Earls, Wales, under leaders like Llywelyn ab Seisyll and Griffith, sought prosperity. However, conflicts with the Danes and English, especially Harold, led to unrest. Arthur, a legendary figure symbolizing courage and justice, is believed to embody the spirit of Welsh resistance.

In the past, Wales was governed by two main principles: a desire for order and a yearning for independence. The risk of too much order was the possibility of oppression, while too much independence could lead to chaos and weakness. At times, Wales was united under leaders like Maelgwn or Rhodri, with other local princes ruling independently. Howel the Good played a significant role in shaping Wales by compiling its laws around 950. Although it was ideal to have one king ruling the entire country, Wales was mostly divided into smaller kingdoms like Gwynedd, Powys, Ceredigion, Deheubarth, Dyved, Morgannwg, and Gwent. Each kingdom had its own unique characteristics and laws. The social structure in Wales included free high-born individuals and lower-born serfs, with opportunities for social mobility over time. The king's household was a place of importance where various officials served different roles.|"['1.

Old Welsh law differed greatly from modern law. It was known for its fairness and lack of harsh punishments. The laws of Gwynedd demanded hefty fines for violence in the presence of the king, including cows, a white bull with red ears, gold rods, and plates. Judges were required to be learned, just, and wise, undergoing a year of training before taking office. Falconers were important officers, tasked with caring for the king's falcons. William, the Norman Conqueror, aimed to conquer Wales after England. The Normans, known for wisdom and courage, were determined to expand their territory into Wales. Hugh of Avranches, a Norman baron, established himself at Chester to oversee the conquest of Wales. Robert, a follower of Hugh, extended the Earl of Chester's dominion, showing cruelty that even shocked his fellow Normans.|"[""1.

At Shrewsbury, where the Severn river changes direction southwards from the Welsh mountains, Roger of Montgomery and his wife Mabel resided. Roger, a skilled negotiator, preferred persuasion over violence, unlike Hugh of Chester. Together with his sons, they established a castle at Montgomery. Meanwhile, William Fitz-Osbern, a capable follower of the Conqueror, settled in Hereford on the Wye river. He explored Wales and left his sons William and Roger behind. William inherited his father's wisdom, while Roger's rebellious nature led to imprisonment. Bernard of NeufmarchÃ© then took charge, building a castle at Brecon and claiming territories along the Wye and Usk rivers. Further south, William the Conqueror arrived in Cardiff, contributing to the rapid Norman conquest of the Welsh coast. The Normans' success was due to their trained soldiers, superior weaponry, and strategic castle-building skills, contrasting with the disorganized Welsh resistance.|"['1.

By 1255, Llywelyn ap Griffith emerged as the sole ruler, engaging in a prolonged conflict with Edward, the Earl of Chester. Llywelyn sought to reclaim his grandfather's authority in Wales, uniting the Welsh chiefs against English rule. Through alliances with the barons, Llywelyn expanded his influence, culminating in the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267, recognizing him as Prince of Wales. However, a subsequent conflict between 1267 and 1277 saw Edward and Llywelyn at odds, resulting in Llywelyn's territorial loss and the end of his title as Prince of Wales.|"[""1.

Between 1277 and 1282, there was a significant conflict. The Welsh people rebelled against new rulers, seeking protection from Llywelyn, especially his brother David. Despite efforts by Eleanor, Llywelyn's wife, and Edward's cousin, to maintain peace, she passed away during preparations for the final war in 1282. Edward faced challenges in conquering Powys or Deheubarth due to the impregnable nature of Gwynedd. The mountainous region of Snowdon served as a natural barrier, making it difficult for invaders to penetrate. Edward needed a substantial army and financial resources to confront Llywelyn's forces. Eventually, Edward's army surrounded Snowdon, forcing Llywelyn's allies to surrender or flee. Llywelyn's death in a skirmish led to the Welsh losing faith and ultimately surrendering to Edward. The conflict was not solely between England and Wales, as Welsh soldiers fought on both sides. Despite differing views, both Edward and Llywelyn believed they were justified in their actions. Today, Wales enjoys freedom within a united Britain, reflecting the historical complexities of this conflict.|"['1.

In ancient times, Wales was considered more civilized than England. While Welsh law was simpler than English law, it was often fairer and more humane. In Wales, land ownership was more equal, giving all sons an equal chance. Additionally, in cases of crime, the punishment was often more merciful compared to the brutal practices in England. For instance, during the reign of John and Edward I, Welsh hostages faced cruel fates for their fathers' actions. The Welsh rulers, like Griffith ap Conan and Llywelyn the Great, were energetic and far-sighted leaders, akin to Henry II. Their characters were often more endearing than many English kings. Despite the conquest of Wales by English kings, the Welsh language and culture persisted, showing signs of a rich civilization. Wales was divided into shires by English rulers, but the old Welsh laws and customs endured. The Norman-conquered Wales in the east and south had its own unique laws and ruling families, subject to the English king but often acting as independent lords. Llywelyn, the last independent Welsh prince, marked the end of an era, with the title of Prince of Wales passing to the English crown. The current Prince of Wales descends from the ancient House of Cunedda, linking back to the earliest Welsh royal lineage.|"['1.

Warfare has two sides: attack and defense. The constant development of new methods for both attack and defense leads to significant changes in the world. When defense strategies are superior to attack strategies, little change occurs as the strong can maintain their gains. Conversely, when attacking methods are more advanced, new opportunities arise, sparking numerous transformations. Castles were the primary defense structures, while the long-bow was a key weapon for attacks. Wales boasts exemplary castles and is renowned for the long-bow. From 1066 to 1284, England and Wales were conquered and fortified with castles. Subsequently, from 1284 to 1461, England and Wales used the long-bow to launch successful attacks. Various strategies emerged for storming castles, including scaling walls with ladders, using mangonels to hurl stones, and mining to breach walls. To counter mining, defenders dug moats, built brattices, and constructed stronger towers. The Edwardian castles, like Caerphilly, featured concentric designs with multiple layers of defense. These castles were vital in Edward's efforts to control Wales.|['1.

There were two main types of bows used in warfare: the cross-bow and the long-bow. The cross-bow was initially designed for defending towns and required strength and precision. It had a mechanism to draw the string back along a wooden piece, allowing the archer to take aim carefully. In contrast, the long-bow was a simple yet powerful weapon made of sinewy yew and a string. It required instant aim and was drawn to the ear, making it deadly in battle. The long-bow was instrumental in breaking the lines of the Snowdon lances and pikes during the Welsh wars and later proved effective against the nobles of France. Additionally, the decline in the value of money and the rise of towns and commerce played significant roles in transforming the economic and social landscape during this period.|['1.

The Norman and English Conquests boosted trade, leading to the rise of towns with established markets. Barons protected merchants in exchange for tolls, fostering a thriving trade environment. Every baron had a castle, necessitating walled towns that relied on trade for survival. In these towns, individuals were judged based on their skills rather than their social status. The Church condemned serfdom, advocating for freedom. The Black Death pandemic drastically reduced the labor force, empowering laborers to demand higher wages. This led to conflicts between laborers and lords, resulting in revolts like the Peasant Revolt in England and Owen Glendowerâ€™s rebellion in Wales. Ultimately, with the demise of Owen of Wales in 1378, the era of rebellions against the English monarchy in Wales concluded.|"['1.

In Wales, the English barons tried to seize lands from Welsh freemen, causing unrest. The barons used primogeniture, passing all to their eldest son, while the Welsh followed gavelkind, dividing lands among sons. The barons took waste lands, leading to conflict. Owen Glendower, a Welsh squire, resisted Lord Grey's encroachment. After Henry IV's weak rule, Owen rebelled in 1400. The rebellion spread, with Owen hailed as a hero by the bard, friar, and peasant. Owen's rapid success was attributed to magic. He aimed to establish an independent Wales with a unique government, church, and education system. Despite setbacks, Owen sought alliances to secure Wales' independence and the Mortimer family's claim to the throne.|"['1.

During the reign of Henry V, Wales saw glorious victories in France, while under Henry VI, it faced tragic losses. Lords gained power in Wales and England, weakening the king's grip. Lords controlled Parliament, appointed the Council, and influenced the courts. To be safe, one needed a lord's protection. Over a hundred lords ruled castles in Wales, allowing criminals to escape justice. This led to private wars and chaos. The lords split into two factionsâ€”the Red Rose of Lancaster led by Henry VI, and the White Rose of York. In the Wars of the Roses, these families fought for power and land. Wales divided too, with the west supporting Lancaster and the east favoring York. Welsh barons like Jasper Tudor and William Herbert chose sides based on their interests, leading to a turbulent time in Welsh history.|"[""1.

One significant battle during the Wars of the Roses was Mortimer's Cross in February 1461, where the Welsh Yorkists clashed with the Welsh Lancastrians. The young Duke of York emerged victorious and was crowned as King Edward IV later that year. The brutality of the battles was evident as noble prisoners were mercilessly executed, even children. Welsh barons played crucial roles, with North Wales archers fighting for Lancaster at Towton in 1461. The Welsh were divided, with traitors like Grey of Ruthin switching sides. The conflict reached Wales, with Harlech's defense for Lancaster becoming legendary. The final battle, Tewkesbury in 1471, saw Lancaster's defeat. Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, became the Lancastrian heir, eventually defeating Richard III at Bosworth in 1485 and becoming King Henry VII, ending the Wars of the Roses.|"[""1.

During the Tudor period from 1485 to 1603, England and Wales were ruled by the Tudors, including Henry VII, Henry VIII, and Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth. The Tudors unified the people, making them law-abiding, patriotic, and prosperous. Wales welcomed Henry as a Welsh ruler. Under the Tudors, the law became strong, protecting the weak and punishing the mighty. The Act of Union in 1535 united Wales and England on equal terms, granting Wales representation in Parliament. Shires were established in Wales, ensuring equal political rights and ending discriminatory laws. The Court of Wales in Ludlow, led by figures like Bishop Lee, ensured justice for all, making the country well-governed and safe for its people.|"['1.

During the peaceful reign of Queen Elizabeth, Sir Henry Sidney presided over the Court of Wales, a position he cherished as it allowed him to do good every day for the people. In addition to this central court, Wales had separate Great Sessions held in different regions due to the distance from London. The Tudors believed in empowering the people to govern themselves, appointing squires as justices and freemen as jurors. The Reformation in England, initially a political move by Henry VIII to control both the country and the Church, led to changes like dissolving monasteries and translating the Bible. While the movement gained momentum in England and Ireland, it was met with indifference and reluctance in Wales.|"[""1.

During the Tudor era, significant changes occurred in Wales due to the Reformation. English replaced Latin in public worship, causing confusion and resentment among the Welsh who considered their language superior. The dissolution of monasteries led to the loss of valuable resources and charitable aid for the poor. The destruction of relics and images deeply impacted the Welsh, who held strong beliefs in their powers. Despite resistance, the Reformation took hold, alienating many Welsh people from their traditional practices and beliefs. Attempts to disrupt the religious settlement by the Jesuits and John Penry were met with resistance and consequences. The Welsh faced challenges to their loyalty and faith, highlighting the complex impact of religious changes during this period.|['1.

During the reign of Elizabeth, the Welsh language gained recognition. Ruthin School, established in 1595, aimed to have a Welsh-speaking master. The Welsh Bible by William Morgan in 1588, supported by Archbishop Whitgift, marked a significant moment welcoming the Reformation. However, the Reformation's impact was not as profound in Wales as in England. The Tudors, like Elizabeth, favored the people over nobles, fostering harmony between Crown and Parliament. In contrast, the Stuarts, including James I and Charles I, faced conflict with Parliament over law and religion. The period from 1603 to 1642 saw Welsh loyalty to the king during the Civil War, where Welsh involvement was notable. The war extended to Wales, with various skirmishes and castle takeovers. Wales' strategic importance for the king, particularly as a route to Ireland, influenced the war's outcome, leading to the king's imprisonment by the army in 1647.|['1.

The Second Civil War in 1648 and 1649 was a conflict between the Parliament and the army led by Cromwell. The Parliament aimed to establish one religion, while the army advocated for freedom of worship. The army, known as the Independents, clashed with the Presbyterian ideal supported by Parliament. The war saw revolts in Kent, Pembrokeshire, and Scotland. The New Model army, under Cromwell's command, defeated Welsh generals at St Fagans and Pembroke Castle. The siege of Pembroke marked a turning point in the war. Ultimately, the Commonwealth was established after the execution of King Charles I in 1649.

During the two centuries of apparent settlement and sleep, a silent revolution took place in Wales. This period was more significant in understanding the present than the past battles of the House of Cunedda. The history of Wales shifted from focusing on princes and nobles to the people themselves. Owen Glendower's brief rule was seen as a prophecy, hinting at a change in the air. The transition from a privileged class to a self-reliant peasantry was gradual but transformative. The evolution of Welsh literature mirrored these changes, from the grandeur of the princes to the emergence of a new poetic philosophy among the people. The rise of the Welsh peasant was marked by writers like Rees Prichard, Williams Pant y Celyn, and Islwyn, each representing different centuries and styles. The shift in Welsh literature reflected broader societal changes driven by factors like the long-bow, gunpowder, ideas of equality, industry, and commerce.|"['1.

Travel through Wales and witness the contrast between the old and the new. The ancient ruins of castles and monasteries stand alongside modern quarries, towns, ports, and educational institutions. Religion, a delicate topic intertwined with politics and history, holds significant influence in Wales. It has been both a source of strength and a cause of political strife. Throughout history, nations experience periods of religious tranquility and fervor, each shaping the country's character differently. The Calvinistic belief in predestination dominates energetic eras, while Arminian beliefs prevail in times of calm. The Church's role evolves, either maintaining the spirit of religion during peace or adapting to new fervor when free. The eighteenth century saw religious indifference, while the nineteenth century sparked enthusiasm. Howel Harris, a passionate figure, led a religious revival, challenging the apathy of the Church and inspiring a spiritual awakening. Religious diversity and historical context shape modern Welsh society, emphasizing the importance of understanding and tolerance in interpreting the nation's complex religious landscape.|"['1.

Howel Harris's voice sparked a new life that influenced various aspects of Welsh society. The revival led to a century of powerful sermons and enriched literature, particularly hymns. It spurred education, with Griffith Jones and Charles of Bala establishing innovative teaching methods. The Revival also inspired demands for political representation, challenging the power held by the squires. The Reform Acts of 1832 and 1867 expanded voting rights, reflecting the changing industrial landscape of Wales. Coal and iron industries flourished, transforming towns like Cardiff and Newport. Despite initial disappointments, political struggles between the old gentry and emerging classes reshaped Welsh governance. The Ballot Act of 1870 and rural-to-urban migrations further impacted the evolving political landscape.|"[""1.

In 1885, the third Reform Act marked a significant shift in the political landscape, particularly in Wales. The Act disenfranchised rural districts like Brecon, Cardigan, Pembroke, and Anglesey while granting additional representation to industrial areas like Carnarvonshire, Swansea, Carmarthenshire, Monmouthshire, and Glamorgan. This change empowered agricultural laborers and artisans, altering the traditional power dynamics. Wales evolved from blindly following the gentry to becoming the most democratic part of Britain. The Sunday School system, established before 1814, played a vital role in educating the masses, with dedicated teachers and a rigorous curriculum. Literary Meetings and the Eisteddvod further enriched Welsh culture and education, fostering a deep sense of community and pride. The evolution of education, from Griffith Jones' circulating schools to modern compulsory and free education, highlights Wales' commitment to knowledge and progress.|['1.

The history of secondary education in Wales dates back to the dissolution of monasteries. Endowed schools, like the Friars at Bangor, and proprietary schools served this purpose. The Education Act of 1889 established a system of secondary schools under popular control. Notable schools include Brecon and Llandovery. These schools were initially founded for religious ministry and were later expanded to include colleges in various districts. Higher education in Wales had been a long-standing dream, with attempts dating back to Owen Glendower. The University College of Wales in Aberystwyth opened in 1872, followed by colleges in Cardiff and Bangor. The University of Wales was formed in 1893. The educational system in Wales aims for greater unity, with efforts to integrate secondary schools and colleges under one efficient and patriotic University.|['1.

The Local Government Acts that followed the Reform Acts were more crucial to Wales. When the Reform Act of 1884 granted agricultural laborers the right to vote, all interests were represented in Parliament. Further expanding the franchise wouldn't change party dynamics, as thought by the British Parliament, too busy to consider sentiment. The complexity of interests made it hard to address them effectively. This led to a shift towards local government expansion. Wales lacked local governance and needed it the most. The County Council Act of 1888 and the Local Government Act of 1894 were pivotal. Welsh local councils were warmly embraced, filling a void. Trained men from various institutions became councillors, bringing skill and tact to governance. The councils faced challenges but made significant strides in education and welfare. Today, Wales stands united and self-reliant, with local councils playing a vital role in its progress.|['1.

The Welsh people have achieved unity despite challenges like the absence of a central capital city. The south and north regions differ in population density and industrial versus agricultural focus. The southern counties are more industrialized, while the central ones are more rural. The northern counties have a denser industrial population. Unity has also overcome religious differences through humor and hymns. The bilingual difficulty has been resolved by teaching both English and Welsh in schools. Wales is characterized by its democratic spirit, thoughtful peasantry, and lack of a traditional middle class. The upper class is small and often overlooked, with a strong sense of community among all social classes.|['1.

In recent years, Wales has seen significant changes due to three major factors: religion, industry, and education. Education plays a crucial role in promoting equality and leveling the playing field. Welsh children from both urban and rural areas attend the same schools, from elementary to secondary, and even proceed to the same university. This equal access to education helps bridge social gaps. Unlike in England, in Wales, all dialects, along with the literary language, are respected without any stigma attached. Wales, similar to Scotland, takes pride in its future aspirations rather than just past achievements. The country's small size fosters a sense of unity and healthy competition among its towns and colleges, each striving to contribute positively to Wales through industries, schools, or the press. This spirit of unity and ambition drives Wales towards continuous progress in various fields like industry, education, literature, and politics.|['1.
