Bobby carefully made his way along the slippery roof towards the window where Meg was waiting. The snow made it hard to walk, caking his shoes and almost blinding him.

His siblings included the twins, Dot and Twaddles, who were four years old. The family also had pets like Philip the dog and Annabel Lee the cat, along with Twaddles' beloved rabbits.

Bobby had a stroke of luck when he fell into a dense bush near the porch, avoiding a serious injury. The bush, overgrown and tough, made it challenging to free him. With Norah and Meg's help, they struggled to dislodge him gently. Mother Blossom, unfazed by the chaos, calmly guided the rescue mission. Eventually, Bobby was safely extracted. Inside, the family welcomed a visitor from the hardware store, causing excitement among the children. Mother Blossom redirected their focus to preparing for supper and warned against looking unkempt for their father's return. The children eagerly anticipated playing in the snow the next day.

The next morning, the snow had stopped falling, but there was plenty for sledding. After breakfast, the four Blossom siblings, bundled up warmly, headed out with their sleds. Twaddles tried to get Meg's attention, but he tumbled into a snowdrift. By Sunday, more snow fell, and the wind picked up, hinting at a blizzard. However, by Monday, the snow had stopped, although the sun remained hidden. The children brought their lunch, and Meg and Bobby had theirs too. Their teacher, Miss Mason, read them stories about the Arctic, and their geography lesson was on the polar bear's habitat.

Dot and Twaddles enjoyed sliding down the snow-covered hill together, holding hands for support. The slide was a bit bumpy but thrilling, especially the exciting finish where they landed on the icy pond. Soon, other children joined in on the fun, even those without skates. Dot loved the adventurous tumble at the end, while Meg and Bobby kept a watchful eye on them. Twaddles, unable to skate, borrowed a sled from Marion and decided to try tobogganing. Despite warnings from Bobby, Twaddles zoomed down the slide, crashed into a skater, and ended up skimming over thin ice. Luckily, a kind stranger rescued him and brought him safely back to shore. After a cold and wet mishap, Twaddles was quickly dried off and taken home by his mother.

Twaddles hesitated before devouring the tempting jar of jelly-like substance. He had already caused enough trouble by spilling glue in the kitchen, leading to a ban on dessert. Meanwhile, Bobby shared a story about the Jordans' financial struggles, sparking a discussion about helping them. Father Blossom advised against shoveling snow for money due to the kids' age, suggesting a fair instead. Mother Blossom proposed organizing committees and tables to collect items for sale. She explained how they could ask for cake donations, handmade items, and contributions from local businesses. The money raised could then directly assist the Jordans.

Bobby contemplated the idea of organizing a fair to raise money, discussing it with his friends at school. The next morning, Mother Blossom suggested having three tables at the fair and adding a play as an extra attraction. Mrs. Jordan, an elderly woman with a disabled son, had fallen on hard times. Miss Mason, her employer, had offered to place her son in a home, but Mrs. Jordan refused, leading to financial struggles. Bobby and his friends decided to proceed with the fair, gathering items to sell. Despite some boys backing out, they persevered, understanding they were doing it for the Jordans.

Aunt Polly and the twins left the room, and soon a cute little bear returned, wobbling on four legs, opening a red flannel mouth to yawn.

The tall snowbanks flanked the creek, leading Meg and Bobby to the twin oaks, where they needed to turn towards Mrs. Anson's home. Struggling to climb, they removed their skates and ascended. In a snow-covered field, they spotted rabbit tracks and distant chicken-yard fence posts. Mrs. Anson, pleased to see them, mentioned thinking of Meg's mother earlier. She offered eggs, knowing they likely needed some. Mrs. Anson, content in her solitude with cats and chickens, was well-versed in weather. Meg and Bobby, familiar with the road, oddly lost track of it. They managed to uncover a signpost, and as they retraced their steps, a frightened rabbit dashed across. Despite the darkening sky, they found their way home, guided by their loyal dog, Philip. Hungry and snow-covered, they arrived just in time for supper, sharing stories of their snowy adventure.|['1.
