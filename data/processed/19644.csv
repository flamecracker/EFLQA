"""Mary's Meadow"" was a story loved by many readers. It was the last serial tale written by Mrs. Ewing, inspired by her settling in Taunton in 1883. The story sparked a movement where children adopted ""Mary-meadowing"" to beautify their surroundings. Mrs. Ewing received inquiries about the plants in her story, leading to the formation of the ""Parkinson Society"" to preserve old garden flowers. The society exchanged seeds, planted flowers in waste places, and aimed to prevent rare flower extinction. Reports on plant exchanges were shared until Mrs. Ewing's passing. Her interest in gardening led to the publication of ""Letters from a Little Garden."" The title of John Parkinson's book, _Paradisi in sole Paradisus terrestris_, was a play on words meaning ""Park--in--son's Earthly Paradise."" The story also touched on themes of selfishness and the importance of loving your neighbor."|"['1.

The Old Squire, though not his real name, is a wealthy man who owns vast fields next to our place. Father's fields lie beyond Mary's Meadow, and the Old Squire once tried to buy them, but Father refused. They argued about a right of way through the meadow, leading to a legal dispute and an appeal. The Old Squire, accompanied by his dog Saxon, patrolled the area to prevent us from trespassing. Despite his fierce appearance, Saxon is a friendly dog who enjoys Bath Oliver Biscuits. The Weeding Woman, our nursery-maid's aunt, shares stories about the Old Squire's frugality and peculiar habits with Bessy. Chris, our youngest brother, loves to reenact these tales, smashing items while mimicking the Old Squire's actions, much to our amusement.|"[""1.

The Gossiping Gardener talks endlessly, mainly about the Old Squire. She criticizes how his flowers and fruits go to waste because he doesn't share them, except with Lady Catherine, who never appreciates his gifts. Adela asks why he's so kind to Lady Catherine, and Father explains it's because people in the area admire nobility. The narrator enjoys the lords and ladies in the hedges of Mary's Meadow, comparing their beauty in different seasons. The family's peaceful life is disrupted by a lawsuit between Father and the Old Squire. Mother warns them to stay away from Mary's Meadow, fearing the Old Squire's dog, Saxon. Despite the tensions, the family finds solace in fairy tales and the nightingale's song in the meadow.|"[""1.

Father sometimes comes home in a bad mood, and we have to be very quiet when he is cross. One day, Chris made Lady Catherine happy by saying that we were playing about the house when Father was upset. Chris and the others were playing with corks and pretending to be on the West Coast of Africa. They even blacked their faces with burnt cork. When Father unexpectedly came home early and in a bad mood, Chris, with his face all smudged, ran into the front hall playing a drum. Later, when Lady Catherine asked why Chris wasn't at dessert, he said it was because Father was cross. Although Chris sometimes says odd things due to a childhood accident, he means well. Despite his quirks, Lady Catherine adores him. Mother was persuaded to leave with Aunt Catherine to the South of France to avoid stress, especially after Chris fell ill.|"['1.

Mother instructed me to take on the role of a Little Mother to my siblings while she was away, emphasizing the importance of pleasing Father and being selfless. I made a promise to fulfill her expectations. We all felt Christopher's absence deeply, even Saxon, our loyal dog. We welcomed Saxon as our new brother in Christopher's absence, and he joyfully joined our family gatherings. Despite restrictions, Father allowed us to play in Mary's Meadow, a place we cherished. Disappointed with recent books, Arthur decided to read only grown-up or adventure books. A Japanese-themed book captured Arthur's interest, reminiscent of Uncle Charley's visit and his enchanting Japanese tales. A stork illustration in the book delighted Arthur, but he critiqued its inaccuracies, labeling it a disappointment.|"[""1.

Christopher was very disappointed. His mother gave him a book filled with lovely pictures, especially of animals. She chose it because it had a wonderful picture of a toad, knowing how much Chris adored toads. For months, he had befriended one in the garden, talking to it as it crawled away, even letting it stand on its hind legs for him to rub its back. The toad in the book looked just like his garden friend. Excited, he asked his brother Arthur to read him the story about the toad, but Arthur was busy with his water-wheel project. After some coaxing, Arthur agreed to read the story but found it to be about a silly girl and a frog, not a toad. To cheer up Chris, Arthur suggested turning the book into a painting book by pasting pictures over the stories, making it a fun project for them to do together. Arthur's kindness made Chris smile, despite his initial disappointment.|"[""1.

In the valley below Mary's Meadow, the Ladybrook flows, turning the water-wheel of Mary's Mill. The picturesque old mill, sketched beautifully by Mother, once caused her to catch a cold. One delightful day, during a picnic on the punt, Arthur decided his next mill would be a water-mill. Eager to help, I rushed to find a book in the library, but mistakenly brought a Gardener's Dictionary instead of a Miller's Dictionary about mills. Despite the mix-up, the gardening book sparked our interest and led Arthur to consider building a cold frame for flowers. Intrigued by the old book's charm, Arthur appreciated the privilege of exploring the library. The encounter with the unusual book ended up inspiring us about gardening and flowers, making it a delightful and unexpected adventure.|"[""1.

"The Latin name for this book is ""Paradisi in sole, Paradisus terrestris,"" which we don't quite grasp, even though we're learning Latin. So, we refer to it as the Book of Paradise. In English, it's called ""Or a Garden of all sorts of pleasant flowers which our English air will permit to be nursed up."" Each page is titled ""The Garden of Pleasant Flowers,"" and it's attributed to John Parkinson, Apothecary of London, and the King's Herbarist, from 1629. The dedication to the Queen mentions her love for flowers and how this book can be a guide when her own garden isn't blooming. It's fascinating to think about the Queen tending to her garden, especially with flowers like Daffodils and Cowslips, including the unique Hose-in-Hose variety.

"I enjoyed being a Little Mother to the others, putting them first and myself second. We used to say, ""Others first, Little Mothers afterwards."" One day, I created a story for them inspired by the Book of Paradise. The idea captivated us all. The story never had a clear plot, but the characters like the Queen of the Blue Robe, the Dwarf, the Honest Root-gatherer, and the King's Apothecary became popular among us. I suggested turning our gardens into an Earthly Paradise with roles like the King's Apothecary, the Honest Root-gatherer, the Weeding Woman, and a Queen in a blue dress. The idea was met with enthusiasm until Father intervened. Despite the interruption, we continued planning, with Arthur proposing herbal remedies and Adela wanting to be the Weeding Woman.

I told Arthur his idea was great, and I didn't want to be Queen. I thought I could create a new role for myself later. If they left me alone, I'd think while making Adela's bonnet. I read from the Book of Paradise and looked at flowers in the index. The Queen had many types of cowslips. I only knew the Common Cowslip. Bessy's aunt had a double cowslip. I laughed at the thought of telling her cowslips are Queen's flowers. Mother's letter mentioned Father's note praising me for keeping the children entertained. She sent me a book called _A Tour Round my Garden_. I loved the stories in it, especially the one about the vine extending in long porticoes.

At the base of a single tree, rather than the small bindweed with its white blossom, one might discover the elegantly climbing convolvulus major, showcasing a variety of enchanting hues. I derive immense joy from selecting a wild rose from a hedge and grafting onto it red and white cultivated roses, including magnificent golden yellow single roses, large Provence roses, and others with red and white variegation. The streams nearby lack the forget-me-nots with their blue blooms that adorn the stream in my garden. I plan to save the seeds and scatter them along my paths, anticipating the delight and surprise of passersby encountering these beautiful flowers and fruits during their walks. This fancy of mine could potentially influence a future botanist exploring these areas, resulting in a unique system.

In the kitchen garden, there are beautiful flowers lining the path next to the vegetables. John grew stunning poppies that summer, reminiscent of Alphonse Karr's wild poppies. The poppies varied in size and color, from red to pink to white. John generously shared their seeds, which were easy to collect. Harry even transplanted some seedlings to our Paradise. The Scotch Gardener kindly gave us advice on improving our gardens by renewing the soil. Father's farming man was always helpful, providing warm milk and even cutting fuel for our games. Arthur and Harry were excited to learn about making compost for the soil. They appreciated Michael's kindness and generosity, contrasting with John's stricter demeanor.|"['1.

When digging up squares of grass from a field like the paddock, you discover the new earth just underneath. John turfed a new piece by the pond, but wouldn't spare a flower-pot full for anyone. Arthur questioned if they ever swept their walks, recalling the German women with threepenny brooms. Harry, seen very dirty after digging up turfs, was afraid of John finding out. He worked hard since six o'clock, fearing John's disapproval. Leaf mould takes time to form, and Arthur was impatient, wanting to shake the trees for more leaves. Mother was surprised by Arthur's gardening interest but supported their library visits. Chris enjoyed being the Dwarf in their game, asking for a real Dwarf Daffodil for his garden.

Chris was feeling discontented because his friends Arthur and Harry had two names each, while he only had one. Arthur was known as a Pothecary (Chris insisted on saying it as two words) and John Parkinson, while Harry was Honest Root-gatherer and Francis le Vean. Adela had only one name, Weeding Woman, just like Chris, who was called Traveller's Joy. Chris longed for a double name like his friends. To cheer him up, his friend told him about different varieties of Cowslips, including the Franticke or Foolish Cowslip. Later, Chris was teased for wearing four stockings, with two pairs on each leg. Despite the mix-up, Chris found joy in the prospect of planting double cowslips in the garden. The Weeding Woman, who was like an aunt to Bessy, had a deep love for flowers and cared for them like her own children. Despite her age and physical limitations, she cherished her garden as if it were a precious treasure.|"[""1.

Bessy's aunt warmly welcomed her to take one of the plants, despite Bessy insisting on keeping two or three. The aunt believed in having only what was needed, as she wisely remarked that one never knows what the future holds. The meadow was described as a vibrant place teeming with various flowers like wild roses, hawthorn, and ferns. The narrator found joy in the beauty of Mary's Meadow and decided to plant some delicate flowers there.

Once, a girl faced a furious confrontation in the meadow. Accused of being a thief and a liar, she endured harsh words from the Old Squire. As her tears flowed, her loyal dog, Saxon, offered comfort.

Aunt Catherine shared a tale about her visit to the barracks, a place she initially hesitated to go due to the commotion in the nearby streets. However, she later decided to visit and noticed the beauty of wild clematis along the road. This sight made her reflect on the lack of flowers for those without gardens, especially a poor girl in the barracks. Feeling moved, Aunt Catherine instructed her gardener, Hobbs, to gather flowers for the girl. Despite the simplicity of the flowers, it was a thoughtful gesture, considering the girl's circumstances. Aunt Catherine emphasized the importance of returning borrowed items, like baskets, sharing her meticulous care for them.

I was upset by the incident in Mary's Meadow and sought refuge in my room, shedding tears to avoid explaining the painful memory. The field held cherished memories for us, where we played and discovered fairy realms. However, a dispute between the Old Squire and my father led to our banishment from the meadow.

Undoubtedly, there were numerous renovations. Deserted bedding quickly decays, but uprooted clumps of herbaceous plants endure in shady spots, sometimes blooming pathetically where discarded. Once, I encountered a splendid Queen Anne estate, authentically old, not a modern replica. Crafted by Chippendale, the furniture within bore the mark of his labor. Whether the chairs and tables appealed aesthetically is subjective, yet they were skillfully crafted and aged, much like the herbaceous plants, resilient. The subsequent generation deemed them unsightly. New furnishings replaced the Chippendale pieces, banishing them to servant quarters and farmhouses. Undoubtedly, many were lost. Fashion whims extend to all classes, with the lower classes often wasteful. Elizabethan bedsteads have been found under hay piles, and much old oak has fueled cottage fires. A village girl explained that people grow tired of old armchairs, opting for new ones for festivities. Some Chippendale pieces may have met the same fate, but most withstood neglect like hardy perennials. When Queen Anne architecture and Chippendale furniture regained popularity, there was a frenzy to reclaim and restore these pieces from attics to cellars, from farmhouses to cottages.

In a Little Garden, Joan tends to the roses and seedlings while Darby could focus on maintaining the walks and grassplots. Well-kept turf adds charm to a garden, with green grass being a highlight in the British Isles. It's essential to use high-quality seed when planting grass to avoid a mix of weeds. Turfs can create a lawn faster than seeds, but they should be laid close together like a puzzle and rolled well. Grassplots should ideally consist of grass and a bit of white clover, avoiding weeds like soldiers and dog-daisies. To remove weeds, diligent digging by the roots is the most effective method. Salt can also be used carefully to treat weeds, ensuring the grass grows back healthy and weed-free.|['1.

To have a lush lawn, it's essential to mow the grass frequently and keep it moist. Use a scythe on wet grass and a machine on dry grass. During winter, sweep and roll the lawn, removing any debris like stones or sticks. If the grass is coarse, sand can help, and for weak grass, try soot, guano, or wood ashes before rain. Chamomile and thyme can add charm to the lawn. Stones make great borders, especially with plants like pink catch-fly or low-growing pinks. Slugs can be a nuisance, but turnip slices and bran can help deter them. Overall, maintaining a lawn involves a balance of care and creativity, with stones and diverse plants adding character and functionality.|['1.

I enjoy warm colors on my garden paths. If I could, I would always have red paths. There is a red material that we used to find in Yorkshire from burning processes that I found pretty. Good paths are a great luxury. After rain, check for puddles on your paths and fill them up. Keep the drains clear. Some suggest breaking up the paths occasionally, while others advise against it. Salt can help with weeds and moss, but some say it feeds them in the long run. I believe weeding with an old knife and a little salt is best. Remember to plant bulbs by Lord Mayor's Day. Plant roses carefully in good soil. Winter is a time to plan and write in your garden book for the upcoming seasons. Experience is the best teacher in gardening.|['1.

Hardy flowers in hedges and ditches are nourished by fallen leaves and refuse, protecting them from harsh weather. Flowers in gardens are tidied, making them hungry and exposed. Adding a top-dressing and mulching, especially in autumn, benefits them. You don't need to upturn a flower border each year. Thinning clumps, weeding, and relocating plants can suffice. Concentrated strength leads to larger blooms. Carefully support tall plants, keep all plants comfortable, and prune fading flowers to redirect strength into remaining blossoms. Grow what suits your soil and climate best. Some flowers are picky about air quality. Sturdy flowers like poppies, chrysanthemums, and iris thrive even in polluted areas. North-facing borders are safest in winter. Protect delicate plants with sand, cinders, and bracken. Experiment with less hardy plants in milder regions. Protect plants from frost with hot bottles or lamps. Caring for tender plants in a small garden is manageable with some effort.|['1.

In dry conditions, it's better to give your plants a good soak with tepid water rather than just sprinkling them. Watering can be tiring but hiring help for this task can be cost-effective. Some gardeners believe in the principle that once you start watering, you must continue, but this is not always necessary. An occasional thorough soaking can be more beneficial than frequent light sprinklings. During hot weather, don't hesitate to water your polyanthuses and primroses to prevent them from suffering due to drought. Plants, like humans, can adapt to certain conditions and may struggle if suddenly exposed to different environments. When moving plants, consider the habits and needs of the specific plant to ensure successful transplantation. Protect the roots of plants from exposure to drying winds, and when moving plants, ensure their roots are well protected and watered. Some gardeners seem to have a special touch when it comes to caring for plants, showing that a bit of luck or skill can go a long way in gardening.|['1.

"A dear friend, known for his green thumb, visited my garden this fall. Despite his worldwide travels, he only tends to window-boxes in London. He bestowed the name ""Desolation Border"" upon a neglected area in my garden, promising to sow flowers. Despite my doubts, his seeds bloomed beautifully. Even after his departure, surprises arrived by post—plants thriving in unlikely places. This unexpected growth, like a magical transformation, puzzles and delights me.

In February, the owner of a Little Garden experiences a mix of emotions. After tending to the garden throughout the seasons, from the summer bloom to the autumn trimmings, seeing the first shoots of favorite paeonies or the revival of old hepaticas brings joy. Despite the risk of catching a cold from the frosty borders, the sight of crocuses under the sun feels like a glimpse of summer. While some may wear red-flannel knickerbockers for warmth like in Canada, others can opt for fleece cork socks and yellow-leather leggings for comfort. Delicate gardeners must take precautions during the uncertain spring and autumn seasons. It's essential to protect both the fragile gardeners and the vulnerable plants by ensuring they are firmly planted and shielded from frost. As the weather warms, thoughts of seedlings and cuttings can inspire gardeners to start preparing for the planting season indoors, creating clumps of plants ready for the garden.|['1.

"For the few pots and pans and boxes of cuttings and seedlings you need, it's worth getting good compost from a nursery gardener. Always bury your pot in a second covering, like sand or larger pots. A cover to prevent evaporation is crucial. When we were young and sick, Dr. Brown cheered us up with stories. He told us about Solomon who lived on a hill, making us laugh. He once said some people love things when they lack love. Margery thinks it was ""temperaments,"" not ""tempers."" We found it in the dictionary. We couldn't understand ""temperamental,"" but it was signed by someone named Brown. We couldn't ask Dr. Brown about it as it might be rude. Margery had a spot on her nail, and she went on a journey.

There are only two of us left in our family. Our parents and our brother all passed away from fever almost five years ago. We believe we will see them again in Paradise. This is why we strive to be good and avoid being naughty, to ensure we reunite with them. I have faint memories of them - sitting on my father's shoulders, feeling safe with my mother, and my brother Robin playing with my toys. My sister Margery, who is three years older, recalls more vividly. She remembers the funeral, the books moved to the attic, and a disagreement between Grandmamma and Dr. Brown. Margery often recounts a conversation between Grandmamma and Dr. Brown, where Dr. Brown spoke critically about their profession, causing tension in the room.

Sunflowers are like dolls to play with, but Margery and I prefer them in some ways. You can't move them around like dolls, but they stand on their own. You can name them, teach them, and watch them grow and change, unlike dolls. We play a game on Sundays in the garden, naming the Sunflowers after saints and reading about them from an old book. They look like grown-up people with their height and yellow glow. On weekdays, I pretend they are women turned into flowers. Sometimes, when it's dark and they stare at me, I get scared they might be turning into something else.

That morning, I woke up feeling unwell and late. Grandmamma noticed my headache and compared me to a pale handkerchief. She suggested rhubarb and magnesia, but we were out of rhubarb, so Jael went to get some. I didn't like the medicine, but I was relieved to have a break from Jael. My thick hair often causes me headaches, according to Grandmamma. Dr. Brown came and advised rest, warmth, and a simple meal. After his visit, I felt better and fell asleep. When I woke, there was bread-and-milk waiting for me. Despite some mishaps with Jael, the hot bottle and medicine helped me relax.

I pondered if the Sunflowers would awaken with candles like I did. Would they stir if Jael flashed the Rushlight at them? Does the moon rouse them? Are they awake like me or sleeping? Do they resemble the Fairy Book image with leaves covering their faces? I contemplated waking St. George with a candle. The clock chimed, urging me to act. Overcoming fear, I ventured out. The Sunflowers looked different under the moon. They seemed alive but not startled by the light. Their leaves resembled the flower-women in the picture.

Grace was concerned about the unpleasant smells in the backyard causing her sore throat. She thought sunflowers might help with the smell and suggested it to Jael. However, Jael dismissed the idea, saying sunflowers were only good for feeding fowls. Despite this, Grace kissed the flowers for their sweet scent and decided to visit Dr. Brown about her throat and the smells.

Once there was a hermit who tended a garden with great care. As he grew old and his sight faded, a young boy joined him. The boy worked hard, learning the names and properties of the plants.

Long ago in a monastery, Brother Benedict tended a special garden filled with rare and curious plants. Over time, his pride grew with the garden's beauty. Troubled by his attachment to earthly things, he sought advice from a wise hermit. The hermit shared wisdom about living for others and not oneself.
