"As a young boy, I embarked on thrilling adventures that I now share in this book, dedicated especially to boys. I hope it brings you joy, knowledge, and amusement. But if you prefer melancholy to fun, then this book may not be for you. My love for exploration has been a constant in my life, from childhood to adulthood.

At first, convincing my parents to let me go on the adventure was tough, but I argued that my father wouldn't have become a great captain if he hadn't taken risks. Eventually, my father agreed. My mother, seeing his decision, stopped objecting and bid me farewell with a request to return soon due to their aging. With my father's approval, I set sail with an old friend of his, a merchant captain heading to the South Seas on the Arrow. My mother gave me a Bible and urged me to read a chapter daily and say my prayers. As the ship sailed, the sailors' cheerful songs filled the air, and I watched as we left the shore behind. The journey was filled with new experiences, like flying fish and rough weather near Cape Horn. Finally, we reached the Coral Islands of the Pacific, a sight that filled me with wonder and joy.|"[""1.

One night, as we sailed through the tropics, a fierce storm hit our ship. The wind destroyed two of our masts, leaving only the foremast standing. We couldn't raise any sail on it. For five days, the storm raged, sweeping everything off the decks except a small boat. The steersman was tied to the wheel to avoid being washed away. Lost at sea, we feared the treacherous coral reefs of the Pacific. On the sixth morning, we spotted an island surrounded by a coral reef. Jack Martin proposed a risky plan to reach the shore, as our ship was about to crash. We clung to an oar as the ship hit the reef and we were thrown into the tumultuous sea.

Recovering from unconsciousness brings a peculiar sensation - a dreamy, confused state with weariness. Slowly waking, I heard Peterkin's voice asking if I felt better. I thought I overslept, fearing punishment for laziness. But the feeling faded, replaced by a sense of illness. A gentle breeze reminded me of home, but the sea's roar brought me back. Opening my eyes, I met Jack's worried gaze. He urged me to rest, offering cool water. Peterkin, relieved, teased me for my stiff, silent state. Jack explained how they reached the shore after the ship struck, the boat's crew trying to row back but failing due to the wind. Jack remains hopeful, knowing the vast South Sea Islands offer a chance for rescue. The ship sank after the crew's valiant effort to reach it.|"['1.

We were dressed in sturdy canvas trousers and thick sailors' shoes. Jack wore a red flannel shirt, a blue jacket, a red night-cap, and socks with Lord Nelson's portraits. Peterkin had on a striped shirt belted like a tunic, a black hat, and no jacket. I wore a blue shirt, jacket, cap, and socks. Grateful to have survived the shipwreck, we decided to explore the island. The scenery was breathtaking with hills, colorful trees, and a sandy beach. The sea was calm near the shore due to a coral reef. The beauty of nature made us reflect on the Creator. Peterkin's excitement led us to a surprising discovery on the beach.

As we approached, we saw Peterkin struggling to free the axe from the oar. Jack had lodged it there while attempting to cut tangled cordage at the ship's bow. Luckily, the axe remained stuck. Jack managed to extract it, praising its value over knives. Peterkin noted iron on the blade, used to reinforce it. Jack carefully removed the nails, blunting the axe in the process. They decided to burn the wood off at a later time. Jack suggested checking the shipwreck area for more items. They agreed, trusting Jack's leadership. While walking along the beach, Peterkin realized they had no food, except wild berries. Jack assured they were safe to eat. Jack spotted coconut palms with nuts, and Peterkin swiftly climbed to fetch some. Peterkin expressed thirst, longing for a spring.

"""I'm not up to everything, Peterkin,"" replied Jack, ""but I have read many books of travel and adventure in my life. That has taught me things you might not know."" Peterkin disagreed, saying book knowledge doesn't always translate to practical skills. Jack defended books, saying they provide valuable information. To prove a point, Jack asked Peterkin to climb a tree and pick a green coconut. Peterkin, surprised by the taste, called it nectar. Jack explained he read about it, showing the value of books.

Peterkin quickly put on the oversized boots, trousers, and vest, but they were too big even for him. I tried them on too, and although they fit my legs, they were too large for my feet. We passed them to Jack, who gladly accepted them as they suited him perfectly. Jack didn't use them much as they were heavy. As night fell, we postponed our hill climb for the next day. We built a shelter using boughs and leaves to sleep comfortably. We gathered flints for a fire, but they didn't work. Peterkin then realized the spyglass could be a burning glass. Jack used a bow to ignite tinder, and soon we were enjoying a warm fire, sipping lemonade by the light of the flames. The next morning, we woke to the beauty of nature, basking in the tropical sun and exploring the wonders of the ocean.|['1.

While contemplating, I remembered my Bible, a promise to my mother. Sadly, it remained on the ship. Troubled, I consoled myself by keeping my vow to pray. Quietly rising not to disturb my companions, I stepped aside for this ritual. Returning, finding them asleep, I pondered our predicament. Suddenly, a small parrot caught my eye. Perched above Peterkin, its vibrant plumage fascinated me. The bird comically peered into Peterkin's open mouth. Amused, I imagined the bird falling in, eliciting laughter. Startled, the parrot screeched, awakening Peterkin. Delighted, he reveled in our surroundings, eventually plunging into the sea. Jack, an adept swimmer, joined him. Inspired, I shed my clothes to follow but stumbled comically, much to Peterkin's amusement. After a few mishaps, I successfully joined Jack and Peterkin in the water, reveling in the underwater wonders of the coral garden.|"['1. What did the narrator remember while contemplating?\nA.

Jack and Ralph decided to take a second dive together, exploring the warm waters that allowed them to stay submerged for longer than usual. Jack, excited by the underwater world, gathered coral and oysters while Ralph followed suit. Jack even attempted to catch a colorful fish but failed, leading to a quick return to the surface, gasping for air. As they swam back to shore, they found Peterkin and shared their oysters, planning their day ahead. After a hearty breakfast, they stored their belongings in a cave and armed themselves with clubs for an adventure into the island's interior. Their goal was to reach the mountaintop for a better view, prepared for any challenges that may come their way.|"['1.

After preparing ourselves and putting out the fire, we ventured out along the shore until we reached a valley entrance with a flowing stream. The view upon entering the valley was stunning, with gentle rises on each side covered in lush trees and shrubs. The ridges on either side extended inland and met a small mountain ahead. We decided to climb the mountain, with Jack leading, Peterkin ready to defend, and I foolishly leaving my club behind. The undergrowth was rich, and we saw various plants and birds. As we neared the hill, a loud rumbling startled us. A rock came crashing down, narrowly missing us. Peterkin, relieved, joked about mistaking it for wild beasts. We discovered it was due to stones falling from a nearby precipice.|['1.

After arriving at the foot of the hill, we prepared to climb it. Jack made an exciting discovery - a stunning bread-fruit tree. He explained its value to us: it bears fruit resembling bread, provides gum for canoes, bark for cloth, and wood for homes. Despite Peterkin's jests, Jack's knowledge impressed us. The tree's lush green leaves and colorful fruit amazed us. We then ascended to the summit, where we beheld a breathtaking view of trees and valleys. As we journeyed, we found the stump of a felled tree, hinting at past human presence on the island. Our adventure was filled with wonder and the thrill of exploration.|"['1.

We were puzzled by the discovery of a large tree stump on the mountaintop, unlike what the crew of a ship would cut. Jack speculated that savages might have cut it for a mysterious purpose. While clearing moss from the stump, Jack found three marks resembling initials but weathered beyond recognition. Perplexed, we left for the island's summit, revealing a breathtaking view of our surroundings. The island had two mountains, a lush valley, and a beach encircled by a coral reef. The calm lagoon contrasted the roaring surf outside the reef. We noted small islets marking the reef openings and other uninhabited islands in the distance. The island's beauty left us in awe, pondering the mysterious marks on the tree stump as we explored our newfound kingdom.|"['1.

From our vantage point on the mountain, we observed many things before deciding to head back. We found signs of human presence like a pole and some squared wood, indicating past inhabitants. Despite their decay, these remnants stirred our curiosity. On our return journey, we stumbled upon tracks left by an unknown animal, heightening our hopes of finding food. Excited by our discoveries, we returned to our camp. In the following days, we stayed close, contemplating our future and making our shelter cozier. Uncertainties about settling permanently and the possibility of natives or a passing ship delayed our plans. We experimented with cooking coconut and tried fishing with makeshift tools. Jack fashioned a knife from hoop-iron, and Peterkin used a freed whip-cord as a fishing line. The desire for more substantial catches led to a new fishing strategy, prompting an adventurous plan to venture into deeper waters for a better catch.|"['Question 1: What did the group find on the mountain that stirred their curiosity?\nA) Tracks left by an unknown animal\nB) Signs of human presence like a pole and squared wood\nC) Food left behind by previous inhabitants\nD) A campsite with a cozy shelter\nE) A fishing line made of hoop-iron', ""Question 2: What heightened the group's hopes of finding food on their return journey?\nA) Finding a cozy shelter\nB) Experimenting with cooking coconut\nC) Stumbling upon unknown animal tracks\nD) Making a fishing line from freed whip-cord\nE) Contemplating their future"", ""Question 3: What delayed the group's plans of settling permanently?\nA) Uncertainties about finding food\nB) Experimenting with cooking coconut\nC) The possibility of natives or a passing ship\nD) Making a fishing line from freed whip-cord\nE) Venturing into deeper waters for a better catch"", 'Question 4: What did Jack fashion from hoop-iron?\nA) A cozy shelter\nB) A fishing line\nC) A cooking tool\nD) Tracks left by an unknown animal\nE) Signs of human presence', ""Question 5: What prompted the group's adventurous plan to venture into deeper waters?\nA) Finding a cozy shelter\nB) Uncertainties about settling permanently\nC) Experimenting with cooking coconut\nD) Making a fishing line from freed whip-cord\nE) Desire for more substantial catches"", 'Question 6: What did Peterkin use as a fishing line?\nA) Hoop-iron\nB) Squared wood\nC) A pole\nD) A freed whip-cord\nE) Tracks left by an unknown animal']"|['B) Signs of human presence like a pole and squared wood', 'C) Stumbling upon unknown animal tracks', 'C) The possibility of natives or a passing ship', 'B) A fishing line', 'E) Desire for more substantial catches', 'D) A freed whip-cord']
As he began to slice through the stem once more, about six yards from the thick end, he then fashioned three sturdy poles from the branches to roll the log down to the sea. The log, being nearly two feet thick, required these levers to move it. With the poles, we managed to slowly roll it into the water. After successfully launching our makeshift boat, we turned the levers into basic oars and attempted to embark. Balancing on the log was challenging, but we managed to stay afloat. While fishing, a large fish swallowed the bait, causing us to lose balance and fall into the water.

Now, we were about to give up all the fun we had been having, and when we thought of it, Jack and I felt very down. I could see that Peterkin was sad too, for he stopped teasing us about it. But when people face problems, they often come up with ways to solve them and find better things. Our problem made us think of finding a big pool among the rocks where the water was deep enough for diving but safe from sharks. We found a pool like that, close to our camp, called our Water Garden. It was a beautiful spot with clear water, colorful corals, and marine life. We then planned to explore the whole island to find useful things and a better place to live. Jack suggested we make weapons for protection and hunt for small animals for food. Peterkin agreed to make arrows, and Jack would make bows. It was a plan we were excited about and ready to embark on.|['1.

We used to go to bed early as we were tired from fishing, working on our shelter, exploring the Water Garden, and wandering in the forest. But now, we needed to work at night and wanted candles. Jack mentioned a nut called the candle-nut that locals use as candles. Peterkin struggled to remember important details due to his distracted mind. He shared a story of missing his ship due to a game of hockey and confusion at the harbor. He mistakenly boarded a different ship before finally leaping onto his correct vessel just in time. The captain was furious but the ship set sail, leaving Peterkin relieved yet in trouble.|['1.

"""New 'Prentice,' said the captain, 'I've got no new 'prentice. My boys are all aboard already. This is a trick, you young blackguard.

"As he spoke, he lifted his axe and left, with Peterkin following. Meanwhile, I picked up the newfound cloth scrap and began studying its design. So absorbed was I in this task that I remained seated in the same position when my friends returned. ""I knew it!"" exclaimed Peterkin, laughing heartily. ""Ralph, you're incorrigible. Look, I made a club for you too. I was certain you'd still be examining that fabric when we got back."" ""I plan to use the bow for myself,"" Jack said, shaping a piece of wood with his axe. Glancing at Peterkin, who was fitting hoop-iron to a long pole, Jack inquired about his project. ""I'm joining the Lancers,"" Peterkin replied. ""I find the club too cumbersome for my delicate muscles. I think I'll be more effective with a spear."" Chuckling, I decided to change my plans as well. ""I'll fashion a sling from this cloth,"" I declared. ""I used to enjoy slinging after reading about David and Goliath."" As we each worked silently, Peterkin interrupted, requesting a strip of Jack's handkerchief to bandage his head. Suddenly, a strange and eerie cry echoed from the distant sea, startling us. Rushing to the beach, we strained to identify the source of the chilling sound under the moonlit sky, but found no explanation."|['1.

Jack mentioned that he had heard a mysterious sound twice before, but never as loud as that night. He thought he had imagined it because it was so faint. Peterkin and Jack were not scared of ghosts. Jack believed that strange things often have simple explanations. They prepared for a journey, making weapons like spears, bows, and slings. They practiced using them, realizing they needed more practice. Jack's leadership helped them improve. They set out early the next day, well-prepared. The morning was peaceful, with quiet and pleasant sounds. The narrator felt profound happiness in the tranquility. Peterkin was also joyful but expressed it quietly. The narrator realized that true happiness comes from inner peace and stillness, which can be found through religion.|"['1.

Peterkin walked beside us as we strolled along the sandy beach of our island. When we roamed through the woods, we walked in a line, one after the other, to move easily in each other's footsteps. Jack led the way, Peterkin followed, and I brought up the rear. But on the beach, we walked side by side, Jack closest to the sea, Peterkin in the middle, allowing us all to chat. Suddenly, Peterkin spotted a peculiar sight in the distance, a white column rising from the rocks. Intrigued, we hurried over, only to be surprised by spouts of water shooting up from the rocks, drenching us. After a brief scare, we laughed at Peterkin's comical fall and quickly left the spot, eager to explore more of our island.|['1.

During our exploration of the island, we encountered a mysterious phenomenon involving spouts of water that shot up violently after large waves crashed on the shore. These water spouts puzzled us until we theorized that underground channels in the rocks forced the water up through small holes. As we continued our journey, we stumbled upon a strange pale green object in the sea that seemed to evade our attempts to spear it. Although we couldn't identify it, we found solace in the discovery of various roots and fruits in a lush valley. The island's resources amazed us, from the abundant taro and yams to the diverse birdlife. As we marveled at the beauty of the island's flora and fauna, we felt grateful for our fortunate circumstances.|"['1.

Shortly after this, we discovered a remarkable tree with a unique structure that turned out to be very helpful to us. It was a magnificent chestnut tree, although Jack didn't know its exact name. The tree was laden with fine nuts that we collected. What made this tree extraordinary was its trunk. It grew about twelve feet tall without any branches, and despite not being thick, it had several remarkable projections along its stem. These projections resembled planks attached closely to the trunk from the ground up to the branches, covered with the tree's bark. These natural buttresses supported the tree's heavy canopy. We also found numerous chestnuts of various sizes growing along the stream banks. As we made our way back to the coast to camp by the beach due to mosquitoes in the forest, we admired the colorful birds around us, including paroquets, turtledoves, and wood-pigeons. We attempted to hunt for food but only succeeded in catching a pigeon by slinging a stone at it. Later, we spotted a flock of wild ducks flying towards the coast and discovered a beautiful blue lake where they landed.|"['1.

After being advised, I threw a stone that hit a hog, causing it to run away. Simultaneously, Jack's arrow pinned a little pig to the ground. As we prepared to camp, Peterkin was missing. We heard a shriek in the distance, followed by hogs' yells. Peterkin returned hungry, leading us to a feast of pig, taro-root, yam, potato, plums, and wood-pigeon. Jack expertly cooked the pig and pigeon over the fire. The taro-root resembled a potato and tasted great. The yam was sweet, and the potato surprisingly palatable. After a luxurious supper, we slept under a coral rock ledge. The next morning, we woke up late after a heavy meal but felt strong and refreshed after a morning bathe.|"[""1.

I often wonder why people in my country don't use water more for cold baths. It may not be easy to go to the sea or rivers in winter, but a tub and a sponge work well. The freshness and vigor I felt after bathing were delightful. I recommend daily cold baths for a refreshing start. I've heard of the cold-water-cure but can't say much about it. Too much or too little of a good thing could be harmful. I believe it's better to risk too much than have too little. Daylight lessens fears, as we discovered on our journey. We saw what we thought was an army, but they were penguins. We continued our journey, eager to explore more of the island.|['1.

We observed that while most fruit trees grew in valleys or near streams with rich soil, the coconut palm thrived everywhere, even on the sandy coral reef. The tree's roots were sprayed by the sea, yet they grew as lush as those in the valleys, yielding equally refreshing fruit. On a high mountain, we found shells and coral, suggesting the island was once submerged or the sea was higher. We pondered how the island rose, with theories ranging from volcanic eruption to spontaneous elevation. Noticing the different rock types, we debated the island's geological history. Following mysterious footprints, we encountered a blind, deaf wild cat that showed extreme joy upon meeting us, hinting at past human contact.|"['1.

We decided to follow the trail further, and Peterkin carried the weak cat in his arms as it fell asleep. As we advanced, we encountered more felled trees, leading us to a stream where a rudimentary bridge once stood. Moss-covered stones scattered in the water indicated its former presence. Continuing on, we stumbled upon a small, desolate hut nestled under bread-fruit trees. The sight left us in silent awe, enveloped by a melancholic stillness. The cottage, measuring twelve by ten feet, showed signs of neglect with moss and decay covering every surface. Inside, we found only a wooden stool, an iron pot, and two skeletons - one of a man and the other of a dog. The discovery moved us deeply, prompting us to search for clues about the solitary man's identity, but all we found were remnants of clothing and an old axe, hinting at a tragic tale lost to time.|['1.

After exploring the island, we stumbled upon a lonely hut with a tree stump bearing initials nearby. We pondered the fate of a castaway who may have once lived there. Speculating on his story, we debated whether he was a shipwreck survivor or a runaway sailor. The presence of a cat and dog added to the mystery. The dog, loyal to the end, died beside its master, while the cat roamed alone. We dismantled the hut to create a grave for the unknown man and his faithful companions. Exhausted from our journey, we returned to our bower for much-needed rest, finding solace in the tranquility of the evening.

After we woke up feeling very refreshed, we were worried that we might have lost track of a day. We had been keeping count of the days since we arrived on the island to remember the Sabbath. We all agreed on how long we had slept, which eased our minds. We hurried to the Water Garden for a swim and to check on the animals in the tank. Unfortunately, most of the animals were dead, and the water was in a bad state. Peterkin pointed out that the water was too salty for the animals from the ocean. Jack suggested making the tank like a miniature Pacific Ocean by adding sea water and sea creatures. He also advised adding fresh water when needed to maintain the right salt level. Peterkin joked about needing three little men to dive in to make it perfect.|['1.

We quickly bent over the tank and were quite amused by the behavior of one of the surviving crabs. It was a small crab commonly found along the coasts of England. As we watched, its back split away from its body, revealing a soft lump that wriggled and grew. Soon, it transformed into a bunch of crab legs, and the crab emerged complete from its old shell, leaving it behind. We were astonished at this sight, especially when we noticed the new crab was larger than the old one. We learned that crabs grow by shedding their shells through this fascinating process. Inspired by this, I followed Jack's advice on tank preparation, which proved to be successful beyond my expectations. This experience made me wish to share the wonders of marine life with those living inland, so they too could witness the mysteries of the sea.|"['1.

"""It was a mysterious sight indeed!"" he exclaimed, rising from the log and preparing his enormous club. Determined to investigate further, we hurried towards the water-spout rocks. Peering over the edge, we saw the strange pale-green object still swaying in the water. ""Let me try,"" he suggested, taking the spear and aiming at the object. The spear pierced through the center, leaving the tail undisturbed. Curious and unsure, we contemplated diving down to explore. Jack, confident in his diving skills, stripped down and dove into the sea. As time passed, anxiety crept in as Jack failed to resurface. Panic set in, and we feared the worst. Peterkin's distress grew, suspecting a shark attack. Suddenly, he urged me to dive in search of Jack, hoping for a different outcome."""|"['1.

It was odd that I didn't realize it sooner. I hurried to the rocks' edge and saw something black emerging from the green shape. Jack's head popped up, shouting joyfully and tossing the spray from his hair after a dive. We were astonished to see him well after being underwater for what seemed like ten minutes, impossible for a mortal. I helped him up the rocks with awe. Peterkin, unaffected, hugged Jack and wept. Jack explained that the green shape was light from a cave. He swam towards it, saw the luminous opening, and surfaced. I dived to see the cave but found it too dark.

Jack and I decided to explore a mysterious underwater cave. We crafted a torch using bark and resin, wrapped it in coconut cloth, and set off into the dark waters. Upon entering the cave, the coral roof and pillars amazed us. The limestone formations resembled icicles, creating a magical sight. The floor rippled like water, and the walls sparkled as if studded with gems. The ceiling displayed intricate patterns, resembling cathedral fretwork. Despite our deep exploration, we couldn't reach the cave's end due to our dwindling torch. The only light seeped through the cave's mouth, reflecting off a massive white coral rock near the entrance. This adventure left us awestruck, and we had to hurriedly swim back as our torch neared its end.|['1.

After exploring the cavern, we put out the torch and left it in a dry spot, thinking we might need it if the torch got wet during future dives. As we waited for our eyes to adjust to the darkness, we marveled at the stillness and gloom around us. The thought of the magnificent dome above and the sparkling gems in the torchlight made us ponder on the wonders unseen by many. Plunging into the water, we dived through the narrow entrance and emerged panting on the rocks, greeted by our friend Peterkin. Breathing the fresh air and basking in the sunshine after our adventure in the Diamond Cave felt refreshing. We discussed the peculiar tides of the island, noting their regularity and the lack of twilight, which sometimes caught us off guard during our hunts. As we headed home, a distant grunt and squeal caught our attention, carried by the land breeze.|"['1.

"""Wait a moment, buddy. The pigs are up on the hill. Stand with Ralph by the cliff, I'll drive them through the gorge for a better shot,"" said Jack, disappearing into the bushes. Peterkin eagerly awaited, expressing his fondness for young pigs. As the herd approached, Peterkin crept up the mound, and two pigs rushed past him. One crashed into his arms, tumbling down. The other fled, but a well-aimed stone brought it down. Peterkin, unscathed, darted towards the approaching hogs. He hesitated as they passed, then suddenly lunged, spearing the old sow.

Peterkin explained that although his current shoes were not related to the pig they had just killed, the pig would play a role in making his future shoes. He had decided not to kill another pig after seeing Ralph skillfully take down the first one. Remembering his need for leather or tough material for shoes, he chose to use the tough old grandmother pig. They planned to carry the heavy pig home by tying its feet together and passing the spear handle between them. Jack and Peterkin carried the pig while Peterkin humorously remarked on their successful hunt. Jack worked tirelessly on building a boat using materials from a chestnut tree. He shaped the boat's keel and ribs using an axe and a makeshift pipe from hoop-iron to bore holes. They used iron-wood pegs and coconut husk cordage to secure the boat's structure. Despite the challenges, Jack's determination and resourcefulness led to the successful construction of the boat.|"[""1.

Planks were cut from the chestnut trees, about an inch thick, and shaped with an axe, though clumsily. Five planks on each side formed the boat, rounded like a barrel to reduce twisting. Instead of nails, we sewed the planks together using tough cordage, stitching them to the stem, stern, and keel. We added layers of coconut fiber between planks for waterproofing. The boat's interior was coated with pitch and coconut cloth, making it watertight. While Jack worked on the boat, Peterkin and I hunted ducks on mud-flats nearby. Our suppers were varied, and we often shared with our cat. Our table was a coral rock where we feasted on breadfruit, roast pig, duck, and more, washed down with coconut lemonade. Peterkin's culinary experiments were less successful, but we celebrated the boat's early completion with joy.|['1.

Jack and Peterkin were filled with laughter as they discussed their plans for the day. Jack mentioned they couldn't sail but hoped to row hard in the afternoon. If the oars weren't finished by sunset, they would use candle-nuts as lights to continue working before bed. They planned to make a sail from cocoa-nut cloth and visit their penguin friends on other islands. The thought of exploring new islands filled them with joy. After dinner, they diligently crafted oars. While working, they were surprised to hear Peterkin talking to the black cat, expressing his care and affection for it. The trio then launched their boat, rowing to the coral reef, where they marveled at the beauty of nature. The serene morning on the lagoon was a perfect backdrop for their adventures.|"['1.

Initially, we rowed aimlessly in our small boat, filled with excitement. But as our spirits settled, we pondered our next move. With four oars made but only two needed, the spare pair was kept in case of mishaps. Two rowed while the third steered. Landing on small islands yielded nothing noteworthy. On a larger one with coconut trees, we enjoyed a breakfast of nuts. Venturing to the coral reef, the grandeur of the open sea's breakers mesmerized us. The colossal waves crashed with thunderous force, captivating us. Observing the reef, we marveled at the coral's growth and the formation of islands. We contemplated the mechanics behind the creation of large coral islands, a mystery we couldn't solve. The idea of protecting our boat's keel from wear eluded us due to the lack of iron.|"['1.

Jack instructed Peterkin to gather coconut fiber to make sewing twine. Next, they would cut coconut cloth to create a sail for their boat. Jack also devised a false keel to enhance the boat's stability. With the mast, sail, and rigging set up, they launched the boat into the lagoon. They enjoyed sailing, admiring the island's view and observing the underwater life. Peterkin fished with hooks made from various materials, including ironwood, fish bones, and a brass finger ring. The brass hook proved most successful, attracting a variety of fish. They marveled at porpoises, swordfish, whales, and sharks in the lagoon. Jack recounted a tale of a swordfish attacking a ship, showing the incredible strength of these creatures.|"['1.

Sharks were rare in our waters, but we made a rule to always have someone in the boat as a lookout for any signs of danger. Whales, on the other hand, were a common sight beyond the reef, their spouts visible from afar. The first time we encountered a massive sperm whale up close was unforgettable. Its sheer size was astounding, and the force with which it dived back into the sea left us in awe. We also marveled at flying fish trying to escape dolphins, and the mystery of fish appearing in shallow pools after rain.

The massive wave crashed over the reef with a deafening roar, shaking the rocks as it rolled towards us. The water spouted violently from the reef's holes, drenching us in a spray that left us stunned and blinded. The wave surged across the lagoon, smashing onto the island's beach, toppling trees and bushes in its path. We feared our bower and boat were lost. To our relief, the bower was spared, but the boat was missing. After a frantic search, we spotted it nestled in a bush, unharmed by the wave's force. It took us two days of hard work to retrieve the boat. We then cleared the debris, restoring the area to its former state. This phenomenon occurs yearly in the Pacific, a fact shared by missionaries.

Peterkin and his friends embarked on a hunting and food-gathering adventure on the island. Despite Peterkin's mishap with a pig and a cliff, they managed to secure three hogs and ducks for their provisions. They also had a surplus of food, including breadfruits, yams, plums, and roasted pigs, although Peterkin's stuffing recipe was a disaster. The group set sail towards Penguin Island, opting for the open sea route for adventure and to enjoy the motion of the deep waters. Rowing through the lagoon and navigating the reef's surf posed challenges, but they eventually found themselves on the calm ocean swell.

"Jack exclaimed, ""Or bore a hole through a shark's tail and reeve a rope through it, eh?"" as they noticed a breeze approaching. In a flurry of activity, he directed his companions, ""Ship your oar, Peterkin. Up with the mast, Ralph; I'll see to the sail. Mind your helm; look out for squalls!"" The dark blue line on the horizon signaled an impending gust, causing the sea to froth as it swept towards them. They turned the boat's stern to face the force, riding the waves until the wind settled. As they neared Penguin Island, they marveled at the diverse penguin species with crests and different sizes. An albatross soared above, trailed by sea-gulls. Observing the penguins' soldier-like stance and unique features, they were intrigued by the birds' behavior. The penguins, some carrying eggs under their tails, displayed a fascinating colony life on the island."|"['1.

"While observing the penguins on the island, we noticed some peculiar behavior among the adult penguins and their young. The older penguins seemed to be teaching their offspring how to swim by nudging them into the water. It was both amusing and fascinating to watch as the young penguins hesitated before taking the plunge. The older penguins displayed a mix of tenderness and determination in guiding their young into the sea.

As we continued to observe, a group of penguins clumsily made their way towards the water. Some of them managed to navigate the rocky slope successfully, while others tumbled down in a comical manner. Once in the water, the penguins transformed, diving and splashing with incredible agility.

Despite initial concerns about the penguins' behavior, we found them to be peaceful creatures. Our encounter with these unique birds left us in awe of their abilities and behaviors. Eventually, as night fell, we faced a challenging journey back to our camp due to a sudden gale, forcing us to navigate the rough seas back to Penguin Island."|['1.

As Jack spoke, the wind suddenly changed direction, forcing us to adjust the sail to head towards the island. Strong gusts and squalls made our journey difficult. We trusted Jack's judgment, but anxiety crept in as the situation worsened. A heavy squall hit us, nearly capsizing the boat. Despite our efforts, water flooded in. Jack spotted a low rock ahead and steered us towards it. With skillful maneuvering, we found refuge in a narrow creek. Though safe, our surroundings were treacherous. The storm raged on, enveloping us in water. We sought shelter in a small cave, grateful for the dry respite. Nightfall brought darkness and terror, the storm intensifying. Lightning illuminated our precarious situation, while thunder roared, and waves threatened to wash us away. The dawn's arrival brought relief and gratitude for surviving the harrowing night.|['1.

For three days and nights, we stayed on a rock as a fierce storm raged. On the fourth morning, the storm suddenly stopped, but the sea was still rough. We were cautious not to set off in our boat. We barely slept during this time, but on the third night, we slept soundly and woke to a calm sea and a bright sun. With joy, we set sail for our island home, which was visible on the horizon. We rowed most of the day until a breeze allowed us to hoist the sail. Passing by Penguin Island, we reached our island at nightfall. We rowed to shore and found our home untouched. We continued to live happily on the island, fishing, hunting, and exploring. The climate was delightful, and we made clothes and useful items. Diving in the Water Garden brought us joy, and we felt at home in the water.|"['1.

Jack and I were sitting on the rocks at Spouting Cliff, and Peterkin was wringing water from his clothes after falling into the sea by accident. Suddenly, we saw two objects on the horizon. Jack looked worried as he saw the approaching canoes. He warned us that the natives of the South Sea Islands were fierce cannibals. We quickly hid in the woods with clubs that Peterkin had made. As the canoes came closer, we saw one being chased by the other. The first canoe landed near us, and its crew prepared to defend against the other canoe's men. A brutal battle ensued with men wielding large clubs. The attacking chief, with yellow hair and a fierce appearance, stood out. The fight was intense and gruesome, and we couldn't look away.|"['1.

The chief with yellow hair was suddenly attacked by a strong man, armed with a heavy club resembling an eagle's beak. The two giants cautiously circled each other before deciding to attack simultaneously. With a wild shout, they swung their clubs, creating a loud impact. The yellow-haired savage stumbled, giving his enemy an opening, but a witness intervened by throwing a stone, turning the tide. The attacking savages fled towards the bush upon seeing their chief fall, but were all captured. The survivors were bound and left in the woods. Some savages lit a fire using a bow and drill, and a bound man was brought to the flames, horrifying the onlookers. The savages proceeded to kill and consume the man. Later, the savages dragged three women and two infants to the fire, where a young woman displayed a different race and modest demeanor. The chief callously tossed one of the infants into the sea, causing despair among the onlookers.|"[""1.

The young girl stood before the chief, who spoke sternly, pointing to the fire in a threatening manner. Jack was instructed to free the prisoners by cutting their bonds with a knife. With determination, Jack leaped into action, knocking down a man with a club and engaging in a fierce battle with the chief. Despite the chief's heavy club, Jack's quick and precise strikes proved effective. As the chief tired, the other savages moved closer, anticipating Jack's defeat. In a final desperate move, Jack struck the chief between the eyes, causing both of them to collapse. The savages hesitated, giving the prisoners and their allies the opportunity to defeat them.

After the fight ended, the natives gathered around us, curious and asking questions we couldn't understand. Jack, wanting to show goodwill, shook hands with the chief, and the others followed suit. Then, Jack went to the girl who had been watching from a rock. He signaled for her to come with him. But as they were about to leave, Jack noticed the baby left on the shore, alive. He rushed to help the baby and its mother who was starting to recover. Jack comforted the mother by placing the baby on her chest, bringing her great joy. He then led the group to a bower where they shared a meal of roast pig, ducks, fish, and fruits. Afterward, everyone fell asleep, exhausted from the day's events. When they awoke, it was already midday. Jack, eager to start the day, woke his friends, and they prepared for breakfast.|['1.

For a few days, the natives repaired their damaged canoe after it hit the shore. This canoe was unique, about thirty feet long, with a tall stern. The most interesting part was the out-rigger, a long plank attached to the canoe by cross beams to prevent tipping over. The boys helped load the canoe with food and fruit for the departing prisoners. They also hunted hogs for a special meal. The natives suggested the boys join them on their island, but the boys declined. As a parting gift, they gave the natives their axe, a wood piece with their names carved on it, and string as a necklace. The natives rubbed noses as a farewell gesture. The boys felt a mix of sadness and relief as they watched the canoe disappear, reflecting on the recent events.|"['1.

One day, while enjoying ourselves in the Water Garden, Peterkin signaled us urgently from above. We rushed to him, realizing a pirate ship was approaching our island.

Not all are at ease in the water, feeling a dread of being submerged even briefly. Peterkin faced this fear bravely, allowing himself to be pulled down ten feet into a dark cavern to escape approaching pirates. With resolve, he followed his friends into the cave. Once safe on a ledge, they dried off and explored their surroundings. They settled in for the night, finding provisions they had stored earlier.

A small silver lamp hung from a beam, casting a soft light over the cabin, a modest apartment. The captain, seated at a table examining a chart of the Pacific, greeted me calmly. He shared his trade as a sandalwood trader and offered me a role on his crew. Though surprised, I agreed until we reached a civilized island for my return. Three weeks later, on a calm day in the Pacific, I watched porpoises swim around the ship. The captain, known as Bloody Bill, stood at the tiller, gazing into the deep blue water. Despite his taciturn nature, I found him intriguing. The crew lazed under an awning, and the ship gently swayed on the tranquil sea, creating a serene atmosphere.|"['1.

Bill sternly replied to the young man that he preferred not to speak in the presence of others who cursed and swore. The young man expressed his desire for friendly conversation, mentioning his longing for pleasant words. Bill agreed, and the young man enthusiastically shared stories of his happy days on a Coral Island. Suddenly, the atmosphere changed as a trader approached in a hurry, and the crew sprang into action. The captain fired a shot across the trader's bow, revealing a hidden brass gun. Boarding the trader, they found a surprising crew of unclothed and unarmed black men, led by a comical figure in mismatched European clothes. The trader, named the _Olive Branch_, was a missionary ship carrying an unusual cargo of coconuts, pigs, cats, and the Gospel from Aitutaki to Rarotonga.|"['1.

The crew on the vessel reacted to the announcement with laughter, quickly silenced by the captain. His demeanor changed from stern to friendly as he greeted the missionary. The captain then conversed with the missionary before returning to the deck and ordering the crew into the boat. They sailed away, leaving the _Olive Branch_ behind. Some crew members speculated about the captain's behavior towards the missionary, suggesting it was due to the benefits of having gospel representation on the islands they visited. The crew encountered a group of hostile natives on a small island, prompting a tense standoff that was diffused by the captain's intervention.

A deafening roar echoed over the sea as the brass gun fired into the mass, creating chaos. The survivors fled to the woods as the wounded writhed in agony.

I was very shocked to hear about the brutal ways of the natives from Bill, who had experience trading in the islands. He shared a chilling story of how a captain he sailed with callously killed a friendly chief over a trade disagreement and even shot six locals to protect his business. Bill explained that shipwrecked individuals, dead or alive, were doomed to be roasted and eaten by the natives. He mentioned a tragic incident where three survivors of a shipwreck were captured and devoured by the islanders. Bill advised that escaping from the current ship might be risky, but heading to islands near Tahiti where the natives were Christians could offer safety. Despite not understanding Christianity fully, Bill believed it transformed the natives into peaceful people. He suggested that they could plan to escape by cutting the boat adrift one night during their watch, but the dangers of being caught by the islanders made it a risky plan.|['1.

Bill bid me farewell, and a crewmate took his place at the helm. Not inclined to chat, I gazed at the glowing waves while feeling sorrowful. Memories of my time on the Coral Island with friends Jack and Peterkin made me tearful. I worried about their search for me. Suddenly, a red glow in the south and distant thunder caught our attention, followed by a shower of ashes from a volcano many miles away. As we sailed onward, the volcano's glare and thunder persisted. Days later, we neared a lush island with two towering mountains and a river leading to the shore. The island was known for sandalwood, but the crew's past actions had strained relations with the natives. Upon anchoring, the captain and armed crew rowed ashore to meet the island's chief, Romata, who welcomed them warmly.|"[""1.

After a brief chat, we were served a meal of roasted pigs and various roots. We ate modestly before getting down to business. The captain explained his reason for coming to the island, expressed regret for any past misunderstandings, and hoped for a successful trade. Romata, the chief, said he had forgotten any previous issues, was happy to see his friends, and offered help with wood cutting. Terms were agreed upon, and as we were leaving, Romata joined us on the ship. He mentioned that another chief from a different island was visiting and would be entertained the next day. Romata asked to introduce him to us and sent for his two pets, a rooster and a parrot. The visiting chief had half of his face painted red and the other yellow. He admired the ship and was fascinated by a musket, mistaking it for a tree-cutting tool. Romata was amazed by the ship's cannon and requested a demonstration, which left him in awe. The visiting chief was particularly intrigued by the ship's pump and spent the day pumping water out of the ship.|['1.

The following day, the crew disembarked to harvest sandalwood, while the captain and a couple of men stayed aboard, ready with a brass gun aimed directly at the chief's house. The men were armed, and I was instructed to join them. As we traversed the lush groves of banana, coconut, and breadfruit trees, we encountered plum and banyan trees, similar to those on the Coral Island. We also saw taro roots, yams, and sweet potatoes growing in fenced areas. We reached a clearing with bamboo houses thatched with pandanus leaves, where natives gathered to watch us pass. After reaching the sandalwood area, I climbed a nearby hill for a better view. At midday, the chief arrived with food for the men, and I learned about the local customs, including the _tabu_ tradition and the presence of Tongan Islanders among the natives.|"['1.

""Ay, babies,"" returned Bill. ""Your soft-hearted folk at home would say, 'Oh, horrible! impossible!' to that, and then go away as comfortable and unconcerned as if their sayin' 'horrible! impossible!' had made it a lie. But I tell you, Ralph, it's a _fact_. I've seed it with my own eyes the last time I was here, an' mayhap if you stop a while at this accursed place, and keep a sharp look out, you'll see it too.

The next day, I went ashore with the wood-cutting group once more. During lunchtime, I wandered alone into the woods, not feeling hungry. As I walked, I unexpectedly reached the sea-shore after crossing a narrow piece of land separating the village from a vast bay. There, I saw islanders preparing a war-canoe for launch. The canoe amazed me with its length of a hundred feet, spacious enough for three hundred men. It had a high stern-post and an unwieldy out-rigger. Intrigued, I watched the natives work. Nearby, children played games joyfully. They engaged in various activities like blind-man's-buff, walking on stilts, and even a peculiar game of enlarging their eyes with straw. The kids also flew kites and swam expertly in the sea, showcasing their remarkable skills and delighting in the water.|['1.

Bill explained to Ralph how the natives enjoyed a thrilling game in the sea. They swam out with short boards, rode the waves, and surfed back to the shore, shouting with excitement. Tararo, an old friend, surprised Ralph with a warm greeting. Tararo revealed that a Samoan woman named Avatea was with him. She had been captured in war and kept by Tararo, but she refused to marry the chief he chose for her. If she didn't comply, she would be given to another chief as a sacrifice. Suddenly, a shark attack occurred, causing panic among the swimmers. Despite efforts to save a man, the shark prevailed, leaving a chilling reminder of the dangers of the sea.|['1.

In many countries, such a spectacle would have deeply affected the onlookers. However, the islanders were unfazed and quickly left the sea, concerned that others might suffer a similar fate. Their disregard for human life did not interrupt their activities. Although the surf-swimming abruptly stopped, they resumed other games without hesitation. The islanders, indifferent to the danger of sharks, continued their amusements. The natives engaged in wrestling and boxing matches, causing injuries due to their lack of technique. The spectators cheered as the combatants displayed their strength. Despite the brutality, the intricate tattoos on the chiefs and men were striking. The painful process of tattooing was described, with elaborate designs adorning the bodies of the islanders.

As we made our way to the beach, a horrific sight unfolded before us. Men in our party showed no emotion, just indifference or contempt. Witnessing such callousness towards violence made me reflect on my own desensitization after weeks of exposure to bloodshed. Surrounded by pirates and savage natives, I felt helpless and prayed for deliverance. The captain's sour mood led to tensions with Romata, the chief. I was tasked with gifting Romata whale teeth to appease him. Despite their seemingly paltry value, they held great significance to the natives.

I witnessed a horrifying scene where savages launched their war-canoe over living victims, causing unimaginable suffering. The inhuman monsters showed no mercy as they callously continued their gruesome act. The captain and first mate discussed a plan to retrieve cargo from the savages.

After dark, Bill swam ashore and rigged a musket to a tree with a string attached to the trigger to alarm the village without hindering their escape. When the crew rowed silently to shore, the plan failed as the musket misfired. A shot rang out, causing chaos in the village. The captain cursed the premature shot as the crew charged the savages. Shots echoed through the woods as the crew battled the natives. Meanwhile, a large group of natives approached from the rear, threatening to ambush the crew. The narrator, standing in the boat, feared for the crew's safety as the sounds of battle and cries filled the night air.|"[""1.

The battle cries faded, and cheers from the savages signaled defeat for our men. Panic gripped me. Captured by the savages was unthinkable, fleeing futile, and sailing the schooner solo impossible. Desperate, I readied to sail when a crewmate's scream froze me. Savages murdered them. Bill, leaping into the boat, urged me to row. As we fled, savages gave chase. One latched onto the stern, but Bill's swift action saved us. A cannon blast thwarted the savages' advance, and we escaped. The ordeal drained me, but adrenaline kept me going until safety was assured. The relief brought a sudden exhaustion, and as the island disappeared from view, I succumbed to unconsciousness.|"[""1.

"""Hello! Ralph, wake up, we're safe now. Poor thing, I think he's fainted,"" said the man, gently placing Ralph on the sail on the deck. He offered Ralph some brandy to help him feel better.

After examining the wound from the pistol shot, Bill explained the unfortunate events that led to the injury. Despite a mishap with his musket, a sudden thought saved them from danger. Bill's quick thinking caused a distraction, allowing them to escape. However, the captain, believing it was intentional, shot Bill in the chest. Bill recounted the horrific scene of the captain's demise at the hands of savages. With the future ahead of them on the Pacific, they decided to sail towards the Coral Island to reunite with old friends. Bill, weakened by his ordeal, was assured that they could manage the schooner together. They planned how to navigate the vessel and take turns steering, ensuring they would reach their destination safely.

""Don't lose hope, Bill,"" I comforted him, ""there's always a chance. Isn't there a Bible on board?""

""No, the last one belonged to a boy who suffered greatly and died. The captain threw it overboard after the boy's passing.""

I felt a pang of guilt for neglecting my Bible. I realized I couldn't recall a verse to comfort Bill. After much thought, a text came to mind. Bill confessed his troubled past as a pirate, feeling his fate was sealed.

As the wind suddenly struck, the schooner bravely surged ahead, battling the rising sea like a gallant war-horse. Dark clouds loomed as the waves grew massive. With too much sail, I feared the masts might snap. The gale intensified, howling through the rigging. Abruptly, the wind veered, a huge wave crashed, nearly tipping the schooner over. Bill, thrown by the force, lay unconscious beside me. Battling the elements, drenched by the relentless waves, I struggled to keep the vessel afloat. After the storm passed, I tended to Bill, but he was gone. Alone in the vast Pacific, with limited navigation skills, I steered towards my destination. A week of steady winds propelled me westward. Despite setbacks, I managed to hoist the sails, learning through trial and error, reflecting on the value of knowledge gained through experience.|['1.

I was anxious about another storm, but I prepared by loosening the sails to weaken their power. I kept an eye on the barometer for sudden drops to adjust the sails quickly. After two weeks of sailing smoothly, I felt closer to the Coral Island. While reading Captain Cook's voyages, I saw a strange light in the sea, caused by luminous creatures. A majestic albatross visited me, and I eagerly awaited daylight to spot the Coral Island.

After that, I eagerly gazed at the sails, regretting my hasty decision to lower them. I briefly considered raising the main-top sail again, but realized it would take too long and decided against it. With the island just two hours away at our current speed, I abandoned the idea. I busied myself preparing for our arrival, knowing my friends wouldn't be up before 6 a.m., and it was only 3. I readied the anchor, planning to dock opposite the bower. Luckily, the anchor was ready to use, saving me time. I raised the black flag and loaded the cannon. As we approached the reef entrance, I turned the ship towards the Water Garden. I dropped anchor, fired the cannon, and startled my friends who emerged from the bower. They recognized me, and we joyfully reunited in the water. After our emotional reunion, we spent three days catching up on our adventures.|"['1.

Peterkin took a deep breath, ballooning himself up like the frog in a fable. His sudden release of air upon reaching the open sea was deafening, followed by shouts of joy. As they searched for their lost friend, Ralph, hope waned. But a keg of gunpowder hinted at Ralph's survival. Jack and Peterkin, betting on Ralph's involvement, found the gunpowder useful.

Finally, we gathered our belongings from the bower, including the axe, pencil-case, broken telescope, pen-knife, hook, sail-needle, boots, pistol, and handmade costumes. These items were carefully stowed inside the bower. The boat was then lifted on board, and the heavy anchor was raised with the help of pulleys and blocks. With a steady offshore breeze, we set sail before sunset, leaving the island behind. Our voyage over the next two weeks was smooth and successful. The clipper bark sailed swiftly, guided by the wind. Despite our small crew, we managed the sails well. The journey led us to the island of Mango, where we discussed the dangers ahead. Jack emphasized the need to face the risks head-on before embarking on any mission. The island was inhabited by cannibals, with only a small Christian tribe offering some hope of protection.|['1.

Jack proposed a plan to run to the south side of the island and anchor near the Christian village to avoid being seen by the savages. Peterkin, confident that Tararo would be friendly, was eager to go. The schooner sailed south, arriving at Mango's south side before sunset. A canoe approached with a native who greeted Jack warmly. The native, wearing European clothes, was invited to the cabin for a chat. Peterkin, acting boldly, shared biscuits and water with the curious natives on deck. The teacher left in a canoe after a pleasant evening, leaving Jack to navigate the schooner to a good anchorage near the shore. Jack revealed that Avatea, a captive, wished to join the Christians but was kept by Tararo. Avatea, in love with a Christian chief on a nearby island, planned to escape. The next day, negotiations with Tararo were planned due to an upcoming battle among the heathen tribes.

The settlement was situated on a vast expanse of flat land, sloping gently from the sea to the mountain. The cottages were positioned a few hundred yards away from the beach, shielded from the sea's brightness by lush foliage of Barringtonia and other trees along the shore. The village, a mile long and perfectly straight, featured a wide road flanked by rows of tufted ti trees with delicate blossoms. Each native cottage, nestled under the trees, had well-maintained gardens and paths adorned with black and white pebbles. A striking church, seating over two thousand, stood prominently, built without a single iron nail using stone and bone tools. Upon arrival, the warm-hearted teacher and his wife welcomed us, dressed in a blend of native and European attire. The natives, clad in various forms of native cloth, gathered along the shore to greet us as we were led to the teacher's home for a lavish meal of baked pig, fruits, and vegetables.

The teacher shared an amusing anecdote with us in excellent English, despite his foreign accent. The next day, we strolled with him through groves of fruit trees and native cottages, learning about the islands of the Pacific. He explained that these islands fall into three categories: volcanic, limestone, and low coralline islands with lagoons.

About a month after I arrived, news reached me that the chief had passed away. He was the father of the current chief, who is now a devout member of the church. In this region, it is customary that when a chief dies, his wives are strangled and buried alongside him. Upon learning this, I rushed to his residence to try and prevent such a cruel act. Unfortunately, when I arrived, two wives had already been killed, and a third was in the process of being strangled. I made a fervent plea for her life, but it was too late; she had already perished. I then implored the son to spare the fourth wife, and after much hesitation, he agreed. However, within half an hour, the woman regretted her decision and insisted on being strangled, which was carried out. To my surprise, it turned out that the old chief was not actually deceased but was being buried alive as part of a custom where the heir deposes his father. Despite my efforts to intervene, the old chief was interred alive alongside his wives. Subsequently, the new chief, now in charge, approached me with his god and requested that it be burned. This act marked a significant turning point, as the village and church began to flourish under the light of Christianity. The teacher shared that while progress was steady, there were still many islands where the gospel had not reached, and the inhabitants were immersed in dark practices. The teacher urged us to|"[""1.

"""See that church and those cottages? The lime in the plaster makes them sturdy,"" the teacher explained. ""When the locals converted, I had them build their homes and this church. They gathered coral from the sea, piled it with wood, and set it on fire."" The coral turned to powder, astonishing them. They mixed it with water, celebrating with joy. The teacher made furniture, amazing them with a lathe. Jack invited us to witness a battle, despite not liking bloodshed. We trekked for two hours to an open hill where two groups faced off.

The teacher warned Jack about the dangers of dealing with the savage tribes. He decided to accompany them aboard the schooner as an interpreter to the heathen village. They set sail, displaying their brass gun to intimidate the savages. Upon anchoring, the natives showed signs of fear but eventually approached in a canoe. The teacher explained their peaceful intentions and desire to meet the chief. The crew engaged in prayers and hymns while waiting for a response. A savage informed them that the chief couldn't meet due to religious ceremonies. They agreed to land without weapons. The natives welcomed them and led them to a feast. Later, they were guided to the chief's temple, passing through the village, where the contrast between the heathen and Christian natives was evident.|"['1.

As we turned onto a wide path towards the hill, we heard the shouts of a group approaching from behind. We stepped aside into the bushes and watched as they drew closer. It was a procession of natives, some dancing wildly with painted faces and bodies in black, red, and yellow. Among them, a group of men carried planks with seated men tied to them. I felt a chill, fearing they might be victims of a cruel ritual. The men, however, were already deceased, having been part of a battle the day before. Following them was a man being led with his hands bound, showing no fear. The procession led us to a temple with a circular structure, littered with human bones and skulls. Inside, a priest dissected bodies with wooden knives. The bodies were then taken to be baked in a fire. The crowd rushed to a hill where a house frame awaited. Overwhelmed with horror and curiosity, we followed, feeling like we were in a nightmare.|['1.

Arriving at the site, we witnessed a large crowd gathered around a specific area. We edged closer and observed a wooden beam lying on the ground next to parts of a house frame. Near one end was a hole, deep and wide. Suddenly, the man with bound hands was brought into the circle. Although his hands were now free, his legs were tightly strapped together. The house post was then lowered into the hole, and the man placed beside it, his head below the surface and arms wrapped around the post. Earth was shoveled in until everything was covered and compressed. This was a customary ritual during the opening of a new temple or a chief's abode. Jack's face turned pale as we rushed back to our teacher, worried about Avatea's safety among the fierce savages. Upon our return, Tararo and his followers arrived with food baskets. Jack demanded Avatea's freedom to join the Christians, but Tararo refused. Threatening with his ship's cannon, Jack insisted on Avatea's release. Suddenly, Avatea appeared among the fruits and vegetables, prompting Jack to rescue her, facing a fierce challenge from the natives until the teacher intervened. Tararo acknowledged Jack's bravery and allowed him to live but detained his schooner for further consideration.|"[""1. What was the purpose of lowering the house post into the hole in the ground?\nA.

"Upon reaching the deck, we descended to the cabin. Jack, feeling dejected, slumped onto a couch. The teacher, however, sat beside him, placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder. ""Do not succumb to anger, my young friend,"" the teacher comforted. ""We have three days granted by God. We must act to liberate this girl from slavery. We cannot afford to wallow in disappointment; action is imperative."" Jack, frustrated, questioned how he could act against a whole nation alone. The teacher advised patience and submission for success. He proposed a risky plan: to sail fifty miles south to an island of Christian natives, where the chief is Avatea's lover, ensuring her safety. To execute this plan, they must abandon the schooner. Jack, though hesitant, was urged to consider the sacrifice for Avatea's freedom."|"['1.

The teacher smiled and explained a daring plan to rescue Avatea. They would load a canoe with supplies, sneak to a secluded part of the shore, and paddle to safety. Jack, the teacher, and their comrades were willing to take the risk. They prepared for the voyage, gathered provisions, and prayed for a safe journey. Under the cover of night, they met Avatea, who eagerly agreed to escape. The teacher warned of the dangers, but Avatea was determined. After a tense day of avoiding suspicion, they rowed silently to the canoe. In the darkness, they set off, the only sounds the gentle lapping of the water. As they reached the waiting canoe, a shadowy figure emerged, ready to embark on their risky quest for freedom.|['1.

"Jack whispered to the teacher, ""Help me push off the canoe gently. Peterkin, get those blankets aboard. Avatea, stand in the middle."" With a final squeeze from the teacher, they paddled away swiftly. Jack steered south using a compass, while Peterkin and Ralph paddled in the bow. Avatea worked tirelessly in the middle. Peterkin jokingly suggested feeding Avatea while she slept, but Jack dismissed the idea. Peterkin's loud yawn woke Avatea momentarily. Jack advised him to save some food for the next day. The journey continued in near silence, with Ralph lost in thought about sleep.

Our paddles swiftly sliced through the water, propelling our canoe like a dolphin over the calm sea. Jack's hopeful voice cut through the tension as he spotted what seemed like land ahead. Despite the odds, we paddled with all our might, determined to outpace our pursuers - a war-canoe filled with fierce warriors. Our hearts sank as the supposed land turned out to be a fog bank, dashing our hopes. Exhausted and facing imminent capture, we turned to confront our enemies. Jack and Peterkin stood defiantly, ready to defend, while I gripped my paddle tightly. The enemy canoe thundered towards us, and before we could react, their prow struck us, sending us into the sea. Bound and helpless, we were taken captive, enduring a grueling journey without food, water, or relief.|"['1.

While we were taken to the shore, we saw Avatea sitting in the back of the canoe, not restrained. Our captors pushed us towards Tararo's hut where the chief sat, looking unfriendly. Our teacher stood nearby, anxious. Jack explained they hadn't misused the hospitality as it wasn't offered. He came to save Avatea, regretting his failure. Suddenly, they were seized and taken to a cave in the cliff, left in darkness. Feeling around, they found a ledge to sit on. Jack regretted his hastiness, feeling hopeless. Ralph expressed hope that divine intervention might save them. Suddenly, the barricade was removed, and they were led through the forest to the village.

In the village, the dreadful scene unfolded. Roofs were ripped off houses, some structures flattened to the ground. Natives scurried about, saving goods or themselves from the swirling destruction. The tempest was fierce on land, but fiercer at sea. Enormous billows rose from the deep, crashing onto the beach, shaking the earth. Waves surged higher, flooding the village, wrecking homes. Seeking food, famished, we forgot danger, focusing on survival. Captured once more, despite resistance, we faced an uncertain fate. Confined, fear loomed, longing for freedom grew. Despair set in, yearning for release, even death. Amid darkness, flickers of hope emerged, reminiscing about the past, distracting from the grim present. Peterkin dreamt of our Coral Island home, a stark contrast to our reality. Imprisonment took its toll, dimming our spirits. Jack's comforting words eased Peterkin's sorrow, uniting us in silent solidarity. Unexpectedly, our captor freed us, leaving us stunned and uncertain.

I was wrong. The savage cut our bonds, and we followed him out of the cave. To our surprise, our teacher stood under a tree, tears streaming down his face. He embraced Jack, saying we were free. A missionary had arrived, and the island embraced Christianity. The people burned their wooden gods. Overwhelmed by the sight, we cheered, feeling a rush of emotions. Natives greeted us warmly, leading us to Tararo's dwelling. The chief sat with a teacher and a missionary. The missionary welcomed us, grateful to save us. Tararo credited our freedom to the gospel.

As Jack spoke, Avatea's lover guided him to where Tararo and the missionary were surrounded by the tribal chiefs. Avatea stood by Jack's side while her lover stood on the other, commanding silence. He expressed gratitude for Jack's bravery and selflessness in risking his life for Avatea. Jack humbly replied that he would help any person in need. The missionary translated, emphasizing the kindness of true Christians. Jack quickly shook the chief's hand and retreated. The trio, Jack, Ralph, and Peterkin, decided it was time to prepare to return to England. Peterkin wished to see the false gods burned before they left, and his wish was granted. The burning of the idols marked a significant moment for Mango. The group reflected on the inevitability of parting ways and the importance of cherishing fleeting moments.
