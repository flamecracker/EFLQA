Many lovely Sundays followed. The grandmother always tried to find a spare moment for Stineli, but the housework kept increasing. Rico spent hours at the threshold of his cottage, hoping to see Stineli. By September, as people sat outside enjoying the warm evenings, the schoolmaster, looking thin and coughing, fell ill. He pondered what would happen after his death, especially concerning his fiddle. Remembering Rico playing the instrument, he decided he'd rather leave it to the boy than to a distant cousin. With a fever growing, he realized he couldn't take anything with him. In a rush, he sent for the grandmother. Rico, overwhelmed with joy, received the fiddle, forgetting about food and time. When he finally came to his senses, he went to find the grandmother in the kitchen, where Stineli joyously greeted him.|"['1.

After some thought, the kind lady decided to accompany Rico to the schoolhouse. She quickly put on a clean apron before they made their way over. Once there, the grandmother entered first, followed by Rico with his fiddle. The schoolmaster, looking very weak, lay on his bed. Rico, with tears in his eyes and a sparkle of hope, approached the teacher, who nodded in understanding. The grandmother was beckoned to come closer. The teacher asked her to say the Lord's Prayer as he felt troubled. As she prayed, Rico joined in. The room fell silent. Shortly after, the grandmother closed the teacher's eyes as he passed away. Holding Rico's hand, she led him back home. Under the golden sun, overlooking the lake, Stineli and Rico sang a song they had created. Stineli encouraged Rico to play his fiddle and sing at taverns for food and shelter. They lost track of time in their joy and were reminded by the darkening sky and Stineli's grandmother looking for them. Stineli excitedly shared their song with her grandmother, who was not impressed and scolded them for being late for supper.|"['1.

The next day, while the big family in the other cottage had supper, the cousin ran over, worried about Rico. She explained he hadn't been seen since the day before, and the door was found unlocked. The cousin then accused Rico of deceit and predicted a troubled future for him. The grandmother intervened, suggesting Rico might have a complaint against someone who had wronged him. The cousin, feeling guilty, left to check if Rico had returned. From that day on, she refrained from speaking ill of Rico. Stineli's father decided to search for Rico near the glaciers. Stineli, distressed, couldn't eat or sleep. The family noticed her change and decided she needed goat's milk. After three weeks, Stineli confessed to her grandmother that Rico's disappearance was her fault.

The grandmother managed to calm Stineli down to hear the whole story about the lake, which she hadn't known about. Stineli explained how Rico always talked about the lake and wanted to find it. She suggested a way for him to go, and it seemed likely Rico had set off. But her father's mention of ravines dashed Stineli's hopes. The grandmother took Stineli's hand, saying the lesson learned from this mistake was that children shouldn't run off into the unknown without telling their parents. Stineli prayed for things to turn out right. Rico, wearing his Sunday clothes and carrying his fiddle, sneaked out at dawn to find the lake. Tired and hungry, he watched a post-wagon driver share bread and cheese with his horses, longing for the driver's carefree life.|"[""1.

Rico, feeling famished, eagerly accepted the driver's offer of a generous slice of bread and cheese. The driver, amused by Rico's presence, questioned the young musician about his journey to Lake Garda. Impressed by Rico's appearance and demeanor, the driver offered him a ride on the coach. Rico was astonished but thrilled at the unexpected opportunity. As the coach set off on the journey, Rico was overwhelmed by the kindness of the passengers who showered him with coins for his music. Eventually, the coach stopped for a break and a meal. Rico was treated like a guest of honor, with everyone serving him food generously.

As the coach slowed down, the students requested more music. Rico played all he could remember his father playing. Eventually, a soothing tune made everyone doze off. The night brought a gentle breeze and stars filling the sky. Rico thought of Stineli and the grandmother, realizing it was time for the evening prayer. He joined in, praying under the starlit sky before nodding off. When he woke, the driver helped him down. The students bid him farewell warmly, asking to greet Stineli. Alone in the dark, Rico spotted a lantern by a stable. He thanked the coachman and was about to be handed over to a sheep-dealer heading to Bergamo.

Rico was exhausted after a day of fiddling and singing, barely managing to eat before falling asleep in the big bedroom. The next morning, ready with his fiddle, they had breakfast before embarking on their journey. Rico was amazed when they turned a corner and saw Lake Garda. The man paid for their passage but refused Rico's silver piece, thinking the boy might need it later. As they traveled by train, the man arranged for Rico to stay in Bergamo, instructing him to alight there. The conductor guided Rico off at Peschiera, leaving him in an unfamiliar place. Rico wandered until he recognized the lake and mountains, but the cottage he sought was nowhere to be seen. Despite the familiar surroundings, the absence of the cottage puzzled him.|"['1.

"Rico ran down the road, memories flooding back. He recalled crossing the stone bridge with his mother holding his hand. Tears streamed down his face as he remembered her loving gaze.

"When Mrs. Menotti noticed Rico's absence, she assumed he had left quietly to not upset Silvio further by saying goodbye, and she appreciated his consideration. Sitting next to Silvio, she explained, ""I need you to understand, Silvio, so you'll stop misbehaving. I can't take you away from someone, just like I can't take Rico from the landlady. She could take you from me. Then you wouldn't see the garden or flowers anymore, and you'd have to sleep alone in the room Rico dislikes. Remember what he told you? What would you do then?"" Rico walked through the garden, down to the lake, and sat in his favorite spot, feeling like he had no home in the world. Silvio, knowing Rico wouldn't come for two days, cried incessantly.

Two friends were excitedly discussing how to bring Stineli to Silvio, who was unwell and yearning for her company. Silvio's mother, Mrs. Menotti, hoped the night would calm Silvio's longing for Stineli. However, Silvio persisted, insisting that only Stineli could make him feel well again. Mrs. Menotti found it hard to see her son suffer and hoped his fancy for Stineli would pass. Silvio's persistent desire worried his mother, and she sought advice and support.

Silvio's room was quiet as his mother gathered grapes and figs in the garden. Silvio eagerly awaited Rico's visit, and when the door opened, it was the priest.

Stineli never lost hope, even after grieving for her grandmother's loss. Every day, she missed her grandmother and Rico, feeling the world was less beautiful without them. One sunny Saturday, carrying straw for brushes, she saw a lad approaching. As the lad drew closer, Stineli realized it was Rico. Excitedly, she welcomed him inside. The family didn't recognize Rico, but Stineli revealed his identity. Rico shared his adventures, mentioning Mrs. Menotti and Silvio, proposing to take Stineli with him.

Stineli became increasingly important to little Silvio with each passing day. Silvio felt it was a misfortune if she went outside even for a short while. However, when she stayed with him, he was obedient and calm, doing everything she asked without bothering his mother like before. Stineli was a delightful companion, always turning everything into a game. She had a way with children, learned many words from Silvio, and could chat with him effortlessly. Mrs. Menotti praised Stineli's impact on Silvio and the household, calling her a treasure. Despite the joy they shared, Rico's mood darkened as night fell, hinting at hidden worries. Stineli tried to comfort him, reminding him of the upcoming dance evening across the lake. On Saturday, Rico played melancholic tunes on his violin, expressing deep sorrow.

The kind girl prayed earnestly for her friend Rico, realizing the comfort in the prayer. She returned to the garden, troubled by Rico's situation, debating whether to confide in Mrs. Menotti. Stineli felt the weight of Mrs. Menotti's distress as she shared her guilt about possessing a property left by a friend who never returned. Mrs. Menotti was torn between enjoying the property and feeling like it was a punishment from God for keeping it unlawfully. The story unfolded with the friend leaving the property to Stineli's husband, who kept it in good condition, waiting for his return. However, circumstances changed, and the property became more valuable due to a railway construction project. Stineli grappled with the moral dilemma of benefiting from the property while feeling the burden of guilt and uncertainty.|"[""1.

On a beautiful autumn morning, Mrs. Menotti contemplated her feelings in the garden. Rico visited, bringing his violin, and played music with Stineli and Silvio, lightening the mood.

Realizing Rico was unaware of the circumstances, Mrs. Menotti explained everything in detail, ensuring everyone understood the situation. With the house partly belonging to Rico, he could take possession immediately, and their happiness knew no bounds.

Rico was urged to keep things unchanged in the house and to think of Mrs. Menotti as their mother. The household celebrated their newfound joy with a song, expressing their happiness. The next day, Rico followed Mrs. Menotti's advice, informing the landlady of the change and securing his new home.

The news spread throughout Peschiera, with everyone elated for Rico. Mother Menotti made sure Rico felt at home in his new abode, setting up a beautiful room for him overlooking the garden and lake. The four friends enjoyed their days together, oblivious to the passing time.

"On a chilly January evening, the snow crunched under the children's feet as they hurried up a hill, dragging their sleds behind them. The frozen fields around them were like icy highways, perfect for sleigh rides. The kids, flushed with excitement, raced to the top of the hill, eager to slide down again. Amidst the shouts of ""Once more!"" and the laughter, a scuffle broke out as three boys argued about who reached the peak first. Cheppi, in a fit of anger, tried to kick snow at a timid girl watching nearby. However, a classmate named Otto intervened, defending the girl and scolding Cheppi for his behavior. Eventually, the girl, named Wiseli, got a chance to sled down the hill on the fastest sled, thanks to Otto's kindness. Grateful, she thanked him with her eyes and a shy smile before running off joyfully. Otto, accompanied by his little sister, left for home, feeling content after standing up for Wiseli."|"['1.

"""Oh! I can see the whole thing just as it happened as plainly as if it were only yesterday,"" said Max, quite animated over his memories. ""I must tell you all about it, Otto. You have probably heard from your wife that we had here, in the happy time of our childhood, an old schoolmaster, whose creed was that all faults could be whipped out of, and all virtues be whipped into, the children under his care. So he felt himself constrained to whip a great deal either for one thing or the other, and very often for both at once. Andrew's turn came one day, and the master applied his well-meant rule so heartily that poor, thin Andrew screamed with pain. At this moment my little sister, who had only entered the school a short time before, and did not understand the rules very well, stood up from her seat and hastened to the door. The teacher held his hand for a moment, and shouted after her, 'Where are you running to?' Marie turned about. The tears were running down her cheeks, and she said, very decidedly, 'I am going home to tell my father.' 'Wait, I will teach you!' cried the master, in the greatest surprise, and sprung after the girl.

About a year ago, Wisi's husband had a terrible accident in the workshop, leaving him very ill and unable to work. Sadly, he passed away six months later, leaving Wisi to care for their child alone. Max, Wisi's brother, believed that things would eventually get better for her, but his sister disagreed, feeling it was too late for that. Late one night, after reminiscing about the past, Max's sister decided it was time for bed. As they left, Max playfully woke up his brother-in-law, the colonel, signaling it was time to leave. The house fell quiet, and down the hill, Wiseli hurried home, realizing she had stayed out too long. Finding her mother sitting in the dark, Wiseli shared her evening joy and then noticed her mother's unusual quietness. Wisi, feeling weary, asked Wiseli to fetch a lamp and some water.|"[""1.

When Wiseli arrived at her cousin Gotti's house in Beech Grove, she was met by three rowdy boys who stared at her intently. Her cousin's wife also appeared, eyeing Wiseli as if she were a stranger. Sensing Wiseli's hunger, Gotti offered her bread and cheese, but Wiseli sat frozen, not daring to touch the food. Gotti reassured her and urged her to eat, but Wiseli remained motionless. Cheppi, one of the boys, tried to help by grabbing the food, but a scuffle ensued between the boys. Gotti intervened, questioning the chaos.

The commotion continued as soon as the door shut, with the children grabbing each other's hair and making terrible noises. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, their mother peeled potatoes. When the father closed the door, their mother, Cousin Gotti, suggested that the new child could help with the work. The father agreed, saying the new child seemed less troublesome than their boys. The mother planned to make a bed for the child but was concerned about the cost. Despite the chaos, she handed Wiseli a big stocking to knit for Cousin Gotti.

The cousin's wife hurried around the kitchen, instructing Wiseli by showing her what to do next. Suddenly, there was a loud noise at the door. The cousin and his sons had arrived, shaking off snow from their shoes. The wife quickly prepared a meal, setting the table with spoons and knives. Wiseli, unsure of what to do, sat quietly until the cousin pointed out she needed a spoon to eat. The meal was quickly devoured, and the table cleared. The cousin then left to tend to a sick animal, leaving Wiseli to observe and learn.

Cheppi's father returned from the barn with two empty grain bags on his shoulders. He asked Cheppi to make room at the table and laid out the bags. Wiseli, feeling surprised, fetched her bundle. Gotti, Cheppi's cousin, placed the bundle on the bags. He assured Wiseli she could sleep comfortably by the warm stove. As Gotti left, he encouraged Wiseli to rest without worrying. Wiseli was left alone in the dark room. She felt the silence around her and the moonbeam shining through the window. Sitting on the bench by the stove, she finally had a moment to reflect on her day's events.

Pussy decided to give up her bed to Wiseli to avoid being sent to bed early every evening. When her father returned, her mother explained that Wiseli was an orphan and a new arrangement was needed.

The teacher left, and Otto hurried down the steps, across the square, and up the hillside. When he told his mother about the kind act, they pondered who the mysterious helper could be.

Otto comforted Pussy, promising to protect her from the man who scared her. He offered her the coveted red candy cock from the Christmas tree. This gesture calmed Pussy, and they resumed playing.

Meadow-Joggi, known for living in the meadow-land, was a simple man who helped neighbors with small tasks like carrying sand or sorting fruit. Despite his simplicity, he never caused harm.

Wiseli was unsure what to make of Andrew's kindness after her mother's passing. It felt like her mother's love had found a way into Andrew's caring words.
