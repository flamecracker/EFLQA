A fun adventure awaits Helen, Tom, and their friends at Snow Camp, a winter retreat deep in the wilderness. Despite some setbacks, like Mary declining the invite, the group is excited for the trip. With Mr. Cameron, Mrs. Murchiston, and a few servants, they head to the lodge by train. As they cross a field, a bull suddenly charges towards them, sending them running towards a steep bank by a creek. Ruth acts quickly, grabbing Helen's red cap and leading the way to safety behind an old hollow stump. The friends are relieved to escape the charging bull and continue their journey to Snow Camp, filled with laughter and chatter about the upcoming adventure.|"['1.

As Helen vanished over the bank, Tom hurried around the stump. Ruth, holding Helen's red cap, tripped over a root and tumbled to her knees near a hollow stump. Helen's cap got caught in a twig and was snatched from her hand. Ruth scrambled away, and the cap dangled in front of the stump, attracting a charging bull. The friends dove over the bank in haste, and a shrill yell startled them. The bull collided with the stump, causing a commotion. Tom and Ruth tried to move the stump but heard a struggle inside. Eventually, a trapped boy emerged from the water, saved by Ruth and Tom's quick thinking.|"[""1.

They pulled him to shore, where he collapsed, shivering and chattering near the creek. He was poorly dressed, and his clothes quickly froze from the water. The boy looked at them, unable to speak. They helped him up and guided him forward. Without the bull's return, they hurried to the public road, crossing the bridge and heading to the Red Mill. The boy continued to shiver and shake, feeling the icy water deep in his bones. Aunt Alvirah saw his urgent need and took charge, instructing them to bring him to Mr. Potter's warm bedroom. They removed his wet clothes, and Ruth hung them to dry. She found a note-case with a name and address, realizing the boy was from Scarboro, near Snow Camp where they were heading the next day.|"[""1.

Before Ruth could respond, the sound of a car horn was heard outside. Both girls hurried to the door. The Cameron car was descending the hill from Cheslow, stopping in front of the Potter farmhouse. The Red Mill, a picturesque grist mill by the Lumano River, was operated by Mr. Jabez Potter, producing various ground grains. Mr. Cameron, a jolly man, arrived with surprises for his children, Tom and Helen. He planned a backwoods trip to amuse them. Ruth Fielding, a helpful girl, was praised for her role in previous adventures. Mr. Cameron inquired about a patient inside, tended by Aunt Alviry, the caring housekeeper. Curious, they entered the bedroom to find a mysterious boy, buried in a feather bed, with pale blue eyes and a blank expression.|"['**1.

The boy hesitantly shared his tale, not an unusual one. He had journeyed most of the way on foot, working odd jobs for farmers and shopkeepers. Admitting to spending several weeks on the road, he revealed that he ended up in the hollow stump in Hiram Bassett's field by chance. While passing through the field towards the main road, he spotted Ruth, Helen, and Tom, and hid behind a tree to avoid being seen. Ruth returned to the kitchen after her friends left, noticing a newspaper clipping drying on the window sill. She picked up Fred Hatfield's father's old wallet left on the table by Mr. Cameron, dried it, and placed the clipping back inside. Curiosity led her to read the article, causing her face to pale. Ruth concealed the clipping in her dress as Aunt Alvirah entered, trying to compose herself. Throughout supper preparation, Ruth remained unusually quiet. Uncle Jabez Potter, a stern man who rarely smiled, arrived from the mill. Despite his austere demeanor, Ruth had discovered his kinder side, especially through his generosity towards her and others, like Mercy Curtis. Aunt Alvirah reassured Uncle Jabez about the boy's presence, explaining his condition and the need to warm him up.|"['1.

"""That's not possible, Uncle,"" Ruth chuckled, recounting their bull adventure and Fred Hatfield's visit. Despite her laughter, Ruth seemed troubled. She took the supper tray Aunt Alvirah prepared to the bedroom. The boy, with a fever from his creek plunge, ate with bright eyes and flushed cheeks. Ruth sensed his starvation and inner turmoil. Later, she watched him quietly as he ate. The boy, troubled, did not meet her gaze. Ruth understood his hunger but also his mental distress. As the house slept, Ruth, unable to rest, donned a robe and slippers, crept downstairs, and cracked open the kitchen door. In the moonlight, she saw the boy, wrapped in a blanket, trembling. He found a wallet, dropped it, and appeared to sob softly. Ruth realized he intended to sneak away. When he touched his clothing, Ruth subtly rattled the door latch, startling him. The boy froze, panting in fear."|"['1.

Ruth tried to open the door quietly, not wanting to disturb Uncle Jabez. She knew the boy, Fred Hatfield, wanted to escape, but she hoped he would stay until Mr. Cameron arrived in the morning. Ruth managed to keep Fred from leaving by sneaking his clothes back into the kitchen. The next morning, she found Aunt Alvirah up early, groaning about her back. Aunt Alvirah praised Ruth and mentioned how proud Uncle Jabez was of her. She encouraged Ruth to enjoy her time with the Camerons and her friend Helen. Ruth then went downstairs to help with breakfast, knowing that Uncle Jabez had already left for the mill. She figured Fred must be up by now, as Uncle Jabez would have called up if he was sick.|"[""1.

Ruth was right. Fred Hatfield was already dressed when they entered the kitchen at the Red Mill. Ruth focused on preparing breakfast without speaking to Fred, and Aunt Alvirah remained cheerful and talkative as usual. The morning was clear and sunny, and Ruth was excited about their upcoming journey into the woods near Osago Lake. After realizing Fred had disappeared, Ruth quickly put on her cap and sweater, grabbed her skates, and rushed outside. She found Fred on the ice, trying to run away. Ruth caught up to him and told him he must stay as Mr. Cameron expected him. Fred broke down in tears, and despite Ruth's mixed feelings of contempt and pity, she stayed by his side until the Camerons arrived. Mr. Cameron seemed to grasp the situation as he approached Ruth at the Red Mill.|"[""1.

"""Listen up,"" Mr. Cameron said to the boy, standing tall in front of him with a smile on his face. ""Tell me why you don't want to stay at home. I promise to keep it between us."" The boy seemed reluctant. Mr. Cameron sighed, ""I hate to see a young person so stubborn. I need to make sure everything is okay at home before you run off."" He then asked the boy to join them for the day. Despite the boy's attempt to escape, Tom stopped him and offered his coat for the ride. Ruth said goodbye to her family, receiving warm hugs from Aunt Alvirah.

"Several young people had gathered at the station in Cheslow to meet the Camerons and Ruth Fielding for a trip to Snow Camp. Among them were Bob Steele, a bashful yellow-haired boy, and Isadore Phelps, known as ""Busy Izzy"" due to his inquisitive nature. The girls, including Helen, Ruth, Belle, Luella, Jennie Stone, and Madge Steele, were chatting excitedly. As they boarded a northbound train with a private car lent by a railroad official, the group discussed plans for their time at Snow Camp. The landscape outside the train window transformed as they traveled north, with snow-covered fields and icy ponds coming into view. Despite their efforts, the group couldn't seem to cheer up Fred Hatfield, who appeared solemn throughout the journey, puzzling his companions."|"['1.

Ruth was troubled all day by a newspaper clipping she kept hidden. Should she tell Mr. Cameron or Fred about it? As they neared Scarboro, she grew more uncertain, and Fred appeared sullen. When the train stopped, Fred tried to run off, but Ruth followed and caught up with him at a country store. Fred felt she had been watching him all day, making it hard for him to escape. At the store, the only sounds were the mules hitched to a wagon. Despite the cold, Ruth's determination to keep an eye on Fred led her to stop him from running away.|['1.

Fred glanced at Ruth and continued running. The engineer whistled for the flagman's return, but no one, not even the train crew or the private car passengers, noticed the boy and girl who had left the train carelessly. Ruth, focused on following Fred, didn't see the rear brakeman's lantern approaching. Quickly, he jumped onto the private car as the train started moving. Desperate to escape Ruth, Fred leaped onto a timber wagon, expertly handling the mules. Ruth, frightened, realized the danger as the mules sped away. Fred, skilled with mules, managed to control them as they journeyed through the deep woods. The snow on the ground aided their visibility as they traveled deeper into the forest, guided by the wagon's tracks.|"[""1.

Ruth was worried about what her friends would think if they couldn't find her, and how she would return to the railroad. Would Mr. Cameron come looking for her? Her thoughts were interrupted by a wild scream from the bushes nearby. The mules stopped abruptly, startled by the noise. A panther had leaped down from a tree, causing panic. Ruth remembered seeing a panther at a circus and was terrified by its sleek, menacing presence. The mules galloped in fear, narrowly avoiding a direct encounter with the panther. The cat leaped onto the wagon but struggled to hold on as the mules sped through the woods. As they reached a fork in the road, the mules veered onto a narrow, bumpy path, shaking off the panther. The wild cat leaped off the wagon and disappeared into the bushes.|['1.

Fred swiftly attempted to calm the mules down to reduce their speed, but only exhaustion could slow them. Terrified, the mules kept bolting without reason, and the narrow road offered no space to steer them. The steep ascent of the road was the main factor in slowing the runaway mules. The path hugged the edge of steep cliffs, posing a threat to the wagon, mules, and passengers had they tumbled over. These perilous spots had initially scared young Hatfield, who knew the area well. Ruth, however, was doubly terrified as she felt completely lost. Fred yelled at the mules to halt, and they eventually paid heed, perhaps due to fatigue. A light suddenly shone ahead, guiding them through the darkness. Ruth, fearful of the forest's unknown dangers, bravely confronted Fred, who appeared more cowardly than menacing. The barking dogs quieted down as a light emanated from a nearby hut. An elderly hermit with a rifle emerged, observing Ruth and Fred with curiosity.|"[""1.

Ruth quickly summarized her adventure without mentioning Fred Hatfield's troubles. They had hopped onto a timber cart at the crossing, the mules bolted, a panther hitched a ride, and now they were here! The old man promised to take her home before bedtime. Ruth headed to his house while the boy helped with the mules. The old man chatted mostly to himself, barely looking at Ruth. The dogs, Tiger and Rose, welcomed her warmly. As she entered the cozy log cabin, a strange odor lingered. In a dark corner, a green chest with a window cover rustled. Ruth sat by the fire, flanked by the dogs. The old man prepared tea and cornbread, then startled Ruth by revealing two harmless snakes he kept as pets.|"['1.

The man lifted the cover of the chest and dropped something inside. There was a loud hissing sound. He then adjusted the lamp to illuminate a corner where Ruth saw a mass of snakes wriggling under an old quilt. Despite feeling scared, Ruth controlled herself. She enjoyed a cup of hot tea and cornbread by the fire. The man prepared snowshoes for them and they ventured out under the rising moon. He carried a rifle for safety. Ruth found walking in the snowshoes challenging but with help, she managed. They trekked through the snow, following a moonlit path. After a long journey, they reached a log cabin in the woods where the rest of the party was arriving.

In the woods, as the dogs barked and the hermit's hound bayed, a tall, thin man emerged from a log cabin. The Rattlesnake Man called out a greeting, and the hermit's hound rushed towards Ruth, proving her right to be there. With help, Ruth made her way to Snow Camp. There, she was welcomed by Mr. Cameron's maids who tended to her feet and prepared supper. Despite her exhaustion, Ruth inquired about the missing boy, Fred. The maids shared the concern of others who thought Ruth had been taken by mules. Mary, one of the maids, expressed fear of the wild creatures in the woods.

Long Jerry had not spotted the boy who was last seen with Ruth and the hermit at Snow Camp. Ruth avoided discussing the mystery as it had become quite baffling. Fred Hatfield's body was discovered in the river, yet a boy claiming to be Fred Hatfield was wandering around. The guide, a towering figure at almost seven feet tall, amused Ruth with his unusual height. He shared a humorous tale about encountering a bear while delivering aprons his mother had sewn.

Long Jerry found himself in quite a predicament when he decided to play a prank on a bear. He thought it would be amusing to throw his mother's bundle of aprons at the bear, but the bear didn't take it lightly. The bear growled and chased after Jerry. Realizing the danger, Jerry ran into the woods, trying to outrun the bear. However, the bear was faster and caught up to him. Jerry quickly climbed a small, round tree to escape the bear's wrath. The bear tried to grab him but missed by a hair's breadth. Jerry was terrified but managed to climb higher each time the bear tried to reach him.

When Ruth woke up, she felt stiff and sore from the bumpy ride on the timber cart with Fred Hatfield and the catamount, followed by her first snow-shoe walk. Despite feeling achy, she explored the log lodge eagerly, where the warm fires and hunting gear fascinated her. The lodge had a cozy hall with snowshoes and toboggans on the walls, creating a rustic atmosphere. Outside, a slide had been made on a hillside for sledding fun. As Ruth mingled with the other guests at Snow Camp, she had a serious discussion with Mr. Cameron about the mysterious boy who disappeared. They suspected the hermit might know something. Ruth's adventurous spirit had led her to risky situations, but Mr. Cameron praised her bravery while cautioning her to be more careful in the future.|"['1.

Ruth's soliloquy ended with a scream. A movement in the bushes caught her attention. Her dog, Reno, barked fiercely and lunged forward, but Ruth held onto his collar, keeping him in check.

Reno growled and dashed towards the bank, where a scream confirmed Ruth's fear of a nearby panther. Despite her efforts to stop Reno, he bolted towards the predator. The panther leaped into a tree, its claws shredding the wood in anger. Ruth knew the danger Reno faced as the panther prepared to strike.|"[""1.

Tom and his friends hurried through the snow, with the toboggan trailing behind. Busy Izzy joined the chase, all running towards a camp by a stream. The girls, trapped in the camp, cried out for help. Jennie Stone joked about being starved, while the girls were relieved and grateful for the rescue. The strange boy, in pain from the storm, needed medical attention for his back and legs. Ruth insisted on getting him help. The hermit, Rattlesnake Man, left once the boy was found, not wanting trouble. The group, including the girls, was taken safely to camp.

Mr. Cameron spoke kindly to the merchant, admitting he had been harsh with the boy, Fred. He believed Fred was not suited for the rugged life in the woods and offered him a job in the city. Despite Fred's shortcomings, Mr. Cameron felt everyone deserved a chance. The kids enjoyed their time at Snow Camp, creating a snow cavern for a candlelit party. Ruth returned home to the Red Mill, where she helped Uncle Jabez with his work. Uncle Jabez, though gruff, appreciated Ruth's efforts. He questioned her about a pin she wore, which was the emblem of her school club, the Sweetbriars. Ruth assured him they would become a popular club at Briarwood Hall.|"['1.
