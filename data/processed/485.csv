The shaggy man held an apple in one hand while freeing Toto from his pocket with the other. Toto rushed to Dorothy joyfully, wagging his tail. Dorothy, feeling lost in an unfamiliar place, sought guidance. The shaggy man reassured her that each road leads somewhere, urging her not to worry. As they pondered their next move, he mentioned that dogs, like Toto, often find their way home better than people. However, Toto's attempts to lead them back to the farm were in vain. Dorothy, reflecting on her strange experiences, felt bewildered at being lost so close to home. The shaggy man then revealed a Love Magnet, a horseshoe-shaped metal that he claimed would make everyone love him.|"['1.

The scruffy man sat quietly, pondering the bear and tiger situations, as Toto observed with keen interest. The little dog, recalling his pocket ride, planned to stay out of reach. Counting seven roads, they chose the seventh. Winding through meadows and trees, it led far from home. Dorothy feared being lost but pressed on. They encountered a boy in sailor attire digging a hole. Toto, intrigued, joined in. The shaggy man suggested the boy join their group. With Button-Bright, they journeyed cheerfully. Dorothy, accustomed to adventures, led the way with Toto and Button-Bright close.

Ahead, a grand arch spanned the road, intricately carved and adorned with vibrant colors. At the top, peacocks with stunningly painted feathers perched, while a fox's head in the center wore a crown and spectacles. Suddenly, fox soldiers emerged, dressed in bright uniforms with red bows on their tails and armed with wooden swords. The captain, affected by a Love Magnet, warmly greeted the travelers. Led by the captain, they entered a city with marble houses decorated with bird motifs. Foxes in feathered gowns observed from balconies. As they reached the royal palace, guarded by fox-soldiers, Dorothy noticed the carved fox head above the door. Inside, richly dressed foxes sipped tea served by fox-servants as they approached a grand doorway veiled in golden curtains.|['1.

The captain commanded everyone to mimic him, so the shaggy man drummed with his knees, as did Dorothy and Button-Bright. Toto couldn't join in, so Dorothy drummed for him, making him bark and irking the fox-captain. They found themselves in a grand room with a fox-king on a golden throne, surrounded by foxes in spectacles. Dorothy recognized the king and bowed respectfully. The captain introduced them, praising Dorothy's visit. The king welcomed them, offering to show them around. Dorothy felt puzzled by her journey and the shaggy man assured her it wasn't his doing. The fox-king admired Button-Bright's cleverness and shared his official name, King Renard the Fourth. The king praised Button-Bright's intelligence, leaving everyone impressed.|"['1.

The King, in a peculiar gesture, transformed Button-Bright's appearance, replacing his youthful features with a fox's head. The King, pleased with his work, found the fox head to be an improvement. Despite the King's approval, Button-Bright was distraught, touching his new nose and ears in disbelief. Dorothy and the shaggy man were concerned, while Toto barked at the unfamiliar sight. However, the foxes in the room praised Button-Bright's new look, offering comfort to the bewildered boy. Three fox-princesses admired his appearance, which lifted his spirits slightly. Dorothy, determined to seek help from Ozma, declined the King's invitation for dinner and theater, insisting on leaving promptly the next morning.|"[""1.

Button-Bright was scared to be by himself, so Dorothy brought him to her room. While one maid-fox fixed Dorothy's hair, another maid-fox groomed Button-Bright's face and head, adding pink bows to his ears. The maids suggested fancy feather costumes, but the children declined. Dorothy assured Button-Bright that Princess Ozma could change him back soon. They dressed for dinner and joined the shaggy man. The foxes at dinner wore exquisite feather outfits, making the guests' attire seem plain. The foxes served a lavish meal of fowl dishes. Later, they watched a play with fox actors. King Dox disliked Aesop's portrayal of foxes as cruel. The foxes explained they dressed to display their civilization. The shaggy man eagerly awaited an invitation to Princess Ozma's celebration in the Land of Oz. The Fox-King provided them with a lunch, and the fox-captain escorted them towards the next village, guarded to avoid any trouble.|"['1.

"When you reach their city, you'll discover more about them. Don't worry; Button-Bright is clever and has a smart face. He'll find a way to keep you safe,"" the captain assured. Dorothy and the shaggy man felt uneasy, unsure of Button-Bright's wisdom. As they bid farewell to their escort, they continued their journey. Toto happily roamed, barking at birds and chasing butterflies. The charming countryside lacked houses or people, only birds, rabbits, and busy ants. Walking briskly, they saw a beautiful girl dancing in the road. Dressed in vibrant colors, she danced gracefully until she noticed them. Tears welled in her eyes. Dorothy introduced her group and asked for advice on how to help the girl return home."|"['1.

""Come on,"" said the shaggy man cheerfully, and they resumed their journey. Polly walked with Dorothy, holding her hand tightly. Suddenly, Polly danced ahead, carefree once more. At noon, they shared a meal from the Fox-King's basket. As they sat, the shaggy man sliced turkey and shared it. Polly, still uncertain, enjoyed the food. Soon, they reached the city gates. A loud noise startled them as they entered the city. Inside, donkeys kicked metal sheets, creating the clamor. The shaggy man calmed the donkeys. The donkeys, wearing unique accessories, eyed the strangers nervously. Despite their clumsiness, Dorothy noticed their dexterity with their hooves."|"['1.

In the town, the houses were low, square, and made of bricks, all neatly whitewashed inside and out. Unlike regular streets, the houses were scattered randomly, making it tricky for strangers to navigate. A grey donkey, walking on his hind legs, joked about the need for streets and numbered houses for the less clever. They encountered two youthful donkeys whitewashing a wall with their tail-brushes. The group met King Kik-a-bray with a donkey head over the door. Inside, the king sat in a simple room with minimal furniture. When asked why they were there, the shaggy man complimented the king, who, pleased, decided to grant him a donkey head as a gift.

"""I can't undo things,"" the magician replied. ""You must find the Truth Pond to get back your head. But be cautious; this head is more beautiful than your old one."" Dorothy asked Polly about inviting the donkey king to Ozma's party. After a magical meal provided by the King, they were led to a simple house for the night.

As they journeyed, the group stumbled upon the first house they had seen in a while. Eager to investigate, they ventured into the valley. Initially, no one was in sight, but strange sounds emanated from the house as they drew closer. The peculiar music, reminiscent of a wheezy hand-organ, grew louder with each step. Eventually, they spotted a plump man in colorful attire sitting outside. The man introduced himself as Allegro da Capo, a self-proclaimed musical virtuoso. Despite his eccentricities, the shaggy man suggested they continue their quest to find the Land of Oz before the music drove them mad. With Polly dancing ahead and Toto showing disdain towards the musician, the group hastened away from the odd scene, traversing a rocky plain as the day waned and their meager lunch dwindled to just two apples.|"['1.

"""I should think you'd know,"" said the little girl, seriously. ""If it wasn't a fairy country you couldn't have a fox head and the shaggy man couldn't have a donkey head, and the Rainbow's Daughter would be invisible."" They moved ahead a bit faster to investigate what the dog was barking at and discovered a peculiar creature perched on a rock by the roadside. It resembled a man, of medium height and rather slender and graceful; however, its face was jet black, clad in a black cloth outfit resembling a union suit. The creature had the ability to switch from black to white, with a clown-like face and hair of brilliant purple. More of these creatures appeared, twisting their heads to show black or white by turns. The Shaggy Man realized they needed to escape the pocket in the rocks to evade the Scoodlers. Despite a brief scuffle where heads were thrown, they managed to move forward, with Toto even grabbing a Scoodler's head and causing a commotion."|"['1.

The Scoodlers, with their two faces and T-shaped feet, led the captives to a mountain that resembled an upside-down bowl. At the edge was a deep gulf with a narrow bridge leading to an arched opening into the mountain. Inside, a vast dome housed rock houses where the thin Scoodlers lived. The Queen, with fiery red and bright yellow sides, commanded her guards to make soup out of the captives. The shaggy man, using his Love Magnet, devised a plan to escape. He emptied a sack, and Polychrome distracted the guard by slapping his face. The shaggy man captured the guard's head and led Dorothy and Polly to flee across the bridge before the guard's body could stop them.|"['1.

Dorothy swiftly carried Toto and held Polly's hand, racing towards the cave entrance. The shaggy man lifted Button-Bright onto his shoulders and followed suit. Surprisingly, they neared the bridge when a Scoodler spotted them and alerted the others. As the Scoodlers chased them, Dorothy and Polly crossed the bridge. The Scoodlers began throwing their heads, aiming to stop them. The shaggy man defended them by catching and tossing the heads into the gulf. He even threw the Queen's head after the rest. With all the heads down in the gulf, the Scoodlers were left headless and confused. The group quickly left the cave, relieved to be free from danger. As they walked, they grew hungry and thirsty. Fortunately, they found a spring with ripe fruits, quenching their thirst and hunger.

"""It's nice of you, Polly,"" Dorothy said. ""But dancing on rainbows isn't my thing. They might be too soft and squishy to walk on, even though they look pretty."" The shaggy man pondered, unsure what to do, while Toto barked in agreement. Button-Bright started digging, lost in thought. Eventually, the shaggy man suggested using tree leaves for bedding. They settled down for the night, with the shaggy man staying up by the spring, lost in thought. Suddenly, he smiled, hinting at a plan.

He grabbed an axe and quickly chopped down a tree. Then, using a saw, he cut the trunk into large boards. With these boards, he built a boat about twelve feet long and four feet wide. From another tree, he fashioned a mast and rigged a sail using rope and canvas. After preparing the boat, they all boarded it. Dorothy sat at the front with Toto, while Button-Bright and Polly took their places too. The shaggy man raised the sail, and the boat sped across the sand. As they neared the end of the desert, they saw a line of rocks ahead. The boat crashed into the rocks, sending everyone flying into the green grass beyond.

"The sun quickly dried Button-Bright's sailor suit and the shaggy man's clothes. They were delighted to have their heads back and didn't mind the brief discomfort of getting wet. Polychrome danced ahead happily until she disappeared around a mound. Suddenly, they heard her shout ""Oh!"" and saw her running back towards them. As they turned the bend, they saw a round man made of shiny copper approaching with a yellow hen on his shoulder. The hen had fluffy feathers and wore a pearl necklace. Dorothy scolded Toto for trying to harm the hen, emphasizing that Billina was her dear friend. Dorothy introduced her companions to Tik-tok, a mechanical man, and explained how he needed winding up to speak.
