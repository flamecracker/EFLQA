"When Mr. Crow was younger, no one called him ""old Mr. Crow"" except behind his back, which didn't bother him. He spent many pleasant seasons in Pleasant Valley, where he helped by destroying insects that harmed crops. However, Farmer Green didn't appreciate Mr. Crow's help and set up scarecrows in the cornfield to scare the crows away. While the younger crows were frightened, Mr. Crow was too wise to be fooled.

The next day, with Johnnie's help, Farmer Green built a huge scarecrow in the cornfield. It was twice as tall as any man and had a shiny tin pan for a hat. Mr. Crow, a clever bird, was not happy when he saw the scarecrow. He thought it looked like a man with a gun. Upset, Mr. Crow decided to move away. But before he left, he saw a small bird land on the scarecrow's head and vanish. Mr. Crow felt careless and ate a lot of corn, which made him fat and out of breath. However, one day he noticed the scarecrow was replaced with a shorter one, but he didn't pay much attention. After a scare with Farmer Green, Mr. Crow lost his appetite for corn and worried about his health.|"['1.

After a rejuvenating winter in the South, Mr. Crow returned to Pleasant Valley feeling much better. He shared with his cousin Jasper Jay that he believed he could eat corn again. Mr. Crow was cautious around the men working in the cornfield, perching on a fence across the road to watch. His hunger grew, but he refrained from scratching up any corn that day. The following day, when the men had moved down the field, Mr. Crow seized the opportunity to dig up a kernel of corn. To his dismay, the corn had been coated in tar and wood-ashes by Farmer Green. Despite feeling deceived and angry, Mr. Crow stayed in Pleasant Valley until October, unaware that only the border of the field had tarred corn. In the end, Farmer Green's untarred corn won awards at the county fair, leaving Mr. Crow both disappointed and unable to fly due to the tar on his foot.|"[""1.

Old Mr. Crow was worried. He had never been in such a tough situation before. After wrapping his foot in a bandage at home, he rushed to see Aunt Polly Woodchuck, a reputed doctor. Mr. Crow asked about a cure, hoping to show his foot to friends in a week. Aunt Polly advised caution in eating, suggesting ginseng, Jimson weed, and elecampane, along with catnip tea. She warned against corn, grasshoppers, birds' eggs, field-mice, and elderberries, which could worsen his condition. Mr. Crow, who loved good food, found Aunt Polly's dietary restrictions challenging.

Mr. Crow followed Aunt Polly's advice and carried different foods in each pocket. When hunger struck, he checked his pockets for a meal. Starving upon reaching home, he found a kernel of corn, a last year's elderberry, and a bird's egg. After snacking on the corn and egg, he flew off to hunt more food. Some say he raided bird nests and caught a field-mouse, which escaped. Returning home satisfied, he discovered his swollen foot had healed overnight.|"['1.

Mr. Crow was cured of his foot trouble, but he felt disappointed that he hadn't shown all his friends his bandaged foot yet. He blamed Aunt Polly Woodchuck for curing him too soon. Aunt Polly clarified that he had eaten from the wrong pocket, not following her instructions. Despite this mix-up, Mr. Crow found joy in sharing his experience with others.

Mr. Crow found himself in a pickle when his friends crowded under his umbrella during a rainstorm.

Mr. Crow, holding his umbrella tightly, watched from his house, ready for the rain. His plan was set: the moment it rained, he would soar into the sky with his umbrella, seeking solitude without anyone to disturb him. With a swift leap from a tree branch, he found himself soaring higher and higher, drenched by the rain but clinging to his cherished umbrella. As he floated away, Mr. Crow passed mountains and startled Mrs. Eagle, who mistook his umbrella for a threat. Drifting farther from home, Mr. Crow faced a dilemma: should he release the umbrella to descend or hold on, valuing it as the sole umbrella in Pleasant Valley?

Fatty proposed a deal to Mr. Crow at Mr. Frog's tailor shop. Fatty offered to remove the buttons from Mr. Crow's coat so he could easily take it off anytime.

"One evening, Johnnie Green asked his father where a flock of crows was heading. The birds were flying fast towards the pine woods at the foot of Blue Mountain. These crows were rushing to a meeting, called a caucus, led by old Mr. Crow. But when Mr. Crow arrived late, he found a stranger speaking loudly instead of him. The stranger complained about hard times with fewer grasshoppers, tar on corn, and stolen chickens. Everyone except Mr. Crow agreed with the stranger.
