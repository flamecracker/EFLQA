Patty Fairfield, almost eighteen, found herself torn between two delightful invitations in London. One was for a musicale at Mrs. Hastings', while the other was for a picture exhibition at the New Gallery. The Fairfields, staying at the Savoy Hotel, were relishing the London season. While Nan and Mr. Fairfield attended dinners and grand events, Patty enjoyed garden parties and teas. She explored on her own, visiting Westminster Abbey and the National Gallery, or with Nan, her father, or friends. Their circle of acquaintances grew, leading to a flood of invitations. Patty embraced each experience, from visiting Windsor Castle to simple afternoon teas. She chuckled at the Londoners' misconceptions about American ladies, finding humor in the differences in fashion and customs between the two cultures.|"[""1.

"Pretty Patty loved fashionable clothes and enjoyed shopping on Bond Street. Initially, Nan supervised her purchases, but Patty's excellent taste led to Nan seeking her advice more often.

The gardener continued his work while the other two remained quiet. Patty faced a challenging situation, hindered by a silly document keeping her from explaining.
