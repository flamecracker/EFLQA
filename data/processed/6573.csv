Nort Shannon rode Blaze, his pony, skillfully into the herd of cattle at Diamond X ranch for the spring round-up. With a gentle touch, Nort guided Blaze towards a bawling calf he needed to cut out for branding. Blaze, understanding his master's command, swiftly snaked out the calf. Nort expertly maneuvered the calf to the corral where it was held for branding. Mr. Merkel, the ranch owner, supervised the process as the hot branding iron marked the calf with the distinct X inside a diamond, signifying ownership. The scene was part of the busy spring round-up at the ranch, where cattle were tallied, inspected, and branded before being shipped out. This essential task ensures that each calf bears its owner's mark, a tradition in the ranching world.|['1.

"Unbranded young cattle that had grown a bit were known as ""mavericks."" When different herds mixed, the mavericks were usually divided since it was hard to tell who they belonged to. The term ""maverick"" originated from a stockman named Maverick, who claimed all unbranded calves in a herd. Mr. Merkel owned several ranches, including Square M, Triangle B, and Diamond X. Bud, along with his cousins Norton and Richard Shannon, helped tally the cattle and brand the unmarked ones at Diamond X. A dispute over maverick ownership between Diamond X and Double Z had been settled in favor of Diamond X. The cowboys worked hard branding and shipping the cattle. The boy ranchers rode back to their camp, which was made up of tents in Happy Valley. As they rode, they noticed someone near the tunnel entrance and decided to investigate."|['1.

Bud Merkel, along with his cousins Nort and Dick Shannon, rode their horses up a steep trail from the reservoir to the top of the mountain. A large iron pipe, resembling a serpent's head, carried water from the distant Pocut River to the valley where they raised cattle. Dick noted that all the cattle had been moved to Diamond X, but some would return to fatten up for the spring tally. As they rode towards Snake Mountain, the narrator introduced the boy ranchers formally. Bud, a western boy, lived at Diamond X with his family. Nort and Dick, his cousins from the east, had adapted well to ranch life. In the previous volumes, they solved mysteries at Diamond X and helped bring water to Buffalo Wallow, allowing them to raise cattle. Bud's father gave him the valley ranch, with Nort and Dick as his partners. The story involves water fights, mysteries, and hidden passages in the tunnel under the mountain.|"[""1.

"He stopped speaking suddenly and leaned over in his saddle to look intently at something on the ground. It was shiny and caught the moonlight, visible to Nort and Dick. ""What's that?"" asked Dick. Nort and Dick dismounted, rushing to their cousin's side. They peered over his shoulder as he examined the strange object he had found near the entrance to the mysterious tunnel. The object, a shiny instrument, had two rubber tubes merging into one, each ending in a metal disk. Bud, dangling it in front of them, speculated it might be part of Yellin' Kid's flute. Nort explained it was a binaural stethoscope for listening to heartbeats or lungs. Bud wondered why it was there, suggesting the local vet might have dropped it.

Bud recounted how Del Pinzo and Hank Fisher had enough influence to release someone from jail early for infecting their livestock. Del Pinzo, a troublesome Mexican half-breed, and Hank Fisher, the owner of Double Z ranch, were known to cause problems for the boy ranchers. Pocut Pete was suspected to be working with them.

There was a telephone system connecting Bud's camp with his father's main ranch and two branch ones, also linked to long distance. However, poles in Happy Valley were blown down by a recent wind, disrupting Bud's line. This prevented communication with Diamond X. The poles were fixed, and cowboys returned to care for the cattle. Despite efforts, the robbers who stole $500 from Mr. Merkel's safe remained elusive. Scratches on the safe indicated a burglary attempt. Bud suspected the burglar planned to blow it open. The situation at Diamond X returned to normal after the failed search for more clues.|"[""1.

Summer approached, bringing its heat, but Bud was relieved that the water supply from the Pocut River to Happy Valley would remain uninterrupted. At Diamond X Second, the boy ranchers prepared their animals for sale in the fall after fattening them on Johnson grass. Alongside Bud, Nort, and Dick, were Buck Tooth, Yellin' Kid, and Snake Purdee, experienced cow punchers. Despite the recent robbery at Diamond X, the ranch settled back into routine.

Bud walked to a marked-off spot and aimed his heavy revolver at a bottle on a stick. He hit the mark perfectly, shattering the bottle with a sharp crack. Nort took his turn but struggled to break the bottle in three shots. Suddenly, a mysterious shot rang out from the darkening valley, prompting the boys to take cover. Bud suspected it wasn't a prank and warned his friends to duck for safety. As they scanned the valley for the source of the shot, they saw no signs of anyone. Bud decided to retaliate if there was another shot. Despite the tension, their Indian companion Buck Tooth remained focused on his evening tasks at camp.

The boys were puzzled by the mysterious shot that had rung out in the distance. Bud and his cousins, Nort and Dick, discussed the possible scenarios.

Yellin' Kid shared that they discovered the remains of a few branding fires and a broken handle of a branding iron with no markings. Additionally, they found a steer that had been killed and its brand blurred to hide its origin. Blurring a brand is a deceptive tactic used by rustlers to claim stolen cattle. The group suspected that the rustlers might have blurred the brands on the rest of the cattle and driven them off, possibly to Double Z ranch. Snake and Yellin' Kid expressed their determination to recover the stolen cattle and deal with the rustlers, including the Mexican half-breed Del Pinzo. Bud, the ranch owner, shared that there were signs of shooting the previous night, hinting at a possible connection to the rustler activity.

Bud spoke in colorful western slang, suggesting they delay dealing with the troublemaker to address the rustler issue first. The boys rode to where the raid was seen, stopping for food and water from concrete troughs fed by reservoir pipes. Nort pointed out the trail left by the rustlers, leading down the valley to a pass where it disappeared. Bud, Nort, and Dick abandoned the trail to investigate a grass fire, suspecting it was accidental due to the dry grass. They rode towards the fire, worried it might scare nearby cattle into a stampede. The dry grass burning was unsuitable for cattle feed, needing to be cut green for hay.|['1.

The sound of galloping horses suddenly stopped. Bud, Nort, and Dick, the boy ranchers, were startled awake by a rider on a tired horse looming over them. It was Four Eyes, a cow puncher who had lost his horse while trying to trail it. The boys noticed he was riding one of their spare ponies. Four Eyes seemed unconcerned about losing his horse. The boys and Four Eyes discussed the missing horse and the possibility of rustlers in the area. As morning arrived, they found no sign of the fire that had burned through the night. Four Eyes decided to head back to camp, leaving the boys to continue tracking the rustlers who had stolen their cattle. The trail abruptly ended in a rocky defile, perplexing the boys.|"['1.

Nort and Bud, along with their friend Dick, were puzzled by the rustlers' trail that seemed to vanish at the bottom of a rocky slope. Determined to catch the rustlers, Dick suggested building a watchtower made of logs on the hillside near their camp. The idea was to have a high vantage point to survey the area and spot any suspicious activity. Excited by the plan, they quickly got to work with the cowboys constructing the tower. Despite their efforts, a cattle raid still occurred after the tower was built.

"As Old Billee mentioned, a more seasoned rancher might have tolerated some losses for peace. However, Bud, like many boys his age, was impulsive. He feared that even losing a few steers could lead to failure for him and his cousins, who were just starting in the ranching business.

After Bud Merkel hung up the phone, he and his cousins got busy preparing for a challenging task. They were determined to handle the situation well.

Bud, along with the boy ranchers and cowboys from Happy Valley, were on the trail of rustlers. As they rode cautiously through the defile, Bud and Yellin' Kid noticed wisps of white vapor ahead. Yellin' Kid, in his excitement, danced around the pillar of vapor, revealing it to be steam from a boiling spring, not smoke from a fire. This discovery surprised Bud, who watched in amazement as Yellin' Kid warned about the hot spring. The group split into smaller parties to prevent any surprises from the rustlers. Bud, in the advance guard, remained alert, ready to warn the others of any danger. The mysterious steam from the boiling spring added a new twist to their pursuit of the rustlers, keeping them on high alert in the rugged terrain.|"[""1.

Bud and his brother, Kid, stumbled upon a scalding hot spring while on their adventure. The steam rising from the spring fooled Kid into dipping his hand into the boiling water. Suddenly, they were startled by the sight of two guns pointed at them. Bud, trying to defuse the situation, jokingly mentioned Davy Crockett. The boys marveled at the bubbling hot spring, resembling a kettle over a fire. Bud explained that such springs don't necessarily need volcanoes but may be fueled by underground fires. The cowboy shared his knowledge of boiling springs in other regions. The boys joked about boiling eggs in the spring, finding the phenomenon intriguing.

Bud surveyed the desolate landscape, devoid of life except for a bubbling spring. The rocky pass offered no solace, with only barren rocks and shale as far as the eye could see. The group decided to move on, fueled by both curiosity and hunger. As they traveled, the terrain gradually transitioned into a more hospitable environment with grass for the animals. Despite their efforts, the trail of the missing cattle led to a dead end, leaving the group perplexed. Snake Purdee's fear of reptiles was teased by the others, adding a light-hearted moment to the tension. Bud's observation that the cattle seemed to have vanished at that point left everyone puzzled, as if they had disappeared into thin air.|"['1.

Yellin' Kid made a sudden declaration as he noticed a hidden side passage. He vanished from his companions' sight but reappeared just as quickly, explaining about a crack in the rock leading to the mysterious trail. The group investigated and found a traverse defile branching off from the main one. As they rode along, the narrow path widened, revealing space for three riders. Dick, in the lead, discovered something astonishing around a turn in the new trail. His loud shout brought everyone to his side. They had stumbled upon the hiding place of a band of rascals, including a lawless Mexican half-breed and his followers. The group decided to hold back, realizing the danger of rushing in and falling into a trap set by the outlaws.

Bud, a cheerful boy rancher, suggested taking an easier trail back to favor their ponies. The care they showed their animals was essential in the West where a man's horse meant comfort and even survival. The horses were trusted companions to cowboys and prospectors. As they rode back, the group was quiet after the attack. Suddenly, Dick disappeared around a rock ledge, and they found him and his horse at the bottom of a slope, luckily unharmed. It was a close call, as the slope could have been dangerous. Despite a mistaken sighting, they continued their journey, reaching a spring with grass and water for their tired horses.

Slim suggested that the missing cattle might have been driven down a side passage or gorge, similar to where Del Pinzo was found, or they might have been backtracked and driven off the open area the same night they were taken. A back trail is when an animal or human retraces their steps. This can deceive pursuers, especially if the tracks are light, like a fox's tracks. In the case of cattle, it would be hard to tell if they were turned back over the same path. The posse set watches that night, and the boy ranchers were on edge. Dick even fired at a coyote, causing a commotion. The next morning, Bud made a discovery on a rocky hillside, revealing a crevice where the missing cattle were hidden, like in a football stadium without seats. Everyone was amazed at the find.|['1.

In a vast natural amphitheater, nestled like a great bowl with sloping green sides and a pool of sparkling water at its center, the missing cattle from Happy Valley were discovered. The entire herd that had been driven away was found contentedly grazing and drinking in this immense crater, much larger than any seen at Yale or Harvard. The cowboys marveled at the sight through a crack in the rock walls, realizing it was an extinct volcano filled with grass and water, forming a perfect corral for the cattle. The foreman deduced that the cattle were herded in and the entrance was cleverly concealed by sliding dirt and rocks back into place. With the help of field glasses, they found where the cattle could be safely guided out.|['1.

Bud and the cowboys discovered the trail of stolen steers leading to the crater wall. Determined to beat the rustlers, they began digging with sticks to clear the entrance blocked with rocks and dirt. Soon, they entered the extinct volcano's crater, where the rustlers had hidden the cattle. The vast corral, covered in rich grass and with a water spring, was a perfect hideout. As they rode in, they spotted Del Pinzo's gang. Both sides armed, Bud fired a warning shot, hoping to intimidate the rustlers. The showdown began as they raced to prevent the cattle from being taken.

The boy ranchers and their friends faced a formidable foe as they ventured into a vast volcanic bowl. The rustlers, outnumbering them two to one, engaged in a wild initial exchange of gunfire. The clashing forces closed in, with the Happy Valley steers caught in between. To clarify the scene, the boy ranchers approached from the north, while the rustlers emerged from the south. The rustlers aimed to drive the cattle away, prompting a fierce confrontation. Despite being outnumbered, the boy ranchers, driven by justice, prepared to defend their livestock. In the midst of the chaos, Dick sustained a serious injury but remained determined, adapting to shoot with his left hand.

At this moment, the battle took a new turn. The Greasers charged swiftly, aiming to corner Bud and his group. However, Bud's crew managed to reach the safety of the rocks first. Positioned strategically behind the rocks, they had the upper hand, shielded from enemy fire. Even though outnumbered, the boy ranchers held their ground, using the rocks as cover to return fire. The Greasers, armed with rifles, posed a greater threat despite their poor marksmanship. Bud's team found themselves in a siege, exchanging shots with the enemy. Meanwhile, Snake and Kid faced their own challenges, retreating to regroup with Slim's forces. Observing the enemy reinforcements, Dick devised a plan. Inspired by a story he knew, he suggested a daring move to outwit the Greasers and turn the tide of the battle.|"[""1.

While some rustlers held Bud and his group back, others fought Slim and his cowboys, and a few herded the cattle towards an opening in an old volcano bowl. Dick suggested a plan to scare off the rustlers besieging Bud by cross-firing with his brother to create a diversion. Bud tended to a wounded cowboy as Dick and Nort sneaked away to execute their daring plan unnoticed. The lull in the fighting allowed them to move undetected. Positioned in a gully, they prepared for a trick to deceive the enemy. Despite Dick's injured hand, they readied their guns and began firing, causing the Greasers to turn in surprise. The tide of battle shifted when Bud and his friends joined in the fight, only to realize that United States troopers were also on the scene, changing the course of events.|"['1.

A bugle's notes signaled the turning tide of battle in favor of the boy ranchers. United States regulars, unmatched in dash and vim, joined the fight. Carbines barked as the troopers and cowboys entered the fray. The Greasers were trapped, with only a few managing to escape. The boy ranchers' cattle were saved, and the rustlers captured. Despite casualties, the enemy suffered greater losses. Lieutenant Wayne, on scout duty, played a crucial role in the capture. He had been posing as a cowboy to gather information, eventually leading to the successful roundup of the gang. The troopers had been tracking the outlaws for some time, and Lieutenant Wayne's efforts as a decoy helped secure the victory.|"[""1.

"""We knew they had made a big raid at your place, but we didn't know where they had hidden the cattle until I happened to think of this old crater, which I discovered one day when I was working for you, Bud.
