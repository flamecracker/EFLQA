"Child! child! you set one crazy! It was flesh and blood, a woman with a blanket around her and a large bundle in her arms. I did not enter the palisade that night. I had grown fond of Madame and the children, and it was difficult to be pushed out without a home and no one to care for me. There is affection in the blood of the Native Americans.""

""I thought it was a poor soul who had lost her husband, and she came close to me, so close that I could hear the beads and shells on her leggings making a soft sound. But I couldn't understand what she was saying. When I tried to get up, she pushed me back with her knee and placed something heavy in my lap. I screamed, fearing it might be an evil spirit. But she pressed it down with her hands, and the child woke up and cried, wrapping its arms around my neck, while the woman quickly disappeared. I tried to calm the sobbing child, who almost choked me with her gentle arms.""

""I felt enchanted. I didn't know what to do, but the poor, trembling child was alive, though I couldn't tell if you were human or not, as there are strange shapes that come at night, and once they grab hold of you--""

Jeanne stood tall, catching Marsac's eye with her newfound grace and beauty. The English influence in Detroit transformed the bustling Detroit River into a hub of activity.

In the olden days, houses were made of different materials like plastered cedar, split trees, and birch bark. The chimneys were a new addition, with seats by the fire in winter. The streets looked gloomy as shutters were closed at dusk. Inside the homes, there was warmth and comfort, with wooden benches and chairs. The living rooms were decorated with Queen's ware, silver, and pewter. Families gathered around a large table. Farms stretched down the river and westward. Detroit had seen many changes, from being an important post during the Revolution to a bloodless capture. General Wayne's victories led to the Chippewa nation giving up claims to Detroit and Mackinaw. The town was in turmoil as people prepared to leave. Jeanne was excited about the changes ahead.|"['1.

In his travels through the eastern part of the now United Colonies, he had never seen a more beautiful sight. It warmed his old heart and he found a most attentive listener. However, the glory of the wood and fields soon faded. The leaves were blown off the trees, leaving them bare and ghostly. The howls of foxes and wolves, the rustle of deer, and the slow tread of bears signaled the approach of winter. New defenses were set up, and skins were used for warmth. Winter garments were brought out, and the town transformed with curtains and hides. Despite the changes, there was still good cheer. Celebrations, dances, and gatherings continued. Snow brought days of fun with snowball fights and sledding. Evenings were filled with stories of the past and tales of bravery. The town of Detroit remained largely unchanged, with a mix of social life and historical reflections.|['1.

Jeanne pondered what they could want from her. Perhaps a ransom, she had heard such stories, although prisoners were usually released after battles. She was unsure of their direction, the surroundings unfamiliar despite her travels around Detroit. The path grew narrow, lined with dark trees, occasional white beech trees gleaming eerily.

The lake roared like a stampede of bisons, waves crashed against the ship with relentless force, and the harbor was enveloped in chaos.

Sometimes, Jeanne felt haunted by the loneliness of her mother. She wondered about the dreary life that had taken away her mother's youth and replaced it with stern lines on her face.

"Jeanne found herself in a strangely quiet Detroit, even with friends around. Everyone was eager to help her, and the young men showed great respect.

The town was bustling with activity, the governor's house and military squares being worked on. Streets were tidied up, buildings painted, and shops displayed their goods.

Pani slowly regained consciousness as the crowd dispersed to the fields and farms, leaving behind a devastated Old Detroit. The flames had spared the Fort, but the town was reduced to ashes. Jacques Giradin, the chief baker, baked bread for the hungry, a few buildings and chimneys remained standing amidst the ruins. The survivors, including Jeanne, faced poverty and uncertainty. Pani, weakened by the ordeal, peacefully passed away with Jeanne by her side. The town began to rebuild, with temporary shelters erected, but the loss was profound.

"""I have news for you, too,"" he said to Jeanne, ""partly sorrowful, partly consoling as well. Two days after reaching her convent home, your mother passed quietly away and was found in the morning by one of the sisters. The poor, anxious soul is at peace. I cannot believe God means one to be so troubled when a sin is forgiven, especially one that has been a mistake. So, little one, if thou hadst listened to her pleadings thou wouldst have been left in a strange land with no dear friend. It is best this way. The poor Indian woman was nearer a mother to thee.""

Jeanne took Monsieur around to the old haunts: the beautiful woods, the stream running over the rocky hillside, the flowers in bloom that had been so fateful to her, the nooks and groves, the green where they put up the Maypole, and her brave old oak, with its great spreading branches and wide leaves, nodding a welcome always. 

One day they went down to the King's wharf to watch a vessel coming up the beautiful river. The sun made it a sea of molten gold today, the air was clear and exhilarating.
