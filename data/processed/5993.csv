"""Here's a letter for you, Doctor Mack,"" said the housekeeper, as she entered the plain room used as a library and sitting-room by her employer, Doctor Ezekiel Mack. ""It's from Walter, I surmise."" This was a favorite word with Miss Nancy Sprague, who, though a housekeeper, prided herself on having been a schoolmistress in her earlier days.

Doctor Mack adjusted his spectacles, for he was rising sixty, and his eyes required assistance, and opened the letter. As he read it his forehead contracted, and he looked disturbed. A perusal of the letter may help us to understand why. It ran as follows:

""DEAR GUARDIAN: You will be surprised at hearing from me so soon again, but I am really forced to write. I find college life much more expensive than I supposed it would be. A fellow is expected to join two or three societies, and each costs money. I know you wouldn't have me appear mean. Then the students have been asked to contribute to a fund for the enlargement of the library, and almost every day there is a demand for money for one object or another. As it is nearly the end of the term, I calculate that with a check for an extra hundred dollars I can get along. I am awfully sorry to ask for it, but it will come out of the money father left me, and I am sure he would wish me to keep up appearances, and not"|"[""Question 1: What is the main reason Doctor Mack looks disturbed after reading the letter?\nA) He is surprised by the content of the letter\nB) He is angry at Walter for asking for money\nC) He is worried about Walter's college expenses\nD) He is disappointed in Miss Nancy Sprague\nE) He is happy to hear from Walter so soon"", 'Question 2: What does Miss Nancy Sprague pride herself on?\nA) Being a housekeeper\nB) Having been a schoolmistress\nC) Knowing Doctor Mack well\nD) Being a good letter writer\nE) Having a plain room', 'Question 3: Why does Walter write to Doctor Mack?\nA) To share good news\nB) To ask for advice\nC) To ask for money\nD) To invite him to visit\nE) To discuss college life', ""Question 4: How does Doctor Mack's age affect his reading of the letter?\nA) He needs assistance from his spectacles\nB) He reads quickly and confidently\nC) He becomes emotional\nD) He ignores the letter\nE) He asks Miss Nancy for help"", ""Question 5: What is the tone of Walter's letter to Doctor Mack?\nA) Apologetic\nB) Excited\nC) Angry\nD) Sad\nE) Indifferent"", 'Question 6: What is the relationship between Doctor Mack and Walter?\nA) Father and son\nB) Guardian and ward\nC) Teacher and student\nD) Colleagues\nE) Friends']"|"[""C) He is worried about Walter's college expenses"", 'B) Having been a schoolmistress', 'C) To ask for money', 'A) He needs assistance from his spectacles', 'A) Apologetic', 'B) Guardian and ward']"
Doctor Mack pondered about Walter's well-being. He decided to visit Euclid College secretly to check on him. Walter was a sophomore at Euclid College, but the real name was concealed to avoid any negative perceptions. The doctor packed his bag with essentials and some cookies for the journey. Upon arrival at the Euclid Hotel near the college, he refrained from informing Walter to observe him discreetly. The hotel thrived due to student visitors and parental patronage. Doctor Mack refrained from openly visiting Walter to assess his conduct independently. Despite his fondness for Walter, he prioritized observing from a distance to ascertain his ward's behavior without influence.|"['1.

Shortly before the students' expected arrival, Doctor Mack secluded himself in his room, ensuring the transom was open. He had learned from a young man that supper was set for twelve, costing two dollars and a half per plate, to be paid by Walter Sherwood. Doctor Mack pondered the change in Walter, from a determined scholar to a carefree individual. Concerned about Walter's behavior, Doctor Mack wondered how to guide him. Addressing the gathering, Doctor Mack welcomed them to the feast, emphasizing the importance of enjoying life. Walter, in jest, mentioned the absence of professors due to their dedication to studies.

At the ancient Euclid school, students had a unique way to banish worries by singing together. They believed it was okay to play pranks on new students to lighten the mood. Dr. Mack, reminiscing about his college days, refrained from joining in the fun, understanding the importance of balancing enjoyment with academic diligence.

If the blow had landed, this tale might never have been told. Walter's sharp eyes anticipated the attack. Swiftly dodging, he struck the giant's arm with the poker. The tramp howled in pain, clutching his injured arm. Walter, composed, instructed Mrs. Gregory to leave. With the table as a barrier, he outsmarted his foe, taking advantage of the weakened arm. Seizing the moment, he broke free and fled outside. Just in time, a towering young man named Hiram Nutt arrived. Hiram swiftly subdued the tramp, who demanded money. Mrs. Gregory entrusted the money to Hiram for safekeeping. The tramp was swiftly bound and escorted to the lock-up. Grateful, Mrs. Gregory invited Hiram for supper and offered him a place to stay for the night.|"[""1.

Walter accepted an invitation from Mrs. Gregory and had a delightful supper, a stark contrast to the meals at his boarding house. Mrs. Canfield's cooking left much to be desired, with strong butter and weak tea. Walter enjoyed the meal and Mrs. Gregory was pleased. Later, he discussed insurance with Mr. Gregory, finding him attentive. The next day, Walter assisted in the conviction of a tramp named Barney Fogg. Despite early success as an insurance agent, Walter faced challenges due to his youth. He decided to resign and seek a stable job. With only $46 left, he worried about his finances.

An advertisement for the business Locke & Green didn't reveal much about their operations, but Walter wasn't too concerned. His focus was on the $15 weekly salary he needed. Upon entering the small room, he found Mr. Locke engrossed in writing in a large book. Mr. Locke showed Walter accounts of successful agents like B. Schenck and G. Parker, who had remitted hundreds of dollars. Mr. Locke then left, instructing Walter to inform any agents that he would return at one o'clock. Walter, content with the $30 deposit he had given, hoped to prove his worth. With his weekly salary, he aimed to live comfortably and save money without relying on his guardian.

Walter pondered, realizing his new job was with a successful firm. His duties were light, and he felt fortunate for the opportunity. He wondered why Mr. Locke hadn't asked for references but then figured the deposit served as a substitute. Walter also considered his appearance might have impressed his employer. Despite his doubts, he tried to trust Mr. Locke, emphasizing positive feedback from agents. As the day ended, he left the office, uncertain about his situation. He decided to wait before sharing the news with his guardian. Despite having a check, he worried it might be a scam. With little money left, he hesitated to ask for more.
