As the rain poured down steadily, two boys sought shelter under a hemlock tree. Moving through the bushes, Sam accidentally hit Tom's face with a branch.

In the dark cave, the youths armed themselves with torches, cautiously navigating to avoid pitfalls. They stumbled upon a narrow opening leading down the mountainside. The eldest Rover connected the dots, realizing they were in the presence of freight thieves. Hidden, they observed three men by an automobile discussing unlawful deeds involving their uncle's traction bonds. The boys overheard plans to deceive their uncle and steal from him.

Tom suggested they search for Dangler, but during the pursuit, he stumbled over a log and fell into the bushes. Exhausted and frustrated, they decided to heed Sam's advice and head back home. The three boys were far from the farm, needing to cross the river above the falls, adding more distance to their journey. Despite the muddy conditions, they managed to reach the farm with the help of a speedy horse. Mrs. Rover welcomed them warmly, urging them to change into dry clothes and offering hot tea. Concerned about the unregistered bonds, they quickly prepared to warn Uncle Randolph. As they set off in a buckboard, they encountered Alexander Pop, a former worker from Putnam Hall.

Dick struggled to control the team as they raced ahead, full of energy from days of rest. Tom warned of impending danger, and soon enough, Sam was thrown off the buckboard as the horses charged on. Eventually, Dan and his mate veered off the road into a field, slowing down as the soft soil made it harder to pull. Once the horses calmed down, the boys continued their journey, now illuminated by a lantern due to the dark. As they moved on, they spotted tire tracks of an automobile on a side road, hinting at recent visitors. Randolph Rover shared his distress over counterfeit bonds, reassured by Mr. Jardell's promise to replace them.

Tom expressed his frustration by wanting to confront the swindlers, Merrick and Pike. His uncle, Randolph Rover, shared his disappointment at how easily their relative fell for the scam. They headed to the telephone company's central office, dealing with the aftermath of the broken wires. They called Andrew D. Jardell's residence, learning that he wasn't involved. The boys suggested alerting authorities to catch the culprits. Messages were sent out, but the swindlers remained at large. The Rovers split up, with Tom and Dick staying at the Carwell hotel. Despite efforts, the swindlers were still on the run. The next day, they received a message about the swindlers passing through a village.

When they reached the farm, they discovered that their uncle had sent a detailed letter to the traction company officers about what had happened. In response, the company decided to hire a private detective to investigate. Despite this, weeks passed with no sign of Merrick and Pike or the missing bonds. One day, Dick urged the team onward, with the eldest Rover brother keeping them in check. The weather was perfect as they arrived at the cave. Inside, they found everything gone, likely taken by previous visitors. Undeterred, they explored the cave with their electric pocket lights. Suddenly, they were bombarded with dirt and stones from above. With quick thinking, they sought refuge in the cave.

Arriving at the top of the hole where dirt and stones were thrown, they looked around with interest. Soft soil showed large footprints, bigger than theirs. The box was empty, disappointing Dick. He found bits of old and new paper with undecipherable writing. They picked up the paper for later examination and followed a trail to a clearing with a sparkling spring. Suddenly, Tom spotted Dangler with a bundle running. They searched the deserted cabin finding scattered remains of a meal. Following the trail, they reached a mountain road losing track of Dangler. Returning to the cabin, they found old clothes and newspapers. They informed the authorities and left for the farm. Reflecting on his past, Dick shared his current success as a traveling salesman, giving up bad habits and feeling hopeful for the future.|['1.

The boys' luggage was sent ahead, so they only carried their dress-suit cases. Their father drove them to Oak Run station, where family and farm folks bid them farewell. Putnam Hall near Cedarville on Cayuga Lake was their destination, reached by train to Ithaca and a lake steamer. A delay awaited them due to the steamboat breakdown. The boys checked their cases and explored the city, finding a wild west show. In the crowd, they spotted Merrick, who fled. The Rover boys chased him through alleys and buildings until he descended a fire escape, evading capture.|"[""1.

Tom called out to Merrick, but he knew it was a futile command. Merrick glanced up at the sound of Tom's voice, muttered incomprehensibly, then swiftly descended the fire escape. Tom, determined, followed suit, mimicking Merrick's actions. As Tom reached the second landing, Merrick vanished around a corner and onto the street. Despite their efforts, Merrick eluded them. Tom compensated the tenement men, and they informed the police. With no other leads, the Rover boys headed to the steamboat dock, sending a message to Randolph Rover. On the boat, they reminisced about familiar sights along the lake. Approaching Putnam Hall, a military academy, they encountered cadets, sparking excitement for the upcoming days.

Sam, Tom, and Dick were now in the same grade at Putnam Hall. Sam had worked hard the previous term and caught up to Tom. On the other hand, Dick fell behind due to being away for his father's business. Since it was their last term, the Rovers focused on their studies and avoided fooling around in class. Despite Tom's occasional urge to play pranks, a look from Dick made him refocus on his books. During football season, they played on Larry Colby's team, while Tad Sobber led another team with Nick Pell as quarterback. Sobber's captaincy puzzled many. A quarrel between Tom and Sobber led to a comical mishap with a waiter carrying food to sick students. The boys couldn't help but laugh at the scene.|"[""1.

Dick spoke the truth to Mr. Strong, explaining that Tom's actions were justified. Mr. Strong hesitated, knowing the Rover boys were usually right and recalling Tad Sobber's recent dishonesty. Tad was punished with solitary confinement for his impudence, which angered him. Tad vowed revenge on Tom and Dick. Pell warned Tad to be cautious, mentioning past conflicts with Dan Baxter and Lew Flapp. Unfazed, Tad planned to outsmart the Rover boys. The boys, anticipating trouble, remained vigilant.

After a heated argument over unpaid cream, the storekeeper's anger led to a chase after the cadets from Putnam Hall. Meanwhile, Tad Sobber and Nick Pell were spotted around the village. The boys planned a secret feast in their dormitory, unaware that Nick Pell overheard their arrangements. Determined to play a prank, Nick made a trip to Cedarville and visited a failing museum. As the feast began, the boys enjoyed chicken sandwiches, cake, and lemonade, with ice-cream chilling nearby. Despite a distracted hall monitor, the boys indulged in their clandestine gathering.

With caution, he approached the hall door and opened it. A dim light was burning, making it hard to see. He found a white object on the floor, a pasteboard box tied with a strong string. As he picked it up, a snake emerged from the box and hissed at the boys. Startled, the eldest, Dick, dropped the box, and the snake slithered under a bed. In a panic, one boy climbed a stand, causing it to crash down on the snake. The commotion woke up the school, and the snake darted around, causing chaos. The boys, fearing the snake, climbed on furniture. The first assistant teacher, thinking it was a prank, opened the door, and the snake almost bit him. The snake escaped, causing a frenzy in the school. Despite a search, the snake was not found, leading to a mix of fear and laughter among the boys.|['1.

"""He must have gone downstairs,"" said Dick, and then a hunt was made below. Some windows were open for air, and Captain Putnam thought the snake might have escaped that way. He believed the snake was harmless and wanted to calm the timid students. The school took an hour to settle down. Many were scared to sleep, fearing the snake. The Rovers and friends discussed quietly and cleaned up the interrupted feast. Fred was serious, worried about the snake crawling on someone. The search continued the next day but found nothing. Some thought it was a joke and laughed. Strong hoped the snake would be killed. The boys secretly moved the snake to the bully's room, causing chaos.

In the classroom that afternoon, history recitations were interrupted by a sudden shriek as Nick Pell leaped from his seat and fled from his desk, startled by a snake. The boys reacted differently, some believing it was real, others suspecting a trick. The teacher cautiously approached the desk armed with a ruler, only to have the snake hiss and strike. Tom threw a book, hitting the snake, and chaos ensued as the boys hurled objects until the snake was cornered. Dick finally subdued it with a geography book. Meanwhile, Nick collapsed, prompting urgent calls for medical help. Doctor Fremley arrived and attended to Nick, leaving with a grave expression. Dick then confessed the events leading up to the snake incident, implicating Tad Sobber. The discovery of Sobber's compositions added to the mystery, causing him to flee the school.|"[""1.

After the interview, Captain Putnam sent for Tad Sobber, but he couldn't be found. Peleg Snuggers searched for him and discovered that Sobber had left for Cedarville. Sobber had given a note to one of the cadets. Days passed, and Nick Pell remained weak and out of his mind. He revealed that Sobber had bought a sick snake and hoped it would bite one of the Rovers. Nick mentioned how Sobber forced him to keep quiet about it. Nick was moved to a quiet house for his recovery. The Rover boys decided to stay at Putnam Hall for Thanksgiving, preparing for a party at the Stanhope cottage. They arrived at the well-lit cottage, greeted by Dora, Nellie, Grace, and other friends.

The group gathered at the swamp's edge, examining the hat found in the mud. A match flickered, casting a faint glow on the pool, revealing no sign of the missing man. Mr. Laning and the students circled the swamp cautiously, then returned to the road, hanging the hat on a tree as a marker. The mood dampened by Merrick's disappearance, they headed back to school. The next day, Dick sought permission to investigate further. With Mr. Laning, they searched the swamp area but found no trace. Returning to the cottage, they were greeted with a warm meal. Plans were made to contact local authorities, but Merrick remained elusive. Amidst the snowfall, the students enjoyed a snowball fight, watched by Captain Putnam and George Strong.|"['1.

One winter at West Point, a grand snowball fight took place, lasting for hours. The captain shared tales of the intense battle where they fought fiercely and emerged victorious. To honor him, the cadets made a statue, though comically inaccurate. The fun continued as the boys coasted down a hill on their sleds, with the Rovers competing against Peter Slade. Despite falling behind, the Rovers' bob surged ahead, thrilling the spectators. Meanwhile, other cadets rolled gigantic snowballs down a hill, creating a massive one with a hollow center. A mischievous plan unfolded as they tricked the utility man, Snuggers, by pushing the snowball with him inside down the hill.|"['1.

"Down the steep hill rolled the massive snowball, with the students chasing after it. As it tumbled, it grew larger and larger. Suddenly, they spotted Peleg Snuggers poking his head out from one end, spinning like a top. Eventually, the snowball halted in a meadow. The cadets hurried to find Peleg crawling out, looking disoriented. ""I won't be back to this hill again, not for anyone,"" he grumbled before storming off. Threatening to report them to Captain Putnam, he warned against such antics. The boys then headed home for the mid-winter holidays. Along the way, they stopped in Ithaca to buy Christmas gifts, mailing some and keeping others. Arriving home, they were warmly welcomed, and the topic of missing bonds was discussed. The boys enjoyed hunting with Jack Ness, bagging rabbits and squirrels, before heading back through the woods, where they spotted a fox.

During the break between Christmas and New Year, Bill Dangler was taken to the county jail awaiting the grand jury's decision. The search for Merrick, Pike, and others continued unsuccessfully. Soon, the boys resumed their studies, with the Rovers eager to excel. Dick helped Tom and Sam with difficult lessons. Despite missing school, Dick was thrilled to finish his education at Putnam Hall with his brothers. When the snow melted, the boys enjoyed skating on the lake. A thrilling two-mile race ensued, with Peter Slade initially leading until Larry and Dick caught up. In a friendly finish, Dick and Larry crossed the line together, followed closely by Marley and Sandwick.

Sam excitedly pointed out a sheltered cove where they could anchor the sloop. The boys were concerned about rain but were relieved when the snow flurry passed. The wind, however, grew stronger. To stay warm, they set up sailcloth on the deck and huddled together in the cuddy, sharing stories. Despite some doubts, they decided to leave the cove. With only the jib raised, they sailed swiftly. Sam rang a bell at an old house, and the porch collapsed. Peeking through broken windows, they found a dusty interior. In a bedroom, they discovered letters hinting at the previous occupant's sea travels. Moving to the parlor, they found little of interest.
