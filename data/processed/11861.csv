The Edisons relocated to Port Huron, Michigan, residing just outside the town along the St. Clair river, where it emerges from Lake Huron. Their home nestled within an orchard, within walking distance to town. In those days, there was no mandatory school attendance, so young Edison didn't go to school. Instead, his mother, a former teacher, educated him as best she could. Edison spent much time at the public library, eager to absorb knowledge. His father built a tower offering panoramic views of the town, the river, and the lake, charging ten cents for the experience. Although few visitors came, young Edison found solace there to read. Fascinated by electricity, he delved into books about the subject, always thirsting for more information.

The boys, William Brown and Augustus Grier, were not ordinary troublemakers in Fairview, as their classmates confirmed. Despite a past incident involving a cruel youth, Gus stood up against him. When their teacher, Professor Gray, vouched for the boys to Mr. Hooper, their neighbor, the situation eased. Mr. Hooper, a wealthy man with a rough exterior, agreed to let the boys prove themselves. Professor Gray, with a hint of humor, likened the upcoming project to a strategic move. The boys, along with the Professor, embarked on purchasing materials for a power plant, showcasing their capabilities.

On the third morning, the Professor said goodbye to the boys, asking them to keep in touch about their work. They had set up an engineering company with Professor Gray as president, Gus as vice-president, and Bill as general manager. They received funds from the Fairview Bank for their project. Dressed in new clothes, with help from a friendly worker named George, the boys started building a dam. They were so focused on their work that they didn't notice Mr. Hooper and his nephew, Thaddeus, watching from a distance. The boys explained their methods for measuring distances using triangulation and chaining. Despite initial doubts, they invited Mr. Hooper to see their work with a transit later that day.|"['1.

The fat girl, Sophronia Doyle, known as ""Skeets,"" and Grace Hooper helped with the task. Bill and Gus set up the transit and stakes to measure distances and angles accurately.

Mr. Hooper, the wall here is incredibly strong. It could withstand even the force of the ocean behind it unless the stone and cement were crushed by immense pressure. It would take days of hammering or a large amount of blasting powder to make a dent in it. Mr. Hooper's good humor returned, influenced by his nephew's persuasive words.

Thomas A. Edison, a renowned inventor, faced financial struggles upon his arrival in New York City. Despite debts and hunger, his determination led him to a wholesale tea house where he tasted tea for the first time, a simple yet satisfying breakfast. Edison's resourcefulness shone through as he carefully selected apple dumplings and coffee for his next meal, savoring every bite. Seeking employment, he found himself in a telegraph office, eventually impressing Dr. Laws with his quick thinking and problem-solving skills during a chaotic situation with the gold indicators. This led to a remarkable opportunity where Edison was appointed to oversee the entire plant at a generous salary, marking a significant turning point in his career. Through hard work and dedication, Edison's journey from humble beginnings to becoming a prominent figure in the world of innovation serves as an inspiring tale of perseverance and success.|"['1.

During an eventful Black Friday, the stock market witnessed a frenzy. The Gould and Fisk group manipulated gold prices, causing chaos in Wall Street. Amid the madness, Speyer, a key player, needed five men to restrain him. Meanwhile, young inventor Edison's innovation caught the eye of the Gold and Stock Company president. Edison's invention of a machine to print gold quotes revolutionized the industry. His simple ticker system made stock trading easier, even in London. Edison's knack for inventions impressed the company's president, who offered him a contract. Initially nervous about the payment, Edison eventually received a $40,000 check. Bewildered, he took it to the bank, where confusion ensued. With guidance, Edison learned to endorse the check and opened his first bank account, marking a significant milestone in his career.|"['1.
