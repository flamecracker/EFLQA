The gunners on the destroyer aimed precisely at the U-boat as it tried to dive, hitting it with a projectile amidships. An explosion followed, lifting the submarine's stern out of the water before it plunged to the ocean floor. Bubbles and oil marked the tragedy's aftermath. The convoy's vigilance increased, fearing another submarine encounter. Fair Head in Ireland was the first sight of land after leaving America, stirring emotions in those of Irish descent on board. The convoy steered clear of submarines, reaching England warmly welcomed by locals.

"Their journey through the eastern part of France was starkly different from their previous trip across England. In England, they witnessed the preparation for war with occasional signs of its aftermath. However, in France, they encountered the brutal reality of war with entire towns destroyed, forests decimated, and orchards wiped out. As they traveled, they passed ammunition and food trains heading towards the front lines where soldiers from various nations were recovering from the relentless trench warfare.

Approaching the battle zone, they saw the devastation firsthand with towns reduced to rubble and the deafening roar of artillery. Tanks, the colossal war machines, rolled past them towards the front, ready for the impending assault. The lieutenant received urgent orders to establish communication lines near the skirmish points. Despite the dangers ahead, their driver, a seasoned soldier, remained composed, having faced the horrors of war before.

The group of American soldiers cautiously advanced through the dark, silent night in enemy territory. They refrained from using flashlights and had to drop to the ground whenever rockets illuminated the area. Lieutenant Mackinson carefully checked their map in the cover of a thick clump of trees. As they lay still, they heard the enemy scouting party nearby and felt trapped within the crossfire. Despite being discovered, they had to proceed. Suddenly, Tom Rawle got hit but insisted it was minor. The group split up, with some soldiers forging ahead and others lagging behind due to Tom's wound.

A robust device, like giant shears, hoists the mast and umbrella-shaped antenna on the tractor within about eight minutes. The tractor, with a crew, weighs nearly five tons, making its operation on steep mountain roads challenging and unsafe. They carried a portable radio pack-set for emergencies, generating power by hand-cranking. The journey started smoothly but became difficult on the uneven road with steep inclines. They encountered a large truck on a narrow road, forcing them to reverse back. During this maneuver, the tractor's brakes were crucial for stability. Finally, they reached a hidden spot in the woods, set up a cooking area, and prepared for the night. Snowfall covered the ground as they took turns keeping watch for incoming messages.

Finally, after keeping watch, the guard added more wood to the fire and sat down. His rifle lay beside him as he rested his chin in his hands. Soon, he dozed off, only to wake suddenly and move to a shadier spot. Quietly, Jerry crawled back to the camp, taking the guard's gun and moving it near the horses. With a nod, Slim understood the plan. Jerry then took the guard's revolver, waking him without a sound. Slim got armed too, and they had the situation under control. Jerry then collected the other Germans' guns while Slim kept watch. They held all the Germans at gunpoint, leaving them stunned at the sudden turn of events.|"['1.

Slim quietly retrieved his revolver and stowed it away. He then disarmed the other enemy soldier in the same manner. Using his foot, Jerry roused the remaining two men. He instructed two of them to saddle and bridle the horses, pairing them up with the lieutenant and his comrade on one, and two others on a separate horse. The sentry rode alone with rations, while Slim and Jerry each took a horse to carry themselves and the equipment. They swiftly crossed the terrain towards the mountain they had left earlier that day. Under Jerry's command, the Germans set up the pack-set. As they rode down the mountain towards camp, Jerry revealed some captured documents to the officer. The major commended their actions and promoted them to sergeants, hinting at future advancements. Overwhelmed by the news, the trio headed to the mess tent, contemplating how to show gratitude to Mr. Burton.|"['1.
