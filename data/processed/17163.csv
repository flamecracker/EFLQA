The wise stargazers, likely astronomers, followed a star to Jerusalem seeking the King of the Jews. King Herod, fearing a threat to his rule, schemed to find and harm the newborn King. The wise men, guided by the star, found Jesus and offered precious gifts. Meanwhile, shepherds were visited by angels announcing Jesus' birth, filling them with joy. Later, the wise men, avoiding Herod, worshipped Jesus and returned home safely. As Jesus grew, His family journeyed to Jerusalem for Passover, joining many others in the celebration.|"['1.

When Joseph and Mary realized Jesus was missing after a feast, they searched for Him. After three days of searching, they found Jesus in the Temple, discussing with Jewish doctors. His wisdom amazed everyone. Later, Jesus taught by the Lake of Gennesaret. He asked Simon Peter to cast his nets, and they caught so many fish that the nets broke. Simon was astonished and called Jesus Lord. Jesus told Simon he would become a fisher of men. This story teaches us the importance of building our lives on a strong foundation, like the house on solid rock, rather than the one on sand that crumbled in the storm.|"['1.

Jesus gave a lesson to the people about the importance of following His teachings and not just hearing them. He shared a parable about two men, one who built his house on a rock and another on sand. When storms came, the house on the rock stood firm, while the one on sand fell. This story illustrated that those who follow Christ's commandments will endure trials. In another incident, a Centurion asked Jesus to heal his servant. The Centurion displayed great faith, believing that Jesus could heal his servant with just a word. Jesus commended the Centurion for his faith and healed the servant. Additionally, Jesus showed compassion to a sinful woman who anointed His feet with ointment, forgiving her sins and praising her love and respect.|"[""1.

There was a wealthy man who owned vast lands that yielded abundant crops. When it was time to harvest, his barns were too small to store all his produce. So, he decided to tear down his old barns and build bigger ones to hoard all his goods, thinking he could then relax, enjoy life, and be merry. Jesus warns that those who focus on amassing earthly wealth rather than seeking treasures in heaven by serving God will face consequences. Death can come unexpectedly, leaving behind all material possessions. Jesus advises his disciples not to worry about food and clothing, as life is more than just material things. Instead, he encourages seeking the kingdom of God, promising that all necessities will be provided. He emphasizes the importance of storing treasures in heaven through good deeds rather than earthly riches that are temporary.|['1.

In a parable, Jesus explained that good people who follow God's teachings are like seeds planted in good soil, growing strong and bearing good fruit. An enemy sowed bad seeds among the good ones, representing wicked people influenced by evil. At the end of the world, the wicked will be separated from the righteous, just as tares are gathered and burned while wheat is stored in the barn. Jesus compared the Kingdom of God to leaven or yeast, tiny plants that make dough light and spongy by releasing gas bubbles. The people of Canaan historically hid treasures for safety, but many were unable to reclaim them due to conflicts or natural disasters like earthquakes. Consequently, treasure hunters in Canaan diligently search for these hidden riches.|"['1.

In a beautiful painting, we see a man diligently searching for a hidden treasure in a field. After much digging, he uncovers the treasure he sought. Determined to possess it, he sells all his belongings to buy the field and claim the riches. This story mirrors a lesson Jesus taught about the Kingdom of Heaven being a priceless treasure worth sacrificing everything for. Similarly, another tale unfolds by the seashore, where a merchant eagerly seeks a valuable pearl. When offered the pearl in exchange for his gold, he realizes its true worth and decides to sell all he has to acquire it. This story symbolizes the pursuit of God's forgiveness, where one must be willing to let go of sinful or worldly attachments to attain true spiritual riches. Just as fishermen sort through their catch, separating the good from the bad, so too will angels separate the righteous from the wicked in the end times.|"['1.

Once, Jesus spoke to His disciples about the day He would return in glory with angels to judge all nations. He described how the righteous would be welcomed into eternal life while the wicked would be rejected. On another occasion, Jesus and His disciples sailed to the land of the Gadarenes, where they encountered a man possessed by many evil spirits. This man lived among the tombs, tormented and wild. Jesus commanded the spirits to leave him, and they begged to enter a herd of swine nearby. The swine then rushed into the sea and drowned. The man, now healed and in his right mind, wished to follow Jesus, but Jesus instructed him to share the miracle with his community. In Capernaum, a woman with a twelve-year illness believed touching Jesus' garment would heal her, and her faith made her well. Jesus commended her faith and sent her off in peace.|"['1.

Jairus, a synagogue ruler, sought Jesus' help for his dying daughter. Despite hearing she had passed, Jesus reassured Jairus, claiming she was only sleeping.

Once, Jesus boarded a ship seeking rest with His disciples. However, the crowd followed them, leaving no time for even a meal. Jesus landed in a desert place, but the people tracked them down. Overwhelmed by compassion, Jesus healed the sick and spoke to the multitude. As evening approached, the disciples suggested sending the people away to buy food. But Jesus, moved by kindness, instructed the disciples to feed the crowd. With only five loaves and two fishes, Jesus blessed the food, and miraculously, it fed over five thousand men, along with women and children. Even after everyone was satisfied, twelve baskets of leftovers were collected. This act of kindness and abundance showcased Jesus' compassion and power. Later, Jesus walked on water to reach his disciples during a storm, demonstrating his divinity and calming the sea.|['1.

Jesus praised the woman for her strong faith and granted her request to heal her daughter. When she returned home, she found her daughter completely healed. Jesus, knowing her faith, tested it to make it shine brighter. He blessed her, and she must have been overjoyed to find her daughter well. Later, in Capernaum, priests asked Peter if Jesus paid tribute. Jesus, aware of the situation, instructed Peter to find a coin in a fish's mouth to pay the tribute. This act showed Jesus' exemption as the Son of God but avoided offense. The story of the Good Samaritan teaches compassion. A man was left half-dead by thieves. A priest and a Levite passed by, but a Samaritan, despite enmity, helped him, showing kindness and care.|"['1.

"One day, Jesus was asked by His disciples to teach them to pray. So Jesus taught them the prayer we all know well, starting with ""Our Father, who is in Heaven, may Your name be honored."" But Jesus told them praying wasn't enough; they shouldn't give up, even if they didn't get what they asked for right away. They should keep asking until God, in His time and way, granted what He knew was good. Jesus shared a parable to teach this lesson: ""Imagine having a friend who comes at midnight asking for bread because someone arrived and you have nothing to offer. Even if the friend refuses at first, if you persist, he will help."" Jesus then advised His disciples, and us, to ""Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened."" If we ask for what is good, God will provide.

Jesus was teaching a crowd that included tax collectors and sinners. The tax collectors, known as publicans, were often seen as greedy because they collected more taxes than required. The religious leaders, the Scribes and Pharisees, criticized Jesus for associating with sinners. In response, Jesus told them parables about a shepherd who rejoiced over finding a lost sheep, a woman who celebrated finding a lost coin, and a father who welcomed back his wayward son with open arms. The son had squandered his inheritance, realized his mistakes, and returned home to seek forgiveness. The father, overjoyed at his son's return, threw a feast. This story illustrated the importance of forgiveness and repentance. Jesus also healed Peter's mother-in-law and many others, showing compassion and care for the sick and possessed.|"['1.

In a story told by Jesus, a beggar and a rich man passed away. The angels took the beggar to heaven, where he was no longer poor but dressed in splendor. The rich man, however, found himself in torment. From afar, he saw the beggar in comfort with Abraham. The rich man pleaded for relief, but Abraham explained the divide between them. The rich man requested Lazarus to warn his family, but Abraham said they had the teachings of Moses and the prophets. Jesus used this tale to teach his followers about the importance of persistent prayer and faith in God's justice. He also highlighted the contrast between the unjust judge and God's willingness to help His faithful followers. Jesus warned against hypocrisy, emphasizing the importance of true devotion over outward appearances.|"[""1.

In a story told by Jesus, a Pharisee and a Publican went to the Temple to pray. The Pharisee stood in a visible spot and boasted about his good deeds, while the Publican humbly asked for forgiveness for his sins. Jesus explained that the Publican, who showed humility, was more forgiven than the proud Pharisee. He taught that being humble is important and that those who are meek will be rewarded. Jesus also used a fig tree to teach a lesson about the importance of bearing fruit. When the fig tree had no fruit, Jesus caused it to wither to show the consequences of unfruitfulness. He emphasized the power of faith and forgiveness in prayers. Jesus shared a parable about a vineyard owner who sent servants to collect fruit but they were mistreated. Finally, the owner sent his son, who was killed by the wicked laborers.|"['1.

Jesus told a story to the priests and elders about a vineyard owner who sent servants to collect fruits but they were mistreated. The owner then sent his son, who was also rejected and killed. The priests realized the story was about them and were furious. In another parable, a king invited guests to his son's wedding feast, but they refused.

In a story told by Jesus, the bridegroom symbolizes His return to Earth on Judgment Day. The ten virgins represent people, some with hearts full of God's love, keeping their lamps bright by obeying His teachings. Others lack this love and readiness for Christ's return, with lamps that soon dim. A nobleman leaves to become king of a distant land, entrusting his servants with talents based on their abilities. Two servants double their talents through wise investments, while one buries his talent. Upon the nobleman's return, the diligent servants are praised, but the negligent one is rebuked for hiding his talent. This story teaches that we must use our God-given abilities to do good, as we will be held accountable for how we use them.|"['1.

The Pharisees plotted against Jesus, but He evaded them and healed many. Jesus was crucified, but after three days, He rose and spent time with His disciples. He promised them the Holy Spirit's power. As He blessed them, He ascended to heaven, leaving them with a message. Paul and Silas, wrongly imprisoned, prayed and sang, causing an earthquake that freed them. The jailer, fearing punishment, was moved by their faith and asked how to be saved. They told him to believe in Jesus, and he was baptized. The next day, they were released. Jesus, now in heaven, promised to return and bring believers to a glorious home.|"['1.
