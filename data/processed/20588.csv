Health on the island was disrupted when Harry fell ill with a fever. To determine his temperature, they had to make a thermometer using substitutes for glass and mercury. They learned how the Fahrenheit and Centigrade scales were determined. After testing the thermometer, they found Harry had a dangerous fever. Meanwhile, as rains caused the Cataract River to rise, they decided to explore the sea coast to the east. Yoking up the yaks, they gathered plant samples at the beach and followed the shore, where they discovered a boat missing from the South River Falls. Inside, they found strange oars and rope. Harry and George planned to sail the boat to the Cataract River, but the Professor took the team home. While exploring, they sighted an object on the cliffs and went ashore for an examination, finding the wrecked remains of their life-boat. When their boat washed away, they had to retrieve the life-boat and float to the mainland, where they met the Professor for explanations.|"[""1.

"The following educational passage for middle school students has been refined using the given vocabulary:

By midday the following day, Baby started behaving strangely, jumping from side to side in fear. Harry, leading the way, was summoned, and the wagon halted. The commotion seemed like fear. Before Harry could reach the wagon, a shot was heard, and something hit the canvas top and fell. Quickly, the animal leaped onto a yak's back before the Professor, who was driving, comprehended the situation. Harry, alerted by the Professor, spotted the creature in a tree beside the wagon and swiftly fired, hitting its forelegs. The animal tumbled, leaped onto the yak, and was shot by George and the Professor. The wildcat, a natural enemy of orangutans, was skinned, unsettling Baby. The orangutan's fear of the wildcat's pelt and scent lingered. The distinguishing features of the wildcat, such as its larger, flatter head and shorter legs, were discussed. The day ended as they reached a level area, approximately sixty miles west of the Cataract. The mountain ranges to the south were visible, appearing less imposing from a height. The conversation shifted to the sensation of looking down from a height, which was attributed to unfamiliar perspectives. The topic of vertigo and its effects on the nervous system was also touched upon. As they journeyed through the island's tableland, adorned with groves and young trees, they encountered"|"['1.

On the fifth day of their journey, the explorers came across a wide river flowing to the north. By midday, they reached its banks, but the river posed a challenge: it was too broad to cross without a raft. Considering the risk and the distance from home, they decided not to attempt it. This river was larger than the South River they had encountered earlier. The explorers were now taking their time, examining plants, trees, and the geological makeup of the land. The river was estimated to be about seventy miles from their starting point. Further ahead, there was a mountain chain visible in the distance. After spending a day by the river, they decided to move on. Harry's suggestion led them to camp near a small stream that flowed into the West River. The Professor and George made an interesting discovery near the stream, hinting at the presence of different tribes on the island.|"['1.

The following night, after dinner, they gathered in the wagon until late, discussing their future plans. It had been nine months since they left home, and the thought of being considered lost by their loved ones was hard to bear. Did the boys miss home? I don't need to suggest it; the reality was clear. Despite missing their beautiful home, caring family, and the uncertainty of their return, they faced danger and believed more perils awaited them. The Professor, a philosopher, understood the need for activity in the human mind, especially in young individuals. Boys are curious and active, needing direction for their energy. This led to the concept of manual training, where education blends brain and muscle work. Boys thrive when their efforts are purposeful, as seen in their projects like the water wheel, sawmill, and wagon. They found joy and fulfillment in their work, not seeking payment but valuing their accomplishments. The night ended with a daring plan proposed by the Professor, showcasing the importance of direction and purpose in their endeavors.|"['1.

Their quick preparations were evident as they acted promptly. Within minutes, a shot echoed, followed by a sudden darkness. The boys noticed the extinguished lights and hurried back to the Professor. He explained the phenomenon as caused by decaying matter releasing phosphorus gas that appears to burn but doesn't. They decided to take turns keeping watch at night and planned to start early the next day. George took the first watch, followed by Harry. However, Baby's restlessness disrupted their night as he cried loudly, startling them. Despite the tense atmosphere, they remained vigilant, scanning the surroundings every hour and mile, avoiding the river bed to prevent detection by potential enemies. The night passed in fits of sleep, with Harry preparing breakfast while Baby leaped nervously among nearby trees. The camp was on high alert, with the scout emphasizing the importance of keen observation and sound analysis. The next day, they journeyed through dense forests, and as George led the way, he encountered an animal and fired a shot, triggering a series of shots from the river. The group reacted swiftly, ready for any unexpected events.|"['1.

Sound travels at a rate of 1,040 feet per second. I calculated that it took four seconds for Baby's cries to echo back from the hills. This means the sound had to travel to the hills and back, so it would take two seconds each way. The boys and the Professor quickly grabbed their guns to follow the bear. When Harry aimed his gun, the bear was less than a hundred feet away. The shots from the boys and the Professor didn't seem to affect the bear. The boys ran in different directions as the bear charged. When the bear got close, the Professor and the boys fired. The bear roared and headed for the wagon, causing the yaks to panic. The bear eventually fell over after running into a tree. They decided to head towards home after facing stormy weather and difficult paths.

The boys returned from their adventure and found themselves faced with various tasks. They needed to tan hides, cure a fresh bear pelt, and process barley they had harvested earlier. They decided to thresh the barley using flails, a traditional method before the invention of threshing machines. They then ground the barley into flour using grinding stones they had made previously. With a longing for bread, they ventured to make their first batch, understanding the process of fermentation that causes the dough to rise. As they worked, the Baby found the honey pot and made a mess, covering himself in honey.

George had a daily routine of observing the yaks to learn about their barley field's usefulness. One day, while out exploring, he ventured to the rock cliffs near Observation Hill. The heavy sea and incoming tide made him homesick, and he shed tears. Despite feeling ashamed, he knew crying was futile. Suddenly, he noticed a peculiar sight: with each wave, there was a cannon-like noise followed by a spray of water shooting out to sea. This phenomenon was caused by a cave in the cliff where compressed air exploded when the wave closed its mouth. George learned about earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, understanding the earth's movements and how mountains and valleys were formed. The boys, planning a hunting day, felt anxious about a missing boat at South River Falls. They set off on a familiar trail, reaching the river, where the surroundings puzzled George, unable to locate the ramie plant spot.|"[""1.

Chemists have discovered that humans and animals absorb oxygen and release nitrogen to survive. Plants, on the other hand, take in nitrogen and give off oxygen. Certain germs can produce nitrogen, just like some germs create carbonic gas in dough. The United States Department of Agriculture, through its chemical division, has decided to utilize these germs. They provide a box filled with millions of these tiny creatures to farmers who request them. The germs are mixed with water and seeds, like corn, before planting. The germs stick to the seeds and continue to work in the soil, producing nitrogen that plants absorb. This process enhances plant growth, as seen in fields where germ-infected seeds are compared to untreated rows.|['1.

The group embarked on a journey to Observation Hill, where a new, larger pole stood in place of the missing one. During each visit, it was their duty to scan the horizon thoroughly. Despite their absorbing work, the boys longed for home and hoped for rescue. Communication with their loved ones would bring them contentment amidst their exploration adventures. Even though thoughts of home crept in at night, their days were filled with work and exploration. George led the way down a steep path, hoping to find a cave or pocket but was left disappointed. The boys learned a lesson in carelessness when exploring a limestone cave. The Professor silently guided them, using their mistakes as valuable teaching moments. Inside the cave, they discovered limestone formations caused by lime water trickling down, leaving behind chalk deposits. As they delved deeper, a mysterious noise interrupted their exploration, leaving them in suspense.|"[""1.

In Ireland, the shamrock represents the trinity with its three leaves, as taught by St. Patrick. The plant has unique qualities; it folds its leaves at night and adjusts to light with great precision. Odors, like sounds and light, are vibrations. Each odor has its own vibration rate, much like musical notes. Some scents harmonize, while others clash due to wrong combinations. Turpentine, lemon, orange, juniper, and rosemary odors are formed by carbon and hydrogen. The colony saved seeds for a garden to avoid hunting for food. Combining vegetables creates chemical similarities in different countries. The boys were surprised by an increase in yaks.

Every morning, the yaks left their enclosure for the feeding grounds. Sometimes, Harry or George would follow and hunt. Once, Harry was on a hill, George saw the flash of his gun before hearing the shot. George learned about the difference between sound and noise. Sound is organized vibrations like music, while noise is chaotic. Light travels faster than sound, explaining why the flash was seen before the shot was heard. The pitch of a sound changes when the distance between the source and the listener alters. A sketch illustrates how the pitch of a whistle changes as two trains approach and pass each other. Despite good health on the island, Harry felt unwell, showing signs of fever. A device is described to measure changes in pitch.|"[""1.

The Fahrenheit scale was created under unique circumstances. Fahrenheit used his body temperature as a reference point and assigned 86 degrees to it. Zero on his scale was the lowest temperature he observed in 1709. When ice melted in water, he noted 32 degrees on his thermometer. Although not very scientific, it served its purpose. To determine body temperatures, a device was made with a C-shaped piece. The scale went up to 110 degrees, with 80 as the starting point. Harry's temperature was 102, George's 98, and the Professor's 90. The device worked based on metal contraction and expansion due to heat.

George and Harry set off on a journey to the east coast with their yaks after a hearty lunch. They reached the coast within two hours, spending time collecting plant samples along the way. They found a cape and the mouth of the South River. While searching for clams, Harry stumbled upon their boat from three months ago, hidden in shrubbery. The boat was full of debris, and they found a mysterious rope and oar inside, suggesting someone else had used it recently. They decided to take the boat back home and planned to pilot it around the cliffs to the Cataract River mouth for future use. The Professor waited for them but they didn't return by sundown.|"['1.

Let's follow the boys as they encounter a series of challenges during their boat journey. The boat was equipped with oars and a rope, but the mast and sail had been removed, requiring them to row around a point. As they set off, a light wind picked up, pushing the boat adrift. The boys realized their mistake too late, with the boat out of reach. Stranded on a rocky coast, they found the broken remains of the boat wedged between rocks. With night approaching, they had to dislodge the boat to reach shore. After a struggle, they managed to break off a piece of the boat's side to steer it towards land in the growing darkness, determined to overcome the challenges they faced.|['1.

"George scanned their surroundings and chuckled at Harry's ambitious plan. ""How do you plan to do it without ropes? Pulling it up this steep beach wall won't be easy,"" he remarked. The Professor, growing increasingly worried, heard the boys' voices as they returned from Observation Hill past eight in the evening. Their joyful reunion filled the air with relief.

The boys eagerly shared their chaotic adventures, with no particular order, reflecting the day's excitement. The conversation that night revolved around their recent experiences, overshadowing all previous ones. The Professor, skeptical yet intrigued, theorized about the boat's origins, suspecting other nearby islands with inhabitants might have found it.

As they discussed their day's events, the Professor suggested improving their kitchen's sanitation. He explained the benefits of charcoal's absorbent properties, its ability to cleanse gases and liquids. Additionally, he delved into the chemical processes involving copper ore and manganese, hinting at the potential for powerful germicides like chlorine.

Harry reminded the Professor about the primary electric battery project, while George emphasized the need for better lighting."|"[""1.

All things have opposites. Up has down, darkness has light, heat has cold, strength has weakness, and joy has sorrow. When electricity is generated, it flows both ways. This is called alternate current. In a battery, the current moves from positive to negative. We will make direct current, where the flow is one way, from zinc to copper in the battery. The electrodes are called anode and cathode. The liquid in the cell is the electrolyte. Copper wire is used for its conductivity and ductility. Electricity is measured in volts for pressure and amperage for the amount of current. Just like water pressure in a tank, the force of electricity depends on volts, and the amount of current passing is measured in amperage.|['1.

"The process of wire drawing might seem simple with the right tools, but in Harry's case, they had to work with basic equipment. Harry started by shaping bars of copper into pieces about ten inches long and half an inch thick. Using a steel plate with holes of varying sizes, they pulled the copper bars through to create thinner wires. The friction generated during this process produced heat by forcing tiny particles called atoms and molecules in the metal to move and interact. In another part of the story, ""Baby,"" the orangutan, learned to use a knife and fork at the table and even helped with tasks like gathering nuts. George, a skilled cook, often included honey in his recipes, captivating Baby's attention in the kitchen."|"['1.

Harry discovered a treasure trove of prairie chicken eggs during a hunting trip in the tall grass. These eggs were a delicacy, much tastier than regular eggs. Despite Baby's fascination with them, he never ate any. George and Harry planned a surprise birthday party for the Professor, complete with sweet cakes and a gong to signal the celebration. However, Baby, in a moment of mischief, had sneaked and eaten most of the cakes. The commotion that followed left the Professor moved to tears. The boys, realizing the impact of their actions, expressed their heartfelt wishes to the Professor.

No! The baby was not punished. He came down willingly, holding some cookies, and sat at the table. The line between tears and laughter is very thin. They laughed as if they had never heard of tears. When they tried to continue eating, just one look at the baby made them burst into laughter again. Something unexpected happened. The baby, who never laughed before, laughed for the first time. This made everyone laugh even more. The Professor mentioned how laughter is contagious and powerful, just like how perfumes can travel long distances. He compared laughter to a perfume that spreads joy without needing purification, unlike harsh words that are like foul odors needing purification. They enjoyed a meal of roast prairie chicken, lentils, potatoes, cassava, sago pudding, and cakes. They drank fresh water from a spring, as the river water sometimes tasted bad. The Professor explained how tannic acid from oak bark can purify water, similar to how bitter almonds clarify Nile waters in Egypt. In India, a nut called Strychnos is used for the same purpose. The passage shows the importance of laughter and the science behind water purification.|['1.

The flowing Cataract water picks up albuminous matter as it passes through forests and vegetable banks. The impurities in the water, like astringent substances from oak or birch trees, cause the albumen to precipitate. In La Gironde, France, water from the Landes area was naturally impure due to these factors. However, cutting down oak forests improved the water quality. The primary electric battery was being developed steadily, with cells made of clay, zinc, and copper electrodes. Each cell was heavy, baked, and measured ten inches deep. The boys planned to build a new boat, deciding on a smaller vessel due to crew size and manageability. Harry suggested a boat similar in size to the previous one, with a flat bottom and a contracted prow.

The rising tide created swirling currents, indicating the need to take the wrecked lifeboat out to sea past the rocks. Despite some hesitation, the hill's surroundings were carefully inspected. Below, among seaweed and debris, an intriguing find piqued their interest. The Professor pointed out that the recovered pieces did not match their lifeboat but belonged to a ship's boat. Harry confirmed this by noting the absence of a double hull and the intact stern below. Further exploration led to the discovery of a hidden white object, revealed to be a skull. The Professor expertly analyzed the skull's condition, deducing the age of the deceased individual. Overwhelmed by the find, the boys gathered the skeleton while the Professor stayed behind.

The funeral procession slowly made its way back over the hills, paying tribute to a fallen friend. The group had doubts initially, but those were dispelled. The deceased had been with them during a shipwreck, a night of terror. The Professor pondered the skeleton found, suggesting it could help identify the lost companion. The boys were somber, discussing the event. The Professor later discussed the seven ages of man, varying between genders. He explained the reasons for Earth's population growth, using the United States as an example.

The Professor shared a plan with his students to make clay crocks for storing milk. The process involved crafting the crocks from the best clay, burning them, soaking them in a salt brine solution, and burning them again. He also suggested creating a wooden vessel with a central stem and a pulley. The students were excited and successfully made the crocks using a potter's wheel. Meanwhile, they planned to visit a cave they had discovered earlier. To improve their lighting, they worked on a battery.

This morning, we observed an interesting phenomenon with the wires from our battery. When the circuiting ends of the wires were connected, there was no current, but when they were pulled apart, a spark was produced. Let's conduct a simple experiment to demonstrate this spark. By sharpening the ends of the wires and adjusting their distance, we can create an electric arc. The arc light invention was based on this principle, where the current adjusts to maintain a steady light. As we prepared to explore the cliffs with our yaks, a distant ship was spotted, raising hopes that were later dashed as the ship sailed away. Despite the setback, the group remained vigilant, scanning the horizon for any signs of rescue.|['1.

The Professor suggested going a hundred feet into the cave and placing a lamp in a visible spot. They could then proceed with the other lamp towards the water, ensuring a backup light in case of any mishaps. As they advanced, the cave floor sloped downwards, and despite reaching a larger area with eerie icicles hanging above, there was still no sign of water. The group decided it was unwise to continue with just one light and planned to create more lights to illuminate the entire cave. To mark their findings, they needed a base line and a way to chart their discoveries. Harry proposed using chalk for markings since they had no paper available.|['1.

First, let's establish a starting point, which we'll label as A. From the spot where the light disappeared, measure westward along the line until you reach the end of the chamber. If each measurement of the spear is 5 feet, then the chamber is 125 feet long and about 90 feet wide. Let's roughly sketch out the floor plan. Moving towards the cave's entrance, measure 50 feet and stop. I've marked the line A and placed a slate slab to align with your measurements. The point B, 50 feet from here, forms an angle C. I'll move the slab to point B for another 50 feet, creating angle line E. Each new point establishes a new baseline. As we mark points, observe the side walls to outline the passageway's irregularities. The boys were captivated by the chart, only remembering the lost light upon exiting the cave, sparking wonder and curiosity. They returned home with mixed feelings after experiencing the world above and below ground. The source of water in the cave is likely rain seeping through the floor. The extent of the cave remains a mystery, fueling their curiosity for further exploration. Remember the flag as we continue our investigations. The boys were eager to work on the flag the next day, using yellow ramie cloth and aiming for red, yellow, and blue colors if available.|"[""1.

"In the laboratory, manganese ore reacts with sulfuric acid to produce chlorine gas, a powerful bleaching agent. This gas can be used directly or to create chloride of lime. The boys dyed strips of fabric red and white using this method. The red dye comes from a plant that was historically used for its red color, even turning animal bones red when consumed. This plant has smooth-edged leaves and red flowers. Chicory roots were ground up to make a coffee substitute, providing a bitter tonic. The use of bitter substances for strength is a common human instinct seen in various cultures throughout history. Baby accidentally dyed himself red, earning the nickname ""Red Angel,"" leading to laughter among the group.

A substance used to cause a chemical change in another substance is known as a reagent. For example, Nessler's Reagent can detect ammonia in water at a ratio of one part to twenty million parts of water, showing a reddish-yellow color change. The boys were working on making a flag and needed a dye. They found that the bitter-sweet plant had a suitable dye. They spent many days creating the flag and were proud of their artistic creation. To find a suitable pole for the flag, they decided to search in the forest near the South River. They prepared yaks and a two-wheeled truck to transport the pole.

The boys found themselves lost in the forest after a failed attempt at signaling. Confusion and excitement had clouded their judgment, leading them in circles. The Professor, amused by their predicament, gently chided them for their lack of direction. He explained how excitement can impair judgment, likening it to soldiers wounded in battle without realizing it. The boys learned the importance of keeping a clear mind and direction in unfamiliar situations. They found Red Angel missing upon their return, speculating he had ventured off due to his wild spirit. George, missing the mischievous dog's antics and love for honey, felt the absence more keenly. The lesson learned was to approach tasks with a calm and focused mind to avoid getting lost in the excitement.|"['1.

"Early the next day during breakfast, Red Angel surprised everyone by showing up at the door with a handful of nuts. Excitedly welcomed by all, he solemnly placed the nuts on the table and joined in eating them. Plans were now underway for ""pole-raising day."" Due to a shortage of rope, they had to cut strips from a bearskin to use alongside the ramie cord. The Professor suggested making forked poles of different lengths to support the main pole, and capstans with cranks for raising it. The yaks were readied, and a pole with a truck hitched on. They then gathered for the flag-raising ceremony at Observation Hill. Despite some comical interruptions, they successfully raised the pole, symbolizing their survival and sovereignty."|"['1.

George called out to Red Angel, a mischievous orangutan perched high above, but the playful creature paid no heed. With a smile, Red Angel focused on spinning a wheel, unfazed by George's attempts to lure him down with a honey pot. The comical situation of a primate thwarting a flag-raising ceremony amused Harry and the Professor. Despite the laughter, the need to hoist the flag properly lingered. As the group prepared to raise the flag, Red Angel grasped the significance and descended silently, acknowledging the transfer of allegiance to the United States. The solemn act of raising the flag, though lacking music, held a profound meaning as the group sang 'The Star-Spangled Banner.' Tears welled up, and a sense of duty and pride filled the air as the flag fluttered, signifying the land's protection under a new authority.|"['1.

"As they descended the slope, they couldn't resist turning back repeatedly to admire the flag and the pole, feeling a deep connection to every detail. George, always sentimental, mused, ""I believe our flag is the most beautiful, but others may feel the same about theirs. How did flags originate?"" His companion explained, ""Flags evolved from banners, derived from the Celtic word 'band.' Early references in the Bible and Roman history show their ancient use. In the Middle Ages, they bridged military and religious realms. Symbols like the crescent and cross represented global forces. After a tiring day raising a flagpole, they relaxed at home, dreaming of crafting glass for various utilities. Making glass involves melting it, with the challenge lying in shaping it into desired forms like windows. Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians excelled in glassmaking, evolving from opaque to transparent products over centuries."""|"['1.

In the morning, the boys were up early, eager to learn and work. Harry readied the clay crucible while George broke up lime for grinding. The Professor oversaw the melting of sand to create glass, explaining its properties. He instructed the boys to prepare slate slabs for pouring the molten glass. The process required careful attention to detail to avoid impurities. The goal was to produce quality glass suitable for their needs. The Professor emphasized the importance of the right balance of materials for successful glassmaking. The boys understood the significance of their task and worked diligently under the Professor's guidance. Their focus was on safety and precision as they embarked on this educational journey.|"[""1.

The explorers had six old guns, small pistols with short barrels, and low-quality powder. They discussed the risks of facing savage tribes with such inadequate weapons. The Professor mentioned a sail they spotted, suggesting hope for rescue. They decided to build a boat to leave the island. The boat needed to be large and sturdy to sail around the island and possibly reach a neighboring civilized island. They also considered planting crops for sustenance. The Professor explained techniques for improving crops and fruits. Harry suggested the boat could help them reach a nearby island.

Beyond the Cataract lay a flat meadow, ideal for farming as the Professor believed. They decided to use this field for agriculture. Meanwhile, they worked on plans for their boat. The recovered back part of the lifeboat helped them understand better. When they landed on the rock, they found the stern lodged in the rocks, but it got dislodged by a wave. Months later, they found it a hundred feet inland. The recovered part was in good shape, but the hull needed work to attach the new bow part. Harry planned to extend the vessel to twenty feet long and six and a half feet wide, with a depth of two and a half feet for security and capacity. They discussed sails and masts, settling on a 150 square feet sail area for safety and ease of use. During a hunting expedition, they found signs of human presence, making them rethink leaving the Cataract.|['1.

"Harry responded, ""I've noted that. We're currently following our shadow, right? In six hours, around four o'clock, which way should we head to reach the wagon, judging by the shadow?"" Despite the frequent appearance of small animals, neither had a chance to showcase their skills as they were focused on their route. They continued southwest as planned. ""I think we've covered quite a distance chasing the ocelot. We trailed him for two miles and another two from the river to the forest. We must be about six miles away,"" George estimated. As they progressed, the trees became smaller, indicating a young forest with lush grass and various unfamiliar birds. George suggested aiming for the two large trees on the right for their return journey and using a log for lunch. They circled a clearing and found primitive huts with bones, clay vessels, and clam shells inside. The large hut was circular and made of saplings and clay. While examining the area, George discovered a scrap of paper that appeared to have writing on it. They carefully examined other items found, including a brass button, a buckle, a knife blade, a metal disk, and a rusted steel ring."|['1.

As the boys uncovered more clues in the huts, they realized they might have belonged to savages who took items from captives. They found a paper with a message they hoped to decipher later with the Professor's help. The next step was to thoroughly examine all materials and survey the area. They decided to change their route, discovering a ridge leading north with less dense woods. The load was heavier, making them tired but determined. Returning to the raft, they headed back to Cataract before evening. George revealed the findings to the Professor, who was intrigued by the paper's writing.

After you left, I decided to take a walk towards the cliffs by the sea. The valley and incline beyond caught my attention. The limestone ridge had wide cleavages creating caverns. I explored hoping to find more caves but only found one with a skeleton on a wooden cot. Arrows were scattered around, indicating the man was cast ashore or shipwrecked. There was no clothing or signs of violence on the bones. The arrows suggest he might have been attacked by natives. The decayed state of the arrows and cot indicate the skeleton is quite old. George and I discussed the possibilities, concluding that we need to be prepared to face the challenges of this island.

The Professor was aware of the dangers of idleness and made efforts to engage the boys in productive activities. Harry excelled in building, while George preferred outdoor tasks. The boys worked diligently for two weeks until the Professor suggested a day of leisure. The Professor emphasized the importance of staying youthful in mind and spirit. The boys discussed their next hunting expedition, ultimately deciding to explore the forest to the west due to the scarcity of honey trees. They embarked on a journey, exploring new territories and revisiting significant locations. Red Angel, the orangutan, showcased his climbing skills.
