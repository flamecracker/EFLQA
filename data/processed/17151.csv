The official sternly instructed not to release anyone, indicating that the person was being taken to court.

Foster expressed his belief that Dardus was money-driven and unconcerned about legality. However, he defended the boy, stating that Dardus disliked him.

"One day Sam approached me and requested that I ride to a creek near what is now the town of Fairfax to watch over a herd of about thirty cattle he had recently purchased. We were aware of a group of Crow Indians in the area. However, in those times, following a man's orders was akin to avoiding questions. If instructed to do something, it was your duty to comply, or face the consequences. Reluctantly, I saddled a worn-out horse and set off, though I was not enthusiastic about the task. Rumors circulated that Sam had obtained some cattle from the Indians, leading us to suspect foul play. Riding about thirty miles, I found the cattle in good condition, grazing on lush grass near a water source. Sam had promised to return in a few days to drive them back to the main herd.
