One morning, very early, before the sun was up, I woke up and saw the dew sparkling on each buttercup. But my lazy shadow, still in bed, had not stirred, fast asleep, an arrant sleepyhead. My tea is almost ready, the sun has left the sky; it's time to look out the window as Leerie goes by. Every evening at teatime, before you take your seat, with his lantern and ladder, he walks up the street. Now Tom dreams of driving, Maria wants to sail the sea, my papa's a banker, as rich as can be. But me, when I'm older, and I can choose what to do, O Leerie, I'll light the lamps with you! We are lucky with a lamp by our door, Leerie stops to light it, and then many more. So, before you hurry past with your ladder and your light, O Leerie, nod to the child tonight!|"['1.
