The life of a scout is adventurous and bold. Their legs bare, they fear no dare. Scouts play a significant role in unique events, often unfolding in quiet woodland communities far from worldly gossip. One such tale involves Aaron Harlowe and Tom Slade at Temple Camp. Rain poured for a week, saturating the ground and cabins. The lake swelled, springboard submerged, rowboats half-filled. The camp's spring overflowed, flooding cabins. The Silver Fox Patrol sought shelter in the pavilion, watching the gloomy scene across the lake. Amidst banter and games, some braved the rain for fish, but even they hid. Rain continued relentlessly until a strong wind finally forced scouts indoors on Friday afternoon.|"[""1.

As the storm raged on, the young camp assistant, Tom Slade, stood by the door, his arm raised to shield his eyes from the wind. The boys gathered around him, intrigued by the impending danger. Tom, popular among the campers, raised his voice over the howling wind to warn them of the possible catastrophe. The storm's intensity made them realize the peril they faced.

A few scout leaders set out to explore the area, while Tom plans a risky journey across the lake with three other scouts. Pee-wee gathers supplies, and they all embark in a sturdy boat against the fierce wind and rain. As they row, they struggle against the elements, trying to stay close to the shore for safety. Suddenly, they realize they are in grave danger as the water rushes towards them from the mountain, carrying debris from the storm. With no way to land or escape the powerful current, they are swept closer to the dangerous cove. The camp's lights twinkle in the distance, a stark contrast to the perilous situation the four scouts find themselves in.|"[""1.

The boat abruptly careened into the cove, creating a loud scraping and tearing noise. It tossed its passengers into the swirling water before settling sideways. The boys clung to a broken tree in the cove, partially submerged, forming a makeshift dam. The boat got entangled in the branches, adding to the blockage. Hervey Willetts, known for his daring stunts, had a special relationship with trees. He could hang upside down or shimmy up trees underwater. Despite not knowing tree types, he could play a harmonica while hanging from a branch. The fallen tree, a victim of the storm, guided them to safety. Tom realized the tree could help control the flooding temporarily. The scene hinted at the devastation caused by the storm, including the loss of the rustic bridge and Berry's garage. The whereabouts of the old horse-drawn bus remained unknown.|"['1.

Hervey remembered Tom's advice on spotting dark objects in the dark as he navigated the rugged terrain towards the bridge.

As he trudged on, battling the wind and rain, a sudden movement in the woods startled him. With a racing heart, he cautiously approached the source of the movement, only to discover it was a trick of the shadows.

Hervey, oh Hervey, what kind of scout are you? Didn't you realize the eagle's cry came from the northern mountain? Eagles live on mountain cliffs, didn't you know that?

Suddenly, Lefty, the horse, began to act erratically, almost dragging everyone into a ditch. The narrator saw a strange figure hanging onto the bridle, making an eerie noise. Initially, they thought it was a ghost or Hasbrooks' boy, who had fits. The narrator, recalling driving the hearse for the boy, insisted no son of theirs would be buried so quickly.

The bus stopped a short distance from the collapsed bridge. The passengers cautiously peered into the deep gap, filled with silent awe at the potential disaster that could have occurred. The area surrounding the bridge was in complete ruin, with no trace of the once rustic structure. The floodwaters had receded, leaving only a small stream flowing through the gully. Scouts from the camp arrived with stretchers and first aid supplies after battling through the storm. They found a scout unconscious, believed to be a victim of the storm. Despite his disheveled appearance, his scoutmaster recognized him by his hat adorned with badges.

The young assistant, full of adventure and kindness, welcomed scoutmasters and scouts with open arms. He embodied the true spirit of scouting, caring more about important matters than trivial ones. With their manuals in hand, they embraced the great outdoors. As they discussed the mysterious car left behind, Ebon Berry, the garage owner, joined them. The car belonged to someone who had disappeared a week ago. Curiosity piqued, they searched the vehicle and found motorist's gloves, a map, a newspaper, and letters. Examining the papers under a flashlight, they discovered a hidden route up the mountain. The group stood in awe, realizing the secret path marked on the map.|"['1.

The message in the letter was not very exciting. It was just the final page of a letter kept for some small notes on the back. The letter mentioned hoping for a return to England someday, acknowledging how America might feel strange after so long. Shooting Indians and buffaloes seemed to be the new norm, but they promised to save some foxes for the reader. The letter also reminded not to forget horseback riding and the rattle wagons. Tom then checked the newspaper, expecting nothing interesting until a headline caught his eye. An unfortunate accident occurred near Hillsburgh involving a gray roadster hitting an eight-year-old boy named Willy Corbett. Witnesses blamed the driver for reckless driving. Tom considered following a trail up the mountain to investigate further but decided to go alone.|['1.

Tom and his friends embarked on a journey up the mountain, noticing the trail marked by someone. The bright patch on the mountaintop had vanished, adding to the mystery. They speculated about the gray roadster left behind, possibly linked to a newspaper article about a fugitive. Despite the storm's destruction, they pressed on, encountering fallen trees and rocks.

Toward the top, the path disappeared under debris, but the group made their way to Temple Camp where two troops were finishing stew. A light on the lake caught their attention, but they didn't approach due to the steep drop. Under a trunk, they found a board that connected the wilderness to humanity. Beneath it lay a man's body, his face frozen in a grin. As they watched in fear and respect, the surroundings echoed with eerie sounds. Among the man's belongings were cards and a letter, revealing his identity. The discovery solved the mystery of the man's demise due to his cowardly actions. Exploring further, they found remnants of a primitive shack nearby.|"[""1.

Tom carefully placed the cards and letter in the deceased man's pocket to prevent the wind from carrying them away. The group then made their way back down the mountain and eventually reached the shore of the lake. That marked the end of the eventful night at Temple Camp, a night filled with death and destruction. The powerful wind that had wreaked havoc and brought relentless rain for weeks finally subsided. The following morning, the sun shone brightly on Temple Camp, illuminating Goliath sitting on the springboard. Despite the teasing from other scouts in rowboats below, Goliath faced some criticism for not adhering to scout laws. As the scoutmaster intervened, he reminded the scouts about the importance of treating Goliath kindly due to his fragile health. The scouts were urged to befriend and support him during their time at camp.|"[""1.

The scouts at Temple Camp were diligent in following the rules. They gathered around the bulletin board daily to stay informed about camp activities. One day, a solemn procession descended from the storm-wrecked mountain with county officials carrying a stretcher covered in a white sheet. Tom Slade, who had assisted in the discovery, was absent from camp that day. The tragic end of Aaron Harlowe, a fugitive, was revealed. Despite his attempt to make amends, his death raised questions. A mysterious light on the mountain puzzled Tom. Did Harlowe climb to escape or seek someone? The light vanished with the storm, leaving behind a mystery that lingered in Tom's mind.|"['1.

Tom asked the authorities if there was a link between the article and the letter the dead man received from England, but the sheriff saw no connection. The newspapers later reported the tragic end of Aaron Harlowe, who died in a storm after fleeing. Tom, intrigued by the case, left the authorities unsatisfied and with a sprained ankle. He wore a unique hat and used a stick to adjust his stocking. Eating a tomato, he faced a dilemma whether to finish it or use it to splatter the bulletin board. Opting for the latter, the tomato created a red mess on the board, including the hike details, turning it into a crimson sea.

"""If I hadn't thrown the tomato, I wouldn't have learned that,"" Hervey mentioned, feeling justified by the juicy surprise. ""You never know what's coming next,"" he added, embracing the unpredictable. Despite his carefree nature, Hervey faced the consequences of his actions head-on.

The young assistant at camp ventured off the trail, making his way through the trees towards the main pavilion.

Mr. Denny was a bit annoyed when he mentioned that the real issue was the disobedience. Tom, feeling a bit nettled too, stood up with determination, his lips taking on a strong, rugged look from his hoodlum days. He walked confidently to where the scouts were gathered under the trees. Tom, with a breezy assurance, sat at a trustee's desk, grabbed camp stationery, and wrote a letter summoning someone for a Court of Honor meeting. He then asked Tyson, who he knew could sprint, to deliver the letter to Hervey Willetts, who had left camp earlier. Tyson understood Hervey well and didn't waste time tracking him down, showing his scouting skills.

Gilbert, a newcomer at camp, was determined to track down Hervey. Despite his limited knowledge of tracking, he trusted his instincts about human behavior. Gilbert eliminated the road as Hervey's route, believing he would not find him there. Aware that all trails lead somewhere, Gilbert carefully examined the trail's beginning near the road. He noticed a rectangular impression in the damp earth, possibly from a box. Two ruffled spots indicated a suitcase had been there. Confident he found the right trail, Gilbert followed it with excitement, verifying footprints in the earth. The trail became challenging as it passed through marshy areas, but Gilbert persisted until he encountered a chilling sight ahead—a log resembling a sinking ship.

Gilbert cautiously retreated from the treacherous monster, feeling relief as he stood on firmer ground. Watching a sinking log, he noticed a yellow spot that vanished, leaving only a gray speck. Straining his eyes, he saw tiny sparkling specks in the growing darkness. Advancing carefully, he spotted Hervey Willetts' cap, floating defiantly. Overwhelmed, Gilbert hesitated, torn between danger and the need to act. He couldn't return empty-handed but felt powerless.|"['1.

He wandered through the marsh, unaware of the danger, until he found himself in a fatal spot. Gilbert shuddered at the thought. Did he cry for help? Gilbert wondered how terrifying it must have been to call out for help and hear only echoes. As he prepared to recover the lost item, a grim thought crossed his mind about what he might find. Despite his hesitation, he cast a line with hooks and a heavy stone attached. After a few failed attempts, he finally hooked the lost item, a cap. Gilbert reflected on the tragic death of its owner, Hervey. The cap bore various pins and badges, a poignant reminder of the young man. Gilbert, deeply affected by the discovery, made his way back to camp, haunted by the unsettling nature of Hervey's death.|"['1.

Gilbert walked back on the trail, lost in thought. He remembered stories of hats found in lakes, a sign of drowning, yet the owners miraculously reappeared. But this was different. The image of the bird landing on the sinking log lingered in his mind. The bird flew away effortlessly, unlike any mortal. Gilbert felt uneasy, unsure how to tell Tom Slade about this eerie encounter on his first day at camp. Spotting a distant light, likely from the camp, Gilbert decided to follow it, abandoning the trail. As he neared the light, he noticed another light nearby, realizing he was veering off course. Gilbert learned that trails can be tricky, and artificial beacons unreliable. He found himself following a false light reflected in a puddle, navigating through wet woods and fallen debris under the starlit sky.|"[""1.

Gilbert cautiously approached the fallen tree, noticing the earth's wound where its roots had been ripped out. It created a shelter with hanging tentacles, emitting a damp earthy smell. As he peered closer, a faint light inside caught his attention. Gilbert suspected hoboes or thieves might be inside. Despite being a new scout, Gilbert ventured closer, hearing voices. The strange scene perplexed him, as it was unlike anything he had read in his scout handbook. The mysterious voice inside made him realize he didn't recognize any of the campers.

Hervey swung on the swing, chatting with Hoody about the camp's Gold Cross award. He mentioned the camp's attractions like a spot for making marshmallows and a place to climb the drain-pipe to the roof. Hervey even challenged Hoody to do a hand-spring on the messboards. Despite his heroic deed that led to his nomination, Hervey seemed unaware of why he was receiving the honor. He humbly kept quiet about his exploit, even when prompted by Mr. Denny. As they strolled through the woods, Hervey entertained his friends with a song. Plans were in place to inspect the camp's washed-out cove and build a dam. Tom, responsible for showing engineers the weak spot, also prepared for the upcoming Court of Honor meeting. He checked the names of new campers to assist them in settling in.|['1.

When they managed to get him on the bus, he mumbled something, and it seemed like he was referring to his foot. However, it turned out he was talking about the bridge.

"The chairman's voice droned, ""Hill cabin twenty-two. Right. We will talk later. It may be a week or two before you receive this, Willetts. Meanwhile, the Camp thanks you and is proud of your heroism. It's most unusual----""""I think he's a wild Indian,"" Tom chuckled. ""Or maybe a squirrel, huh? Hey, Hervey? Because of climbing.... You know, Mr. Denny, those are the two things that can't be tamed, an Indian and a squirrel. You can tame a lion, but you can't tame a squirrel.""No crowd followed him out. His troop was unaware of his triumph. A scoutmaster shook his hand, ""Wonderful, my boy!"" Hervey smiled, looking surprised. Outside, people sat around, chatting, but no one spoke to him.

A wandering minstrel caught in his own tune, Hervey found himself surrounded by friends who playfully teased him. Despite being caught off guard, he embraced the camaraderie at the camp, engaging with civil engineers and laborers.

"As they rode along, Tom remarked, ""It's starting to resemble a dam, right? We won't be able to add more stone behind the pavilion. The dam is expected to raise the lake level by about five or six feet, according to the engineers. This might require moving a couple of cabins back. The recent storm turned out to be a blessing in disguise, don't you think?"" Hood looked at Tom, intrigued. Tom's casual and cheerful manner often hinted at a deeper understanding of things left unspoken. It was challenging to decipher his thoughts.

The remarkable event that concluded this tale unfolded before a group of scouts at Temple Camp. It occurred suddenly, as acts of bravery often do, leaving differing accounts of what transpired.
