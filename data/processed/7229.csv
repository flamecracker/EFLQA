In the evening, the Doctor checked the cage and approved its strength. Just before dark, he, a woman, and a child entered it. Villagers secured the roof beams. Wilson and Richards climbed a tree nearby. The shikari cleared the view. As night fell, Richards worried about the darkness. Wilson assured him they'd adjust. Suddenly, a cry and wail broke the silence. Wilson grumbled about the noise. The shikari alerted them of a tiger. They spotted a shape in the bushes. The tiger circled, drawn by the cries.

After a satisfying meal and a quick cigar, they settled in for a short nap before riding back to Deennugghur at daybreak.

"""It's essential, Miss Hannay, for the Commandant and officers to return immediately. If the Sepoys refuse cartridges, it could lead to trouble,"" explained the Major. After a discussion, they decided to head back promptly. The Doctor suggested that canceling the tiger hunt might cause rumors and panic among the natives.

The Doctor and Bathurst prepared to face a tiger. With the shikari's signal, the hunt began with a loud clamor. The Doctor noticed Bathurst's tense demeanor but remained calm. As the tiger emerged, the Doctor shot, and Bathurst bravely thrust a spear, saving the elephant's mahout. The tiger fell lifeless, sparing Bathurst from harm. The Doctor praised Bathurst's courage, despite his initial nerves. The successful hunt concluded with the skinning of the tiger and the Doctor's reassurance to Bathurst that true courage would shine through in the end.

As they arrived at the familiar place, the Doctor expressed relief that no trouble had started in their absence. Bathurst decided to head to Nilpore for his rounds, maintaining normalcy until the situation escalated. Precautions were being quietly taken to fortify the courthouse with ammunition, provisions, and water. The plan was for everyone to seek safety there in case of unrest. Major assigned Bathurst to oversee the courthouse arrangements due to his flexibility and ability to move discreetly. It was suggested that Bathurst move into the courthouse immediately to be prepared. The guise of setting up a hospital there would facilitate the stocking of supplies. The idea was to spread the word subtly among the native officers to prepare for potential unrest.|"[""1.

During this time, the news from Cawnpore remained positive. The Rajah of Bithoor offered support to Sir Hugh Wheeler, strengthening the British forces. Sir Hugh, with only a few Europeans, received a reinforcement from Lucknow. He set up defenses for the station's residents and refugees. Despite tensions, Major Hannay chose to remain at Deennugghur, showing faith in his troops. The Europeans prepared for potential outbreaks, staying vigilant. The hospital became a safe haven, well-stocked with supplies. The women gathered at Mr. Hunter's bungalow, working on fortifications and supporting each other.

Isobel was troubled by the changes in the men around her. Mr. Hunter, once calm, was now restless. The Major was kinder than usual, and the Doctor was irritable. Her husband seemed unusually happy, Rintoul quieter, and the younger boys more mature. Richards cared less about his appearance and more about serious matters. Captain Forster remained unchanged. Bathurst stayed away, focusing on work. Isobel felt regret for her outburst about a man's cowardice and resented the Doctor for repeating it. She was upset with Bathurst for avoiding her and was frustrated that she allowed these thoughts to occupy her mind during such dangerous times. Major Hannay received a warning letter in Hindustanee about an uprising in Cawnpore and Deennugghur, believed to be from a juggler who had promised to protect Bathurst.|"['**Question 1:** How did Isobel feel about the changes in the men around her?\n- A) Happy\n- B) Indifferent\n- C) Troubled\n- D) Excited\n- E) Relieved', '**Question 2:** Which man remained unchanged according to the text?\n- A) Mr. Hunter\n- B) The Major\n- C) The Doctor\n- D) Captain Forster\n- E) Bathurst', '**Question 3:** Why was Isobel upset with Bathurst?\n- A) For being too happy\n- B) For being irritable\n- C) For avoiding her\n- D) For caring less about his appearance\n- E) For being kinder than usual', ""**Question 4:** What did Isobel regret saying about a man's cowardice?\n- A) That he was brave\n- B) That he was strong\n- C) That he was smart\n- D) That he was a coward\n- E) That he was kind"", '**Question 5:** Who received a warning letter about an uprising in Cawnpore and Deennugghur?\n- A) Isobel\n- B) Major Hannay\n- C) Bathurst\n- D) The Doctor\n- E) Richards', '**Question 6:** Who was believed to have sent the warning letter about the uprising?\n- A) Bathurst\n- B) The Doctor\n- C) A juggler\n- D) Captain Forster\n- E) Mr. Hunter']"|['** C) Troubled', '** D) Captain Forster', '** C) For avoiding her', '** D) That he was a coward', '** B) Major Hannay', '** C) A juggler']
Bathurst reluctantly recounted an incident where he bravely rescued a girl from a tiger attack. He explained to the Major that the girl was unharmed but needed care due to shock. Concerned about the safety of women and children in the face of the Sepoy rebellion, they discussed the need for a quiet consultation with civilians like Mr. Hunter. They decided to discreetly inform others to avoid alerting the servants. After dinner, the Doctor expressed his concerns about the escalating rebellion and the danger it posed to everyone, especially women and children. He acknowledged the gravity of the situation and the need for caution in the face of the impending crisis.|['1.

The situation was dire as Bathurst conveyed the imminent danger to the group. The news of impending peril was met with a surprising calmness by all. The tension had been building, and the realization that the crisis had finally arrived was almost a relief. Bathurst went from house to house, presenting the grim options: either attempt a perilous journey to Allahabad or seek shelter in the fort. The group gathered at Major Hannay's by nine o'clock.

"""I am glad you have all decided so,"" he said quietly. ""In the state the country is, the chances of getting to Allahabad are next to nothing. Here we may hold out till Lawrence restores order at Lucknow, and then he may be able to send a party to bring us in. Or the mutineers may draw off and march to Delhi. I certainly think the chances are best here; besides, every rifle we have is of importance, and though if any of you had made up your minds to try and escape I should have made no objection, I am glad that we shall all stand together here.""

The arrangements were then briefly made for the removal to the courthouse. All were to go back and apparently to retire to bed as usual. At twelve o'clock the men, armed, were to call up their servants, load them up with such things as were most required, and proceed with them, the women, and children, at once to the courthouse. Half the men were to remain there on guard, while the others would continue with the servants to make journeys backwards and forwards to the bungalows, bringing in as much as could be carried, the guard to be changed every hour. In the morning the servants were all to have the choice given them of remaining with their masters or leaving.

The Doctor entered the room cheerfully and took command as this place was under his care. Wilson and Richards were appointed as lieutenants. They decided to light lamps in the lower rooms to organize the space. The Doctor instructed the ladies to bring their belongings inside while the men brought in supplies.

"""The assembly is in progress,"" stated the Doctor, hearing the bugle. ""The men are leaving their tents. Look, there's Forster; he just mounted; quite brave."" Instead of heading to the parade ground, the Sepoys lingered near their tents. The cavalry got ready in their lines.

The Major gave orders for the men to take their positions on the roof. He assigned specific roles to each man, ensuring they were ready to fire. Forster, despite having one arm in a sling, insisted he could still shoot. Suddenly, Bathurst, looking pale, caught everyone's attention.

Bathurst had not been hit but had fainted from the stress.

The Doctor had not been at his post long when Isobel Hannay joined him on the terrace. Their recent interactions had been limited, as the Doctor had stopped his morning chats since their discussion about Bathurst. The Doctor expressed disappointment in Isobel's behavior, emphasizing that it was wrong to judge Bathurst for his nervousness under fire. He explained that Bathurst's fear was a constitutional issue beyond his control, similar to others who have specific fears despite their courage in other aspects.

Captain Forster mentioned that Dr. Wade believed Bathurst placed himself in a challenging situation to overcome his fear of fire. Despite not personally liking Bathurst due to their past at school where Bathurst was seen as a coward and a sneak, Captain Forster acknowledged Dr. Wade's perspective that Bathurst might be morally brave but struggles with his nerves. Captain Doolan expressed his support for Bathurst but agreed that inappropriate behavior, especially in dangerous situations involving women and children, cannot be excused.

The doctor had to admit that the Major's advice was smart, so he refrained from arguing or being sarcastic. He struggled to control his urge to argue but instead spent hours on the terrace watching for any lurking enemies to shoot. His accurate shooting made the enemies fear him. However, this caused a temporary rift between Wilson and Richards. Although they were good friends, they argued fiercely over Bathurst being shunned. The doctor, respecting Major Hannay's wishes, had the ladies on Bathurst's side. They admired his bravery during a tiger encounter and his helpfulness during the crisis.

The Doctor invited Bathurst to join them for a discussion. Bathurst was previously seen as a coward due to his nervousness, but the Major, Wilson, and the ladies understood and supported him. However, the other men in the camp were not as understanding. Bathurst felt relieved that his fear was no longer a secret and agreed to join the discussion. Mrs. Doolan reassured him that the anticipation of fear is often worse than the reality. The Major sought Bathurst's knowledge about the Zemindars in the area and their potential involvement. Despite his fear of firearms, Bathurst offered to gather information from the enemy's camp, disguised as a native. He planned a risky but strategic approach to avoid detection.

The situation is dire. The mutineers pose a significant threat. Our only hope lies in Lawrence's victory at Lucknow. If he can defeat the Sepoys, there might be a chance for rescue. However, the odds are slim. The population of Lucknow is volatile, adding to the challenges. The absence of Forster, who left without bidding farewell, is unsettling.

The plan to escape from the encirclement was discussed by Major Bathurst and his team. They decided to mine a gallery from the cellar to a clump of bushes about a hundred yards away. The goal was to work day and night to create a path for their escape before the situation became dire. The team consisted of Wilson, Richards, and three civilians - Saunderson, Austin, and Herbert.

Mrs. Doolan expressed surprise at Forster's unexpected display of remorse upon leaving. She compared him to a rat deserting a sinking ship, emphasizing his selfish nature. Isobel found the discussion intriguing and pondered why scoundrels like Forster are often more likable than good men. The conversation shifted to the challenges faced by the besieged group, with the enemy intensifying their attacks. The defenders struggled with deteriorating conditions, breaches in the walls, and a relentless barrage of fire. Despite mounting casualties and dwindling numbers, surrender was never considered. The group faced not only physical threats but also the psychological toll of the siege, with exhaustion, sleep deprivation, and constant anxiety taking their toll on the defenders.|"['1.

The work at the gallery had been stopped for a while. They had tried to dig upwards until roots near the surface hinted at a clump of bushes beyond the walls. However, flight was now impossible due to their weakened state. Major Hannay was badly injured on the sixth day. As the enemy's fire eased that night, the group gathered for a council.

The doctor and Bathurst discuss their journey down the river and the potential dangers they may face near Cawnpore. The doctor suggests a plan to land on the opposite bank and walk past Cawnpore to avoid any potential threats. Bathurst expresses concern about leaving behind the sick passengers, but the doctor reassures him that they can carry the wounded and sacrifice the luggage to ensure everyone's safety.

The young chief quickly agreed, and the boat was rowed to the other boat where the plan was explained and accepted without objections. The decision to dispose of all the luggage was met with approval, lifting a sense of relief from everyone. They decided to land near bushes and young trees along the river, creating stretchers with poles and blankets to carry the sick. While keeping close to the left bank, they occasionally had to navigate shallows on the right. Maintaining silence near the shore to avoid detection, they continued rowing into the night. Suddenly, a hail from the shore led to cannon fire and musket shots, causing chaos and casualties. Some managed to swim to safety, while others were swept away. Injured, Bathurst was dragged ashore by locals, and the group realized they were the only survivors.

Bathurst believed in Rujub's ability to communicate with him through mysterious means. He was convinced that Isobel Hannay, the woman he was searching for, was alive. Despite the dangers they faced, Bathurst held onto hope due to a vision he had seen in the smoke. He refused to believe that Isobel had perished during the attack.

Bathurst's skin tone needed to match his disguise. Rujub, the expert, attended to his wound and skillfully dyed his skin. After darkening his eyebrows, eyelashes, and mustache, Bathurst was unrecognizable. They set off to Cawnpore, blending in with the crowd. Bathurst, weakened by blood loss, ate heartily and drank wine to regain strength. Rujub, dressed as before, prepared the cart for their journey. On the way, they discussed the British forces at Allahabad and the Nana's troops. Bathurst echoed Rujub's anti-British sentiments loudly. As they neared the palace, Bathurst hoped to see Isobel but didn't. They settled in a quiet spot, reminiscing about the past fete.

Rujub explained to Bathurst that he couldn't prevent the attack on the boats or warn him because he was warned about the surrender to the Nana. Rujub rode to Cawnpore after ensuring Bathurst's safety in the boats. His daughter at Cawnpore warned him that the Nana was angry with him. Rujub tried to warn Bathurst but couldn't. Bathurst felt uneasy but couldn't avoid the danger even if he knew. Miss Hannay was to be brought to Bithoor by the Rajah's orders. Bathurst wanted to save everyone, especially Miss Hannay. Rujub warned that rescuing her from the zenana wouldn't be easy. Bathurst was frustrated and wanted to take drastic action, but Rujub advised against it.

The lady in the zenana is unwell, and her attendants are concerned about her condition. A plan is devised to help her regain strength. Bathurst, a character in the story, suggests using external drugs to create the appearance of a severe illness to deter unwanted attention from the English girl in the zenana. He instructs his companion to gather the necessary substances from local shops. Bathurst is determined to help the lady in the zenana and asks for specific drugs like nitric acid and caustic potash.

Rabda practiced the English words until she got them right. She then returned to the palace, while Bathurst and his friend went to find their vehicle. They easily located shops selling items looted from Cawnpore. Rujub found a black box of drugs for sale, including poisons. Bathurst tested some chemicals on himself to understand their effects. In a letter to Miss Hannay, he explained that the Nana's wife planned to harm her. He advised her on using the contents of two bottles: one harmless, the other harmful.

Bathurst pointed out the bottles, instructing to give one to Isobel and the others separately. The philter must be administered by the person delivering it, followed by a half-hour vigil. Isobel must be left alone till morning, then claim she has a fever. Rabda's message brought hope to Isobel, who had faced a nightmare during the siege. Captured and taken to Bithoor, she discovered a flicker of hope through a mysterious woman's whisper. Isobel's mind raced, recognizing the woman as the juggler's daughter, whom Bathurst had saved.

At Bithoor, the treacherous Rajah held power over Isobel in the zenana, a place no man had entered except its master. She felt helpless, yet comforted by the thought that someone cared. Tears of relief filled her eyes as she read the note from Rabda, the juggler's daughter. Isobel's heart swelled with gratitude, and she embraced Rabda with gratitude. The room emptied, leaving them alone. Rabda discreetly closed the door and handed Isobel vials and a note.

Rabda advised her friend not to risk rescuing her, as she believed she was safe. Rabda decided to make herself appear hideous to deter her captor. She concealed a note and pretended Isobel was asleep. Rabda used acid to disfigure herself, causing pain and fever. Isobel's appearance shocked the mistress of the zenana the next morning.

The Rajah gestured impatiently, and the woman silently led him to where Isobel lay. The Nana was taken aback by Isobel's appearance, fearing contagion. The woman explained how Isobel had worsened overnight, prompting the Rajah to order her removal to Subada Ke Kothee. The Rajah vowed to investigate further, threatening severe consequences if foul play was discovered. Meanwhile, Poomba praised the effectiveness of the father's potion in disfiguring Isobel. Rabda, wanting to please Poomba, applied ointment to Isobel's sores. Rabda then signaled for Isobel to put her gown back on, hinting at a journey to Cawnpore.

In a short time, a lady approached to announce that the palanquin was ready at the entrance of the zenana garden. Isobel was gently placed on a cushion and covered with a light shawl. Carried by six female attendants downstairs, Rabda and the zenana mistress, both veiled, accompanied them. Outside awaited a grand palanquin with bearers, soldiers, and an officer. Isobel and Rabda settled inside. The lady instructed Rabda not to return that day, allowing her to spend time and visit friends in town, with a promise to call her back. Upon reaching the Subada Ke Kothee building, the gates opened, and Isobel was taken inside to a room used as a prison for white women and children. Rabda revealed Isobel's condition to Mrs. Hunter, who recognized her and offered help. Isobel explained her situation, expressing gratitude for Rabda's bravery and care.

Some men carried a large pot of rice. The guards let her pass without any trouble as the officer in the palanquin had informed them that a lady from the Rajah's zenana would be leaving soon. A similar message was relayed to the officer at the main gate, who wanted to see her hand and arm to confirm her identity. Satisfied that she was not a disguised white woman, Rabda headed to her father's house. As expected, her father and Bathurst were not home, as they were supposed to meet in the garden at eight o'clock. They returned at eleven, worried about her absence. The girl was burnt badly, but Bathurst managed to get ointment for her. The situation was challenging, but they were determined to succeed.

Rujub and Bathurst discussed a plan to rescue a woman from a prison. Bathurst decided to stay and watch for any signs of danger. They observed the Subada Ke Kothee, a strong fortress with only one main gate guarded by sentries. Bathurst was hesitant about the dangers of breaking in due to the guards and soldiers inside. Rujub suggested that he could easily handle the outside sentries but was unsure about the guards within. They planned to gather information by mingling in the town and observing the palace.

Bathurst kept himself updated on the prison's activities daily. Isobel, who had stopped being taken care of, was now looking after Mary Hunter. Mary had fallen ill with a fever soon after Isobel arrived at the prison and was now in a delirious state. Bathurst feared that Mary's health was deteriorating rapidly based on Rabda's reports over the next couple of days. The prisoners were all suffering due to the cramped conditions, with many losing their lives. Rabda, in tears, suggested a risky plan to help Bathurst escape with Isobel's assistance.
