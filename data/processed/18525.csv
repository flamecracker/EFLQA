"A woodsman often marks his path by chipping trees with an axe, leaving white scars on their trunks. To follow, you look for these marks from tree to tree. If you need to create your own trail, break branches of trees and bushes, bending them to show the direction you're going. Make the signs clear and close together. It's wise to look back often and remember landmarks. To make a permanent trail, blaze trees with a hatchet, with one blaze away from camp and two toward it. Remember, two blazes mean ""camp on this side,"" and one blaze means ""away from camp on this side."" It's crucial to distinguish animal trails from human-made ones. Animals step over or around things, while humans step on them. Following an animal trail can lead to water, a bog, or even the animal's den. Always keep sight of your broken branches to find your way back."|['1. What does a woodsman use to mark his path in the woods?\nA) Rocks\nB) Leaves\nC) Chipped trees\nD) Flowers\nE) Grass', '2.

Learning to identify animal tracks and trees is essential for outdoor enthusiasts. The lynx leaves cat-like tracks without claw marks, while the mink's tracks resemble specific shapes. Rabbits' tracks consist of two large oblongs followed by round marks, indicating the hind feet lead with a unique gait. The direction of travel can be determined by the hind feet tracks. Recognizing the freshness of tracks helps estimate the animal's distance. The balsam-fir tree, similar to Christmas trees, emits a sweet aroma from flat needles with a twist at the base. The spruce tree, with sharp-pointed needles covering all sides, contrasts the balsam-fir. Spruce-gum can be found in the bark's seams and is sought after in early spring. Understanding these tracks and trees enriches outdoor experiences.|"['1.

In the forest, different trees offer various qualities. The cones of the gray pine are small, hanging down, and the wood is tough to split. The southern variety splits straight. The pine can provide pine-knots for fires. Each tree type has unique characteristics. Some woods are easy to split like spruce, chestnut, and balsam-fir. Others are strong like locust and oak. Knowing the trees' qualities is vital when camping or building shelters. When using a hatchet, be cautious. Always check the tool's condition before use. Avoid accidents by not raising sticks to eye level while chopping kindling-wood. Use a blunt hatchet end to break wood. Practice chopping small logs before trying heavier wood. Stand firmly when chopping and cut diagonally for easier work. Understanding each tree's abilities will help you use them effectively.|"['1.

When you start chopping a log, take it slow and easy. Don't rush and exhaust yourself. Begin by cutting down slender trees and saplings. As you gain skill, you can move on to slightly larger trees. Choose the direction you want the tree to fall and mark that side. Make sure the tree won't get stuck or fall on anything when it comes down. Clear the area around the tree to give your hatchet enough space to swing freely. Be cautious and avoid accidents. After marking the tree, chop out a notch on one side, then repeat on the other side. When the tree is ready to fall, step to the side and watch it come down. Always keep your hatchet in a safe place when not in use. Remember, it's important to respect nature and not disturb or take anything from the forest.|['1.

An essential part of woodcraft is navigating the wilderness using natural signs and a compass. To start, know the direction of your camp from where you are. Memorize landmarks around camp and note the wind and sun direction. In the morning, face the sun to find east. Pointing both arms out, your right finger is south, left is north, and back is west. Observe landmarks in each direction and the wind's origin. If the wind is west and you walk east, it should hit your back going away and face returning. Always mark your trail and look back at landmarks. Use the map, sun, shadows, wind, compass, and trail markings to stay on course. Check the sun's position for time and use a splinter or knife blade shadow on a surface to find the sun on cloudy days. Watch leaves or paper bits for wind direction and use a wet finger to sense wind changes while walking to avoid getting lost.|"['1.

When hiking and faced with sudden storm clouds obscuring the sun's shadows, using a compass becomes crucial for navigation. To effectively use a compass, hold it level in front of you and ensure it points north. Follow the direction indicated by the compass needle and select a distant landmark in that direction. Walk towards the landmark and periodically check the compass to stay on track. Practice using the compass until you are comfortable with it, allowing you to confidently trust its guidance. Additionally, a watch can serve as a makeshift compass by pointing the hour hand towards the sun; halfway between the hour hand and 12 indicates south. This knowledge can help you find your way back if you venture southeast or any other direction from camp. Remember to bring essential items like a staff, food, matches, a knife, camera, water, and a whistle for safety. Always take note of your surroundings and use landmarks to stay oriented.|['1.

When hiking in the mountains, you may encounter obstacles like big rocks or lakes that force you to change your path. To navigate such challenges, look for a distinct landmark before detouring, like a unique tree. Keep this landmark in sight to guide you back on track after circling the obstacle. In case of fog or rough terrain, link your hiking group with a rope for safety. Descend carefully by sidestepping to maintain a firm footing. If lost, stay calm, recall your route, and look for recognizable features. Use a whistle or make a signal with your handkerchief to alert your group. Remember to extinguish any fires you light for rescue. Blaze your trail with markers for others to follow and to help you retrace your steps.|['1.

If night falls upon you while camping, the _North Star_ can guide you back to your camp. Knowing your camp's direction relative to the compass can help you determine its location based on where you left. If you end up spending the night outdoors, build a shelter, create a comfortable resting place, and remain calm. It's better to stay put than risk getting lost in the dark. By marking the compass points using the _North Star_, you'll have a reference for daylight. The North Star, or Polaris, always points north, making it a vital tool for outdoor navigation. Face the North Star to find north, with east to your right, west to your left, and south behind you. The Big Dipper can assist in locating the North Star. When planning a camping trip, choose a suitable location with access to water, wood, and good ground. Ensure your campsite is dry and well-drained to avoid water accumulation. Always filter or boil water from natural sources before drinking to prevent illness. Lastly, select companions who embrace the camping spirit of teamwork and adventure, and consider having experienced adults join the group for guidance and safety.|"['1.

When camping, it's important to choose safe areas away from strangers and always stay with a group. If camping in the forest, having a knowledgeable guide is wise. Prepare everything the day before leaving to avoid delays and respect others' time. The thrill of exploring the wilderness, living outdoors, and engaging in activities contributes to a camper's health and joy. Even a one-day camp can be more fulfilling than other activities. Organize a clear schedule in advance for everyone to know their tasks upon arrival. Divide tasks among the group, like gathering firewood and setting up the campsite. Each camper should carry their pack with essentials like a tin cup. Keep meals simple and pack items like lamb chops, cocoa, bread, and maple sugar. After eating, share stories and ensure the campsite is clean for the next visitors. For longer stays, consider building a lean-to shelter using trees or poles for support.|"['1.

To construct a lean-to shelter, start by placing upright poles at least five feet above the ground. Lay a top pole across them, with five or six slender poles resting against it at regular intervals. These slant outward and backward, creating a slope for sleeping space underneath. Use natural pegs or stumps on the slanting poles to secure cross poles at right angles. Ensure the stumps face up to hold the cross poles in place. Cover the frame with bark and thatch for added protection. Begin thatching from the bottom, overlapping the branches like shingles. Fill in the sides with branches and boughs. For a more permanent camp, build a log lean-to with an open front, slanting roof, and a low back. Add a raised board floor covered with balsam for comfort. Finish the roof with boards or thatched poles overlaid with bark.|['1.

When camping in an area without materials for a bough-bed, each girl can bring a bag made of sturdy cloth to be filled with leaves or grass for a comfortable mattress. Ensure the bag is well-filled to avoid it becoming flat and hard when lying on it. For a pillow, make a bag from brown linen and fill it with browse or clean underwear if needed. Side trips for overnight camping can be exciting, but ensure the sleeping spot is clear of twigs and stones for a good night's rest. Rotate watch duties throughout the night to enjoy the sounds of nature and keep the camp safe. Start a fire in an open area with dry leaves or twigs, and use soft woods like pine or birch to keep it burning steadily. Hardwoods like hickory are best for a long-lasting fire with hot coals.

To start a fire outdoors, follow these steps. Begin by creating a grate using slender kindling sticks across the two upper large sticks. Then, place larger sticks at right angles over the grate, layering them to form a log-cabin structure about one foot high. Light the fire from beneath the tinder pile. If it's raining and you can't find dry wood, stay positive and search for pine-knots or birch bark near a dead stump. Pine-knots work well in wet conditions. To build an outdoor fireplace, lay two green logs in a V-shape on the ground, leaving an open space for the fire in the middle. For cooking, place a frying pan and water pail on top of the logs over the fire. Always be cautious about forest fires by ensuring the fire is completely out before leaving the site.|"['1.

In camp, a sturdy fireplace is essential for warmth and cooking. The fireplace is made of large green logs, stones, and earth, ensuring it lasts for many seasons. Logs are stacked like a log cabin, filled with earth and stones to secure them. Big stones line the top, raising the back higher than the front. The space inside is filled with earth, where the fire is built. If a permanent fireplace is not available, a large cook-fire can serve as a social gathering spot. It's important to have plenty of firewood on hand, replenishing it daily and keeping it dry. For meals, simple flapjacks and biscuits can be easily made over the fire. Flapjacks are cooked in a pan, while biscuits can be baked or spiraled around a stick and cooked over the fire. Watch carefully to avoid burning them.|['1.

When cleaning woolen undergarments, use cool, soapy water with a bit of borax or ammonia. Avoid rubbing the soap directly on the wool to prevent shrinking. Instead of rubbing, gently squeeze and soak the garments, then rinse in water of the same temperature. Do not wring out the items; simply squeeze excess water and hang them to dry. Changing water temperatures can cause wool to shrink, so stick to either cold or lukewarm water. For hiking, wear low-heeled, high-laced leather shoes. Waterproof them by applying melted mutton tallow. Test the shoes before the trip to ensure comfort. Your middy-blouse should have pockets for essentials like a watch and compass. The skirt should be short for ease and wide for mobility, with seam pockets and the ability to convert into a cape. Opt for a lightweight felt hat with a wide brim and avoid hatpins. Pack light for the woods, considering that you will carry your belongings. Include only necessary items, as everything adds weight. Additionally, bring a warm sweater and snug leggings without buttons for hiking.|['1.

When possible, it's a good idea to pack your smaller items in wall-pockets with compartments secured by flaps over the open ends. Roll these pockets, tie them, and place them in your camp pack. These pockets are handy at camp and help you keep your things organized. Alternatively, you can use small labeled bags for different types of belongings and place them in tube-shaped duffel bags. These bags can be tied together to form one pack. Girls usually carry between eighteen to twenty-four pounds, depending on their strength and endurance. Avoid overloading yourself, as packs get heavier on the trail. For short overnight trips from camp, you can carry essential items in your blanket-roll. Arrange your items on the blankets, roll them tightly, and wear the blanket-roll diagonally across your back and chest. Items for general use at camp can be packed in duffel bags, with provisions ideally in a separate bag. Consider using labeled tube bags of the same diameter for different food items, all stored in a larger duffel bag. Camp packs like duffel bags, harnesses, and tump-lines can be purchased at outfitters. For a wilderness camp, guides may be needed to help with carrying due to the lack of vehicles or animals. Despite the challenges, camping in the wilderness offers unique experiences and opportunities for crafting useful items from natural materials found in the surroundings.

To create useful items in the wilderness, girls can fashion birch-bark dinnerware like plates, dishes, baskets, and dippers. Soak the bark to soften it, then cut it to size and scrape off the outer bark around the edges. Use the first plate as a template for the others. Various shapes like circular, oblong, and rectangular can be crafted from strips and pieces of birch bark. These dishes can also be turned into baskets by adding handles. When sewing the bark edges, ensure it is wet and soft, lap the edges, and use a coarse needle with twine. Finish by coating the stitching with hot melted grease mixed with spruce gum or white-birch resin. Additionally, create essential tools like pot-hooks and candle holders using simple materials found in nature.

"If you wish to observe the birds in the forest, listen for their calls and quietly follow the sounds to locate them. Move between trees cautiously, pausing if you think the birds might spot you, until you can hide behind a bush or tree to watch them. Sometimes, you may need to kneel to stay out of sight. The male grouse's drumming call will lead you to him, and you may see his mate joining him. The ""whit-kwit"" call could guide you to the hen grouse and her chicks, blending in with the surroundings. The ruffed grouse is a striking bird with yellowish-brown plumage and dark markings, while the woodcock has a long bill and short legs. Beavers, muskrats, otters, and fishers can be spotted near water bodies, each fascinating in their habits. Beavers build distinct lodges near the shore with stripped bark, best observed at dusk.

The sweet viburnum tree, also known as nanny-berry or sheepberry, bears edible fruit. This small tree belongs to the honeysuckle family and can be found in wooded areas and near streams from Canada to Georgia and as far west as Missouri. Its bark is rusty and scaly, with broad oval leaves that are finely toothed and pointed at the tip. The flower clusters are large and appear yellowish due to the many yellow anthers at the center. The dark blue or black fruit, covered with a bloom, ripens in September and October. The tree also has thorns that are edible, and the fruit is sweet and apple-like, growing on hairy stems with hard, rounded seeds inside. The black haw shrub, which can grow into a small tree, produces oval dark blue fruit that becomes edible after frost. It has cream-white flowers in flat-topped clusters and is found in forests from Connecticut to Georgia and west to the Indian Territory. Another fruit-bearing plant is the Canada plum, which grows along fences, in thickets, and by streams in New England and Canada.

The tree typically stands between thirty to fifty feet tall, with reports of it reaching even one hundred feet in certain areas. Its trunk is short and its branches spread out. In the southern regions, it often forms thickets in uncultivated fields and along roadsides. The bark is dark brown or dark gray, with a scaly surface divided into plates. The leaves are narrow ovals with smooth edges, dark green and glossy on top, and pale and sometimes downy underneath when mature. The flower is creamy-white or greenish-yellow. Another fruit I was familiar with as a child is the papaw, also known as custard-apple due to its soft custard-like flesh. The papaw resembles a banana in shape but is shorter and thicker, usually three to five inches long. It ripens in September and October, found as far south as Florida and Texas, through the Middle States to Michigan and Kansas. The May-apple, or mandrake, is a delicious wild fruit, sweet and juicy but best eaten sparingly due to its laxative properties. It is most common in the Middle States and reaches its peak in Ohio.

In midsummer, cream-white blossoms adorn the tree's branches, making it easy to spot. The tree's leaves are large, toothed, and veined, drooping from a central point. On the other hand, the _slippery-elm_ tree is recognized by its glutinous inner bark and root, offering a nutty flavor. This tree grows up to seventy feet with spreading branches resembling a champagne glass. Its leaves are oblong and toothed, with a fragrant inner bark and rough texture in all directions. Lastly, the _sassafras_ tree, found from Massachusetts to Florida, boasts dark red-brown bark and aromatic qualities in its bark, wood, roots, stems, and leaves. The tree's fruit is berry-like, attracting birds with its glossy, dark blue appearance.|"['1.

The Adirondack and North Woods area is popular for outdoor activities, but it's also home to pesky insects like the black-fly. This tiny fly, also known as the buffalo-fly in the west, is about one-sixth of an inch long, black, and has a proboscis to draw blood. It can be a nuisance from early spring until mid-July or August. Another tiny pest is the no-see-um, a minuscule midge similar to a mosquito but almost invisible. They are active day and night and disappear with the black-fly. To relieve bites from these insects, applying camphor, alcohol, or diluted ammonia can help. In Pennsylvania mountains, gnats can be bothersome by flying into eyes, but they can be easily removed by pulling the upper eyelid over the lower one. Bees and wasps can also be troublesome, especially hornets that sting fiercely. If stung, remove the stinger and apply mud to reduce inflammation. Dopes like Nessmuk's Dope can also repel insects when applied to the skin.|"[""1.

Pennsylvania's mountains are a known habitat for the banded rattlesnake, with its yellowish color and dark brown bands. Despite spending summers in Pike County, where snakes are famous, encounters were rare. Weekend guests attempted to hunt rattlesnakes for their skins without success. The copperhead, often mistaken for a rattlesnake due to its vibrating tail, is highly poisonous, found in rocky areas and forests from New England to Texas. The harlequin and coral snakes, with bright coral-red, yellow, and black stripes, are southern species, while the water-moccasin, with its thick, unattractive body and menacing appearance, is found in wetlands. These snakes exhibit unique colors and patterns, making them easily identifiable in their habitats.|['1.

The moccasin snake found in the southern regions of the United States does not coil before attacking. Instead, it vibrates its tail slowly and keeps its mouth open while hunting. It is commonly spotted near bayous and swamps, either partially submerged in water or resting on logs and branches over water. The moccasin's bite is highly venomous, making it a dangerous snake. However, most snakes in the U.S. are non-venomous. Remember, snakes with lengthwise stripes running from head to tail are harmless. Snakes like the blacksnake may look intimidating but are non-venomous. It is unnecessary and cruel to kill every snake encountered just because it is a snake. When identifying venomous snakes like the rattlesnake, copperhead, and cottonmouth, look for the pit, a distinct cavity between the nostrils and eyes. If bitten by a venomous snake, immediate first aid is crucial, including slashing the wound and sucking out the poison if there are no mouth injuries.|['1.

Some suggest using a hot iron to cauterize a wound, but act swiftly and _without fear_. Fear can harm the patient and spread. Remember, a snake bite is rarely deadly, and a swollen limb doesn't mean it's hopeless. While we might assume everyone knows poison ivy, that's not always true. Once, a city visitor unknowingly carried the vine, risking poisoning. We warned her, and she dropped it and hurried off. Some are immune to ivy, luckily including me. Others are sensitive, possibly due to fear. Poison oak looks like ivy but has oval leaves with blunt teeth. Poison sumac, found in wet areas, has gray berries, unlike harmless sumac. Remedies like witch-hazel, baking soda paste, or alcohol can help. Yellow lady's-slipper, a sweet orchid, can affect some like poison ivy.|"[""1.

The plant known as pokeweed is a tall annual with dark green triangular leaves that have wavy edges. It produces white flowers in clusters and black, smooth berries that grow at the end of drooping stems. Although birds eat its berries and its young shoots are said to taste like asparagus, it is a poisonous plant. The root is the most toxic part, and it is essential not to mistake it for edible plants. Another poisonous plant to be cautious of is poison-hemlock, historically known for its role in Socrates's death. Its stem is smooth and purplish-red, with large parsley-like leaves and small white flowers. Jimson-weed, a smelly plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in various colors, is common across the United States and can be harmful if its seeds are ingested.|"['1.

To capture fast-moving objects like flying birds in photographs, you need a camera with a fast shutter speed, ideally at least one three-hundredths of a second. However, good pictures of moderately moving subjects can be taken with a speed of one one-hundredth of a second. For animals walking or running slowly, a shutter speed of one one-hundredth is sufficient. It's important to know your camera's capabilities to avoid wasting film on shots beyond its limits. When photographing wildlife, patience is key. Find a spot frequented by the animal, set up your camera like a trap, and wait for the creature to return naturally. Ensure your camera is focused on the right spot and secure it on a stable stand. Use a long cord to release the shutter from your hiding place. Be calm, act swiftly when the animal is in focus, and avoid jerking the cord too hard. With practice, you'll improve your wildlife photography skills and capture amazing shots worth the effort.|"['1.

One company that provides camping gear promotes a canoe named the Sponson, which features air-chambers called sponsons along the outside rail. The design of these air-chambers is said to make the canoe nearly impossible to capsize, even when filled with water, and capable of supporting heavy loads. Sponsons can be bought separately and adjusted to fit various canoe sizes. For beginners, sponsons offer safety and ease in learning to paddle without fear of tipping over. Additionally, there are guide canoes specifically designed for hunting and fishing, known for their sturdiness, flat bottoms, ability to carry heavy loads, ease of paddling or poling, and stability in rough waters. Prices for quality canoes typically range from twenty-eight to forty dollars, with higher prices not necessarily indicating better quality. Paddles made of different woods like red oak, maple, ash, spruce, and cherry are available in various lengths, with spruce preferred for regular use and harder woods recommended for rough waters. Care for canoes is crucial, including proper lifting, storage, and maintenance to prevent damage. When entering a canoe, it should be brought parallel to the shore, stepping in carefully to maintain balance and using the paddle for support if needed. Balancing and cautious movements are essential in canoeing to avoid tipping over. Changing positions while in the canoe is not recommended; instead, it's advised to land and switch positions on the shore if necessary.|['1.

If your canoe tips over, hold onto your paddle to help you stay afloat. Try to reach your canoe and hold onto it without climbing on top until help arrives or you can swim to shore. It's important to know how to swim, especially if you're often on the trail. Some experts suggest kneeling in the canoe while paddling, as it gives you better control and stability. When paddling, hold the paddle with one hand at the end and the other around the handle, dip it into the water in front of you, and sweep it backward toward the stern. Remember to face the bow of the canoe and switch sides while paddling for balance. Loading your canoe properly is crucial to prevent it from tipping over. When rowing, your body does most of the work, and steering is done by pulling harder on the oar opposite to the direction you want to go. With practice, paddling and rowing will become second nature, just like riding a bike.|['1.

To build a raft, notch the outer logs for the ropes to pass over, preventing them from slipping. Cut two thinner logs for the ends, extending slightly beyond each side. Secure a rope with a slip knot to one end, wrapping it over and under the logs, forming a cross on top. For a mini raft, use small, straight branches and weave a rope around them. To pole the raft, choose a long, smooth pole for pushing from the bottom in deep water. Stand near the edge when poling, keeping balance. In calm water, pole to steer or let the current guide you. Avoid swift currents and use shallow, calm waters. Remember, your body is buoyant, so stay calm and avoid struggling while learning to swim.

Learning to swim can be a fun and rewarding experience. Various devices have been created to help people stay afloat while swimming, but they can sometimes hinder confidence. The best way to learn is to have a friend support you by placing a hand under your chin and walking with you in the water. This method provides a sense of security and allows you to practice swimming movements confidently. Remember that it's the feeling of being supported that matters most. Starting in shallow water with a friend or in quiet waters alone is ideal. By practicing the right movements, like extending your arms and kicking your legs, you can learn to swim effectively. It's also important to know how to float, as it can be a valuable skill in water safety. Stay safe by avoiding diving into unknown or shallow waters. If you need to dive, follow proper techniques to ensure a safe entry into the water.|['1. What is the recommended method for learning how to swim effectively in the text?\nA.

When swimming, always remember to breathe through your nose and avoid opening your mouth to prevent swallowing water. Exhale as you reach your hands forward and inhale as you bring them back. Treading water is like running up stairs quickly, mimicking the leg movement. To maintain balance in water, spread your arms at your sides and keep your head back. Fishing can be done in various ways, such as using a fishing rod with a fly or a simple pole with an angleworm. Remember not to catch more fish than you need to preserve fishing spots for others. Learning to fish from an experienced person is essential, along with owning good fishing equipment. Enjoy fishing responsibly and respect nature by only taking what you need.|['1.

When learning how to tie knots, understanding the different bends is crucial. There are three main types: the bight, the loop, and the round turn. The bight is created by bending the rope so that the sides are parallel. The loop is made by lapping one rope of the bight across the other. The round turn involves carrying one rope of the loop all the way around to the other side, making half of the loop double. One common knot is the square knot, which starts with a single tie where one end goes over the other and then under it. Then, the ends are brought together, and the same end goes over the other once more. This creates a secure square knot. Another useful knot is the figure-eight knot, which is great for securing the end of a rope or preventing strands from untwisting.|['1.

"When you need to create a loop without securing it to anything, use the overhand method of tying. First, measure enough rope for the loop and mark the spot with your left hand. Next, throw the short end over the long rope with your right hand. Then, bring the long rope up to form a loop over the end with your left hand. Pass the end through the loop and behind the long rope above the loop from right to left. Finally, slip the end downward through the loop, tighten the knot, and it won't slip even under strain. 

For loops passed around something or through a ring, like when hitching a horse or cow, use the underhand method. Slip the rope through the ring from left to right while holding the long rope in your left hand. Take a half-hitch around the long rope, passing the end over and under it. Transfer the loop from the short rope to the long rope by pulling up with the right hand. Tighten the knot by pulling on both the long rope and the short end. 

The sheep-shank knot is handy for temporarily shortening a rope without cutting it. Sailors use it to withstand strain without slipping. To tie it, bend the rope to form two bights, then carry the single rope over at the top of the bend and under to form a half-hitch. Repeat with the other single rope at the bottom of the bend and draw both ends tight. If you need to shorten the rope"|['1.

One of the simplest knots to start with when tying up a parcel is the single-tie knot. Begin by making a knot about an inch from the end of your twine, using the single tie like _F_ (Fig. 65). If the knot isn't large enough, use the figure-eight knot. Wrap your twine around the parcel once, overlapping the long twine over the knotted end. Bring the knotted end over the long twine, forming a bight, then over and under its own twine with the single tie (_H_). Tighten the tie close to the knot to prevent slipping. To secure the cross-line, loop the long twine under the first twine to form a bight (_I_, Fig. 66). Finish by tying it securely to the first twine where it began. The fisherman's knot is used to tie silkworm gut together, easily untied by pulling the short ends. For a temporary fastening, use a timber-hitch.|"[""1.

While hiking, it's crucial to prevent accidents, but being prepared for emergencies is equally important. For sprains and bruises, apply hot water-soaked cloths to reduce soreness and inflammation. If hot water isn't available, cold water can be used. In case of a sprained ankle or wrist, continue the hot water treatment and then wrap with a clean bandage. To carry an injured person using the fireman's lift, have them relax their muscles, lift them to their feet, and carry them away. For minor cuts, clean the wound, press the sides together, and use strips of plaster to keep it closed. In case of a serious cut on an artery, apply pressure above the wound and use a tourniquet to stop bleeding, but remember not to keep it on for more than an hour to avoid cutting off circulation.|"['1.

In the event of an accident, call for medical help promptly. If a doctor is not nearby, transport the injured person to the closest medical professional to address the issue of the artery needing to be tied urgently. Moving the patient on foot is not advisable due to the risk of re-bleeding, so it's essential to create an improvised stretcher using two sturdy poles, a large blanket, and safety pins. If blankets are unavailable, cut a khaki skirt into strips to fashion a makeshift stretcher. For burns, avoid using oil or flour; instead, cool the affected area with running water to alleviate pain and prevent further damage. In case of fainting, ensure the person lies flat with raised feet, provide fresh air, and apply cold water while seeking medical help. If something gets in the eye, avoid inserting anything hard; use eyelashes to clean the eye or seek professional assistance if needed. If someone is rescued from water and not breathing, focus on restoring respiration before addressing warmth and circulation.|['1.

First, quickly loosen the clothes at the waist and neck. Then, turn the patient face downward on the ground with arms extended above the head, chest raised slightly, and face either downward or turned to one side. Place something beneath the forehead to raise the nose and mouth from the ground, allowing the tongue to fall forward. If needed, grasp the tongue with a handkerchief and pull forward to permit water to run out for breathing. Remember, in cases of drowning, the patient needs all the air possible. Avoid crowds forming around; keep only those assisting nearby. Continue the treatment until the breath comes naturally. Rub the limbs upward with firm pressure to restore circulation. Provide warmth with heated blankets and hot stones. Keep the patient quiet and let them sleep after the treatment. Camp fun is essential for a lively camp environment. Competitive sports like races can be exciting and entertaining. Consider organizing races with unique challenges to keep everyone engaged and amused.|"['1.

In a camp, fun activities await! For the winner of a race, a medal can be crafted from a tin can lid. Simply drive a nail through it, attach a string, and hang it around the neck. Alternatively, crown the victor with a leafy wreath, a nod to ancient Greek traditions. Another exciting game is the blindfold obstacle walk. Set up stones with cups of water on top, two feet apart. Blindfold a player, have guards guide her hands, and challenge her to navigate the stones without spilling. This game is similar to hide-and-seek, where players hide and the hunter tries to find them. Lastly, try wood tennis using pine cones as balls, hands as rackets, and branches as a net on a court outlined in the earth. Enjoy these outdoor games!|['1.

In the woods, playing tennis with wood and pine-cones is a fun twist. Instead of rackets, players toss the cones over a net and catch them, then toss them back. When night falls, campers gather around a campfire for warmth and companionship. Men share trail stories, while girls and women also contribute tales. Singing songs with impromptu verses and a catchy chorus adds to the fun. A bird-call match challenges players to identify bird calls correctly, honing woodcraft skills. Lighting a fire without matches in a contest showcases outdoor expertise.

To start a fire using primitive tools, you need a bow, a twirling-stick, and a fireboard. The twirling-stick should be made of spruce, about sixteen inches long and a little over half an inch in diameter. Cut the top end to a blunt point and sharpen the bottom end. Use a socket-block made of soapstone or hard wood to hold the spindle. The fireboard should be about two feet long and less than an inch thick, with triangular notches on one edge for the twirling-stick. These notches create a fire pit. Prepare tinder from baked and blackened cotton and linen rags, ensuring they are absolutely dry. Use the bow to twirl the spindle on the fireboard rapidly to create friction and heat, which will produce a spark to ignite the tinder for a flame.|['1.

Fig. 78 illustrates a technique similar to Fig. 77, but without the bow. Instead, hands are used to spin the spindle. This method, while simpler, requires considerable effort and speed to create fire, making it a challenging and tiring process. Another approach, as depicted in Fig. 79, involves two individuals. One girl holds the spindle and stabilizes the fireboard, while the other pulls a leather shoe-string back and forth to rotate the spindle. Producing fire using the plough method is more complex than with a bow but achievable. All that is needed is a fireboard with a groove and a rubbing-stick (Fig. 80). A fire-saw can be fashioned from an old bamboo fishing-rod. By cutting and sharpening the bamboo, sparks can be created by sawing through it. This method requires coordination between two individuals, one holding the bamboo steady while the other saws (Fig. 81). By placing tinder on a dry leaf and fanning the sparks, a flame can be ignited. Planning engaging activities for camp Sundays is crucial to ensure everyone enjoys the day to the fullest.
