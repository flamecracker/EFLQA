"Title: Charlie Carstairs: The Adventures of a Young Spy

Charlie Carstairs, a brave youth, found himself entangled in the thrilling escapades of Charles the Twelfth of Sweden.

The story unfolds in Lynnwood, a fortified mansion, where Sir Marmaduke Carstairs reminisces about the Civil War's tumultuous times. Despite regretting the house's lack of fortification, Sir Marmaduke's childhood defiance against Roundhead soldiers remains a vivid memory.

Sir Marmaduke regretted that Lynnwood wasn't fortified, but believed in fighting for a chance of success. At the Restoration, he visited London to honor Charles II. Loyal to the Stuarts, he rejoiced at Monmouth's defeat and was angry when James fled. Sir Marmaduke became a strong Jacobite, ready for the king's return. In 1696, a Jacobite plot failed, angering him. He opposed a plot to assassinate the king, denouncing such treachery. Sir Marmaduke advised his son, Charlie, to fight openly for the Stuarts and avoid dishonorable schemes. Charlie, aged thirteen, pledged to uphold the Jacobite cause. He defended King James' honor and was prepared to duel for it. Sir Marmaduke supported his son's actions against a cousin who insulted the king. He valued honor in combat and warned against political deceit.|"['1.

Sir Marmaduke advised John Dormay to focus on his own son's behavior instead of criticizing Alured. He mentioned that during Alured's last visit, his manners were deteriorating, lacking respect for elders. Sir Marmaduke suggested that like Charlie, who had an hour of sword exercise daily, Alured needed guidance. He emphasized the importance of Alured having the manners and skills expected of young men in their social circle. John Dormay, though hesitant, agreed to help Alured improve his behavior. Sir Marmaduke, although displeased with John's reaction, hoped for a positive change. He found John's behavior questionable, especially his acquisition of farms through dubious means, causing discontent among the locals. Despite political differences, Sir Marmaduke believed that John's conduct, rather than his affiliations, was the root of the issue.|"[""1.

Sir Marmaduke was pleased that Charlie had stood up for Alured, but he knew Charlie needed a talking to. Charlie's father shared the full story, revealing more than just a few exchanged blows. Sir Marmaduke understood the need for caution. He realized that if Charlie reacted to every slight against the king, he could get into serious trouble. The political climate was tense, and it was best to stay quiet until the right moment. Meanwhile, plans for the Jacobites were at a standstill. Despite failed plots, William's support grew as people rejected violent means. At Lynnwood, life went on as usual. Charlie focused on his studies, fencing, and riding. He also visited Rockley to bring back his cousin, Ciceley, whom he enjoyed spending time with.|"[""1.

"""You will understand all about it later, son,"" his father assured. ""You're too young to worry about politics; you'd get impatient quickly. Even I do, now and then. Many who talk boldly when there's no action retreat when the time for action nears. It's frustrating to hear the fearful objections and weak arguments. Here I am, sixty years old, ready to risk all for the cause, while many younger ones speak cautiously. But I believe things will resolve themselves. The most anxious time is before a battle starts. Once it begins, fear fades. Every loyal man will rise to the cause when the king lands, and England will unite. Charlie didn't bother much about this. He knew he'd ride by his father's side when the time came. One day, while in the garden with Ciceley, a servant came with a message from his father.

""Well, it is this. That man comes over sometimes to see my father. I have seen him pass my window, three or four times, and go in by the garden door into father's study. I did not know who he was, but it did seem funny his entering by that door, as if he did not want to be seen by anyone in the house. I did not think anything more about it, till I saw him just now, then I knew him directly. If I had seen him before, I should have told you at once, but I don't think I have.""

""I daresay not, Ciceley. He does not wait at table, but is under the steward, and helps clean the silver. He waits when we have several friends to dinner. At other times he does not often come into the room.""

It would not be wise to inform my father about Ciceley's words. He might forcibly remove the man and cause harm, leading back to her. Her home life is already unhappy, and it would worsen if her father knew she warned us. I need to investigate discreetly so we can expel him without implicating Ciceley. Charlie suspected the spy would eavesdrop from a window. He armed himself and stealthily approached the shrubbery by the room's side window. When the man appeared, Charlie swiftly struck him down. His father arrived, and a chase ensued, but the spy escaped. Charlie identified the man by his cap and a cut with blood on it.

Harry Jervoise, Charlie's best friend, shared his loyalty to the Stuarts. They spent the day together, visiting the stables, playing bowls, and sword fighting. They dreamt of the return of their rightful king. Despite their opposition to the Dutch king, they had no violent intentions. Sir Marmaduke was wrongly accused of plotting against the king. Officials searched his house, finding incriminating letters in his cabinet. Sir Marmaduke denied any knowledge of the letters and was taken into custody.

Charles was certain his father, Sir Marmaduke, was unaware of the letters or any plot against William. Despite Sir Marmaduke's known opposition to assassination and its damaging effects on their cause, the papers incriminating him were a mystery. The old butler, Banks, suspected it was a setup by Sir Marmaduke's enemies due to his Jacobite ties. Charles feared the false accusations could lead to their estate being confiscated. Banks advised Charles not to be captured but to think strategically to help his father. Charles decided to seek advice and warned Mr. Jervoise of the looming threat.

A short while after Mr. Jervoise rode away, his son Harry and his friend Charlie also got on their horses. They were joined by a man carrying torches, as it was a dark and rainy night, making it hard to see the path. They were grateful for the precaution as the sky was cloudy and there was no moon. The torches were lit, and it took them over two hours to reach the mountain farm where they were expected. The warmth of a fire and a warm welcome awaited them. Harry and Charlie, soaked from the rain, had a hot drink and quickly went to bed. They woke up to a sunny morning, feeling more hopeful. Harry left for home, promising to return with any news. Charlie took a walk in the hills and upon his return, received news that officials had come to arrest Mr. Jervoise.

The next year, Charles of Sweden, who had recently taken over from his father, provided the duke with troops to construct forts safeguarding the border from a potential Danish invasion. However, Christian of Denmark swiftly seized and destroyed these forts. Due to his weakened state, the duke refrained from retaliating, and negotiations continued. Concerned about the situation, the Swedish Diet gathered in Stockholm for the late king's funeral and to address the circumstances. Despite the late king's will, which delayed Charles's ascension until he turned eighteen, the Diet voted to crown him immediately. Subsequently, Charles solidified alliances with France, England, and Holland, while Denmark allegedly formed a secret coalition with Poland and Russia against Sweden. Charles, unaware of these alliances, dispatched envoys to Russia, unaware of the brewing conflicts. Meanwhile, Denmark's naval buildup prompted the Duke of Holstein to fortify Tonningen against potential aggression.|"['1.

Mr. Jervoise and his companions were eager to recruit men for their regiment. They advised the young lads to head to the wharves early in the morning to find potential recruits who had recently arrived but were held back due to the language barrier. The plan was to offer the newcomers a free outfit to join their Scottish company. The next day, the lads went to the wharf and overheard three Scottish men discussing their desire to join a regiment where they could communicate in their native language. Harry, the son of Mr. Jervoise, approached them with an offer to join his father's regiment, which had both Scottish and English members. Excited about the prospect, the Scottish men enlisted, and soon, more recruits joined. With their arms and gear ready, they set off to the camp in Malmoe, led by Captain Jervoise.

For the next two weeks, the soldiers practiced drills diligently under the guidance of their officers and sergeants. They learned the commands and movements required for battle. After this training period, both officers and soldiers were ready for action. The English and Dutch fleets had joined forces with Sweden, while the Danish fleet remained blockaded in Copenhagen. The King of Denmark, realizing the strength of the opposing forces, agreed to peace terms. This allowed King Charles the Twelfth to focus on other threats. He swiftly mobilized his troops to aid Riga and Narva against the Saxons, Poles, and Russians. Despite facing challenges like illness and limited supplies, the soldiers remained eager for battle. The king's decision to advance without waiting for reinforcements surprised many, but his determination to engage the enemy was unwavering.|"['1.

Captain Jervoise and his men marched towards Narva, a distant seventy miles away, through devastated lands where villagers had fled. With only three days' provisions, they knew they had to rely on the Russian camp for food. Despite the worn-out cavalry, there was a determination to fight. The troops encountered Russian foragers and, led by King Charles, attacked and won, securing a pass. The soldiers rested, replenished their supplies, and continued towards Narva. The exhausted troops reached Lagena, close to Narva, where they prepared to face the Russian forces. Many soldiers were fatigued, but some officers, like Major Jamieson, believed an immediate attack was their best chance against the formidable enemy.|"['1.

The king believed the Swedish army could surprise the Russians by attacking swiftly. The troops advanced towards the Russian camp, facing enemy fire. The king led the assault, dividing the troops into two columns. The Swedish forces managed to breach the enemy's defenses despite the harsh weather. The Russians were caught off guard and the Swedes quickly gained ground. The Russian troops panicked and fled towards the river, causing chaos. The Swedish king led a charge, cutting down many Russians. As darkness fell, the battle continued fiercely, but the Russians defended themselves bravely. Ultimately, the assault ceased, with the outcome still uncertain.|"['1.

The king decided not to directly attack the Russian defenses due to the high potential for loss. Instead, he strategically positioned his army between the town and the Russian intrenchments to defend against a possible Russian offensive. At dawn, the Swedes assaulted the hill where the enemy's main battery was located, a crucial position that commanded all Russian intrenchments. The Russian right wing, unable to cross the river and surrounded by the Swedes, surrendered. The Swedish Guards took control, allowing the Russians to retreat with their arms but not their standards. The broken bridge was fixed, and the Russian troops crossed over. The left wing, hopeless after the surrender of the right, also surrendered. The Swedes achieved a remarkable victory with minimal casualties compared to the Russians, capturing significant resources and prisoners. The king, who showed remarkable bravery throughout the battle, emerged unscathed. The unexpected snowstorm played a crucial role in the victory, catching the Russians off guard and causing panic among their ranks.|"['1.

The wounded and sick were sent to the town first, followed by the triumphant entry of the king and his staff, cheered by the grateful townspeople saved from ruin. The town, though fortified, was too small to house all the troops, so many stayed in Russian huts. A thanksgiving service was held on the 26th. Provisions were scarce due to the devastated land. Major Jamieson warned of tough times ahead with illness and inaction. The army moved to Lais, where a fever spread due to harsh conditions. The king worked tirelessly to boost morale, promising better days in the spring.|"[""1.

At Narva, the four young officers bought horses. Most Swedish officers rode, encouraged by the king to swiftly gather a mounted group for missions. However, their colonel preferred lieutenants and ensigns to march on foot with their men, setting an example of endurance. Those who desired horses could have them, led behind the regiment. The colonel believed riding would improve health in winter, offering officers a chance to join expeditions and break camp monotony. Riding helped, though forage was scarce. The regiment was near Marienburg, vulnerable to Russian attacks. Captain Jervoise organized games for the company, keeping them healthy. Colonel Schlippenbach commended Jervoise's efforts. In January, they fortified Marienburg to thwart the Saxons. Captain Jervoise's company aided in the fortification, showing their strength and vigor.|"['1.

Captain Jervoise's troops, part of Baron Spens' force, marched to attack a Russian camp. The surprise assault led to fierce fighting with the Russians, who barricaded themselves in the town. The Livonian peasants set fire to the town, causing chaos. Despite the success, the Swedish forces faced challenges storming a convent on a hill due to lack of artillery. The troops, hesitant to harm the Russians, withdrew with minimal casualties. Harry and his friend Charlie reflected on the grim nature of the conflict, preferring direct combat over surprise attacks. Meanwhile, King Charles XII planned a strategic move against the Russians, aiming to push them back from the frontier.

My favorite group is mostly made up of Scotsmen, with a few Englishmen among them. They are part of the Malmoe Regiment, led by Captain Jervoise, who is English. These soldiers may not be braver than our Swedes, but they are hardier and healthier. Since the battle of Narva, their officers have kept them active with sports like mock battles and foot races. I have observed their rough play and seen the positive impact it has had. While other troops suffered from fever, hardly anyone in this company fell ill. They have remained strong and ready for tough tasks all winter. One day, as they were preparing dinner, they were called to attention by Captain Jervoise. To their surprise, the troops lined up in front of their quarters, and the officers stood before them, awaiting orders. Soon, the king arrived and inspected the men closely, commending Captain Jervoise for keeping his soldiers healthy through sports.

Captain Jervoise, the king, and his officers discussed the importance of having a strong monarch for England. They debated the qualities needed in a ruler, with the king favoring a military monarch like William of Orange. The king organized a hunting party with the men to enclose wolves and bears in a forest. The beaters were positioned strategically to create a semicircle to drive the game towards the center. As the beaters closed in, distant shots signaled the animals trying to break through. The beaters met at a common point after successfully encircling the game.

The king swiftly led his cavalry against the Russian forces, outnumbered but undeterred. Amid the chaos, the cavalry unleashed a volley and engaged in close combat with their pikes. As the infantry pushed forward, Charlie valiantly fought, only to be knocked unconscious and taken prisoner. He awoke in Plescow, the sole captive, where a Russian officer chided his comrade for missing the chance to capture the king. The officer's failure led to his demotion by the czar.

I've been fortunate in my circumstances. The czar's service is excellent, and many Scots, including General Gordon, hold key positions thanks to their aid in securing the throne for the czar. My father is in Sweden, and my company is led by a man I look up to like a father, with his son being like a brother to me. I recently sat by a campfire with King Charles, and I couldn't bear to fight against him. The czar shoulders the weight of Russia, striving to better the country despite facing resistance. He's dedicated to learning and self-improvement, from anatomy to military tactics. While facing challenges, including insurrections and defeats, the czar persists in his mission to modernize Russia. His determination is admirable, even if he has his flaws. I must go attend to the wounded now, but we'll have a proper dinner later. Don't worry about the food they bring you.

My friends serve in the Swedish army, and I am pleased with their service. If Russia were closer to England, we might have joined the czar's service eagerly like we did with King Charles. People say the czar welcomes foreigners and treats his loyal servants well. I cannot judge the conflict between them, but it seems unfair for Russia to attack Sweden during its conflicts with Denmark and Saxony. Doctor Michaeloff explains that nations act more out of self-interest than morality, like individuals. He mentions that officers must prioritize their men over themselves.

At eight o'clock, Charlie had a bowl of broth before descending to the courtyard with an officer, two soldiers, and the doctor. There, a Swedish officer from the king's personal staff awaited him. The Russian officer handed Charlie over, ensuring his safe return from Revel, where he was interned. The Swedish officer promised to deliver Charlie safely and to return another officer of equal rank if unable to do so. The Russian conveyed the czar's regret for any mistreatment and assured that all Swedish officers would be treated well in the future. Before leaving, Charlie thanked Doctor Kelly for his kindness and hoped to repay it someday. The officer shared a conversation with the czar, who spoke courteously of the king and hinted at turning the tables in the future. Charlie's return was a relief as there were fears he had been badly injured, but the search revealed he was alive and taken by Cossacks.

When I arrived in Plescow yesterday, I was relieved to hear that your wound is not severe. The doctor, who happened to be from your homeland, reassured me that it was minor, even making a joke about the toughness of North Country skulls. Later, I met the czar in the evening after he arrived in the afternoon. He was initially furious, scolding the general for not treating you hospitably while imprisoned. The czar emphasized the importance of treating prisoners with respect and kindness, unlike the treatment you received. He even relieved the general of his duties due to this incident. The czar then spoke with me, displaying a friendly demeanor, despite his earlier anger. Charlie, speaking of his own experience, found the cell he was in to be comfortable compared to previous accommodations.

"""I'm really tired, Harry,"" Charlie said. ""I lost a lot of blood, but the wound isn't serious. It's hard to stay in the saddle, even though we've been riding slowly. But I'll be fine soon, and I'm relieved to be back.""

""We were all worried about you, Charlie,"" Harry replied. ""We thought you were badly hurt. It was a relief when we heard you weren't. The men were as happy as we were, cheering when they heard the news. Cunningham and Forbes wanted to come with me, but Cunningham had duty, and Forbes thought we'd like to chat.""

Captain Jervoise dismounted and told Charlie, ""You need to see the king right away. He wants to know how you were treated. Make the most of it, lad. There's no need for hard feelings against the Russians.""

Charlie went to the king's quarters, where he was warmly received. The czar was impressed by the treatment of prisoners and commended their courtesy. Charlie was grateful for the kindness shown to him by the Irish doctor and the czar's intervention. He later learned that the czar had punished a general for mistreating him.

Despite his initial recovery, Charlie's wound became inflamed, and he fell ill. After a fortnight, the surgeon advised rest and sent him to Revel for a voyage to Sweden. The king praised Charlie's company and decided to expand it into a regiment due to their discipline and endurance. Major"|"[""1.

It is regrettable, but they have only themselves to hold accountable. They should have waited for an official call from the Swedish government to enlist foreigners, or until gentlemen with noble lineage formed companies and regiments for service. Nonetheless, we are benefiting from this situation as we may not have to wait long. I estimate there are nearly four hundred eager men here ready to serve.

The king had a clever plan to confuse the Saxons. They gathered damp straw to create smoky fires along the riverbank. The smoke would hide the Swedish army's movements. At dusk, the soldiers dismantled the straw stacks and built piles 20 yards apart, dampening them except for one side to start the fire. By daybreak, the smoke veiled the Saxons, who couldn't see the Swedes crossing the river. The Swedish regiments, led by Marshal Steinau, faced the Saxons in battle. Despite the Saxons' artillery advantage, the Swedes, lacking artillery, fought bravely. After a fierce battle, the Swedes triumphed, causing the Saxons to flee. Charles hesitated to pursue the fleeing Saxons into Poland, preferring to use political means to oust Augustus, the Saxon king, from power.|"[""1.

Charlie was relieved to have a friend's house in Warsaw to stay in upon arrival. He discussed the journey with Harry Jervoise, excited about his mission. Harry gave him a letter to trader Allan Ramsay for a warm welcome. They planned for Charlie to dress as a young Scotchman and travel with the royal envoy. A Lithuanian servant, Stanislas, would accompany him, speaking Swedish and Polish. Harry appointed Charlie as a captain, providing money for expenses and bribes if needed. Charlie was instructed to communicate the mission's progress and return orders.

They rode through an unguarded gate into Warsaw, a city of greater importance in the past. The citizens were too busy discussing the arrival of the Swedish envoy to notice the travelers. Richly-dressed nobles on magnificent horses galloped by, ignoring the murmurs of the citizens. Stanislas and Charlie stopped at an inn where the horses were taken care of. Stanislas inquired about Allan Ramsay's shop, a Scottish merchant. The landlord grumbled about foreign traders profiting off the locals. Stanislas defended them, saying trade was necessary.

At present, many may oppose Augustus of Saxony. Civil wars, though causing misery, do not affect the capital. Augustus brought the Swedish King to Warsaw without reason. If Augustus remains, Swedish cannons may threaten the city. Politics now concern us. The king believed Warsaw's opposition to Augustus could sway nobles. Allan Ramsay, short on money, knows the Jews with land mortgages lack power. Public opinion may help. Charlie, a trustworthy Swedish officer, plans to discuss this with his friends. However, caution is needed due to Augustus' strong local support. Charlie stayed with Allan Ramsay, met traders, and found Jewish traders less cooperative. Ben Soloman Muller, a doubtful figure, posed a risk. To protect Ramsay, Charlie moved to a nearby lodging. Ramsay downplayed the danger.|"[""1.

He mentioned being with a group of bandits, unsure of their background or intentions, but they showed no hostility towards him. He requested clothes and a sword, advising against sending money. The letter was written in English to avoid being understood by others. The bandits discussed future plans while Charlie rested. The captain arranged for some men to stay with Charlie overnight.

When he woke up, it was already evening, and the men were by the fire, cooking a piece of goat they had found in the woods. One of the men who spoke Swedish stayed with him and explained that the band's main camp was six miles away. They reached the camp the next morning after many breaks for rest. The village where they were had been deserted for a long time, with trees growing among the ruins. The brigands had taken over an old castle in the village, using the banquet hall as their main gathering place. The leader welcomed Charlie, offering food and rest. The men were preparing for a possible expedition to restock their supplies. The next day, Charlie woke to news that troops were nearby, led by a Jewish man. The brigands were cautious, knowing they had been betrayed by a Jew before. The following morning, Charlie was surprised to see Stanislas, who had just recovered from an illness, standing beside him with a bundle.

Reduced to only twelve men and their captain, they focused on moving forward, avoiding villages, and occasionally visiting isolated houses for flour. As they journeyed, the land became less populated. Finally, their leader pointed to a distant belt of trees, signaling safety for the night. A large fire was lit to combat the cold nights. The next day, they selected a spot near a stream to build a hut. The captain and two men went to the nearest town to buy supplies, returning with flour, spirits, and other necessities. They transported everything to the hut, which was made of logs and moss, with a deer skin and rug hanging outside. The men spent their days piling firewood and eating frozen sheep carcasses.

"While they had been confined to the hut, two of the men had made numerous snares for hares. They then set out into the forest to place these snares where they spotted traces of the hares on the snow. The others split into groups to search for different game.

Placing our hut near a stream helps us find our way back. If you find the stream, follow it back to the hut. If you get lost, sit down, think, eat, and use your pistol to signal for help. They hunted hares successfully but struggled with other game. They built shelters to hunt deer and managed to catch some. Bears and elks were also hunted for food. Fishing in the stream was fruitful.

The captain expressed concern about the wolves becoming more daring, possibly from the nearby Russian forest. He mentioned the scarcity of villages there, keeping animals safe. The forest served as a neutral zone between Russia and Poland. Charlie and Stanislas, armed with axes and pistols, ventured cautiously despite wolf attacks. They followed a track used by peasants and travelers. As the cold intensified, peasants abandoned the forest, fearing the wolves. Once, they witnessed a wolf pack chasing horses.

No, we shall have to wait here all night, and probably for some time tomorrow, for the men are not likely to find us very early, and they will hardly hear our pistols unless some of them happen to come in this direction.

""There will be no fear of our sleeping,"" Stanislas said. ""The cold will be too great for that. We shall have to keep on swinging our hands and feet, and rubbing our noses, to prevent ourselves from getting frostbitten.""

Hour after hour passed. Even in the darkness they could see the wolves lying in the snow below them, occasionally changing their position, keeping close together for warmth, and often snarling or growling angrily, as one or two shifted their position, and tried to squeeze in so as to get into a warm spot.

""Manage to make a fire, Stanislas. First of all, we will crawl out towards the ends of the branches as far as we can get, and break off twigs and small boughs. If we can't get enough, we can cut chips off, and we will pile them all where these three big boughs branch off from the trunk.

Ten individuals armed with axes and swords are expected to confront a pack of wolves. The wolves will likely be intimidated by a large fire and hesitate to engage with such a formidable group. As the tree's branches burned and fell, providing warmth, Charlie and his companion remained cautious due to the falling trunk. They noticed the wolves' presence by glimpses of their eyes reflecting the fire. Ready to defend themselves, they gathered wood to maintain a strong fire. A passing sledge was besieged by wolves, prompting shots to deter the predators. The group fortified their position with a barricade of burning branches, preparing to repel any wolf attacks. Armed and vigilant, they awaited the wolves, ensuring the safety of all members, including a lady and child seeking refuge by the fire.|['1.

The wolves seemed uncertain when they saw thick smoke rising, but then attacked. Four fell to rifle bullets, and as they closed in, pistols fired rapidly. Emptying the pistols, the men used blazing brands, driving the wolves back. A fierce fight ensued. Just as the defenders reloaded, the wolves returned, determined. Despite deadly fire, the wolves persisted. Suddenly, a group of men arrived, armed with pistols and axes, scattering the wolves. The defenders, silent until then, regrouped. A child's cry diverted attention, and the wife fainted. Charlie, relieved, greeted Ladislas and his men. The captain explained their arrival, the confusion, and the intense fight.

Charlie was talking to Ladislas when one of the travelers approached Stanislas. Stanislas revealed that Charlie was an English gentleman who, due to suspicion towards strangers, had been unable to travel through the country and was spending the winter hunting with a group of disbanded soldiers who had come to their aid. The other traveler tended to his wife, applying snow to her forehead and giving her brandy. Count Nicholas Staroski, grateful for their help, invited the soldiers to his estate, offering them land, jobs, or money. The Count extended a warm welcome to Charlie, acknowledging his bravery and offering assistance.

Yesterday, on a journey through the forest, we encountered a pack of wolves. Despite a tense encounter, we managed to fend them off. Later, we sought refuge in a village where unsettling stories about the wolves were shared. The next day, we encountered more wolves on our path. A dangerous situation unfolded as the wolves closed in on us. Just when things seemed dire, a young English captain, Charlie, saved us by setting a tree on fire to scare the wolves away. This brave act was commended by the count and his brother, who were impressed by Charlie's quick thinking. The captain, only eighteen years old, shared his background as a Swedish army officer and his mission to promote peace. As we journeyed towards Stromoff, the count's wife awaited to hear our adventurous tale.|"['1.

The horses, a magnificent duo of creatures, displayed signs of fear as they traveled through the forest, starting nervously and needing constant reins to prevent bolting. Once out of the trees, they settled into a swift trot, covering the seven miles to Stromoff in under half an hour. Upon learning the guest's name, the inn's landlord, his wife, and sons hurried to ensure their comfort. Fires blazed in the guest rooms, while the common room was cleared for their use. A meal was quickly prepared, and after dining, everyone gathered around the fire as Charlie recounted his adventures, including his encounter in Warsaw. The discussion touched on the ongoing conflict between Augustus and Charles, with the Swedish army advancing into Poland. The nobles, like Charlie, expressed little interest in the war, preferring to stay out of the territorial disputes to avoid internal division within Poland.|"['1.

We do not want Russia to expand northwards. The Muscovites have shown they can raise large armies, and the czar is uniting them into a nation that could pose a threat in the future. Charles assures us he has no grudge against Poland, only its king, who formed a coalition against him during peace. We, living far from the capital, stay out of court politics. If Augustus defeats the Swedes, we might face issues later. If Charles wins, a new king will be chosen with his guidance. We harbor no ill feelings towards you as a Swedish officer, but for safety, it's best to keep your identity as an English gentleman secret. The countess retired early, and the others talked late into the night, discussing the country's unrest. Disbanded soldiers and desperate groups are looting, causing clashes with nobles. The count advises Charlie not to travel until spring due to the dangers. The next day, they reach the count's chateau, a plain but large building. The count's family and staff warmly welcome Charlie, grateful for his bravery against wolves. The countess is relieved to find her child safe. A lavish dinner is served, showcasing Polish hospitality. Charlie observes how nobles like the count often overspend on such grand feasts.|"['1.

The count mentioned that Charlie could relax the next day but would be entertained afterward. There were various activities like shooting, sled rides, and a grand event planned to celebrate their return and the child's recovery. Charlie enjoyed the sled rides and was amazed by the elegant dresses and lively dancing at the event. The count wanted Charlie to stay longer, but he was eager to rejoin the army. They embarked on their journey with two sledges, well-equipped for the trip. Charlie was loaded with gifts and new attire. The journey was pleasant, with stays at noble estates.

The army paused for a while to rest after long marches and built a bridge across the Vistula. Negotiations with the Swedes failed, and they entered Warsaw to a warm welcome. In late June, they advanced to face Augustus' larger force. On July 6th, the Swedes neared Clissow. The next day, battle was planned for the anniversary of a previous victory. The Swedes attacked fiercely, with the Duke of Holstein's division leading, but he was fatally wounded. Despite initial resistance, the Polish division was defeated. The battle lasted four hours, resulting in a Swedish victory. The Saxons suffered heavy losses, and Charles' troops advanced, capturing Cracow.

At the end of next week, on a moonlit Friday, a plan is set in motion. Jack Mercer and Jerry Skinlow are to meet for a clandestine meeting. The aim is to intercept a group of highwaymen who plan to attack a coach a few miles outside of town. The highwayman, the captain of the gang, is the target.

Harry and Charlie devised a plan to catch a notorious highwayman. They intended to enlist the help of two sharp boys to watch over taverns where the criminal frequented. The boys would track anyone visiting the taverns and report back. Harry believed the highwayman would return to his lodging, and if the place seemed respectable, they would arrest him there. However, if the lodging was suspicious, they planned to ambush him as he approached. The tipstaff suggested that the highwayman would likely have stolen goods on him. Harry proposed seeking assistance from the Duke of Marlborough to handle the situation officially. The following day, dressed in their best, they visited the Duke, who welcomed them warmly and offered them positions in the service under their national flag.|"[""**1.

Before I began, he mentioned that circumstances have shifted since William's passing. Marlborough now holds a higher position with Anne than he did with William. Although his inclinations have always leaned towards Jacobite, now that he and the Tories are in power while the Whigs are out of favor, Marlborough could greatly benefit us if he chose. Being a Jacobite is no longer a crime, and rumors suggest the Tories plan to overturn the act of succession, making James Stuart the heir to Anne. Even if we had managed to clear our fathers' names through Marlborough's influence, they would not have returned as long as the shadow of being involved in an assassination plot loomed over them. However, now that they are exonerated and can return honorably, it will be a whole new scenario. It will be joyous news for them. As soon as we receive official confirmation that the estates are restored, we will set off. We only need to reclaim them since yours is the only estate granted to another. The rest were put up for sale, but no one bid on them as the title deeds would have been worthless if King James returned. So, they have been leased to farmers, and we can reclaim them without displacing anyone.|"[""1.

After finishing their breakfast, the two friends wrapped themselves in their cloaks and hats and ventured out into the streets. The strong gale surprised them as they saw tiles and chimney pot fragments scattered all around. The force of the wind had blown in upper windows and sent tiles flying like autumn leaves. They struggled to walk, clinging to railings to avoid being swept away by the gusts. They witnessed roofs being stripped of gutters and lead sheets, causing chaos. Despite being powerful young men, they had to be cautious of falling chimneys and debris. The storm intensified, causing massive damage, with ships lost at sea and buildings destroyed. The friends eventually had to return to safety due to the dangerous conditions, realizing the severity of the unprecedented storm.|['1.
