Henry, a young man who enjoyed spending money, found himself accused of stealing a large sum from Snow Lodge. Despite Mr. Carford's belief, Henry denied taking the money. This led to a heated argument, resulting in Henry being driven away from the lodge. Bitter words were exchanged, causing Mr. Carford to close up the place. Nan, who knew the truth, tried to help Henry, but Mr. Carford refused to believe him. The incident strained the relationship between Mr. Carford and Henry. The mystery of the missing money lingered, with no proof of Henry's innocence. The situation left a deep impact on Mr. Carford, who loved Henry dearly.

Bert suggested that their father might use a large sled to take them all to Snow Lodge. They needed to pack plenty of food for the journey as it was quite a distance to the store and they could get snowed in. Nan mentioned that she would prefer to skate there if it wasn't so far, but she was concerned about taking Freddie on the ice-boat due to his young age. Bert proposed inviting some friends to join them at Snow Lodge. Mr. Bobbsey inquired if their homemade boat could reach the upper end of the lake. Bert was confident it could, but he didn't want to go alone. However, his father couldn't accompany him as he needed to ride in the sled with their mother and provisions. Dinah, the family cook, joked about Bert's mischievous antics. The Bobbsey parents decided that Bert and Nan could each invite a friend to join them at Snow Lodge, as the old farmhouse there was well-equipped with everything they needed.|"['1.

"Bert needed a companion to sail the ice-boat, but all the other boys were unavailable. Mr. Bobbsey thought it was too risky for Bert to sail alone due to the small size of the boat, so he suggested that Bert and Nan join them in the big sled instead.

Dorothy Minturn, Nan's cousin from the seashore, mentioned that she had a lot to carry. She joked that it would be easier to roll than walk. Dorothy explained that she left her boat in the cove due to the wind, and they were busy preparing for a trip to Snow Lodge. Harry and Dorothy, who had spent summers with the Bobbseys, arrived soon after receiving an invitation. The Bobbsey family was getting ready for a winter vacation in the woods. They had a sled, provisions, and Snow Lodge was prepared by a farmer. As they sailed on the lake on the _Ice Bird_, the wind grew stronger, causing the boat to tilt. Bert and Harry struggled to steer against the wind, with the sail almost tearing apart. Suddenly, a fierce gust made the ice-boat stop, scaring everyone on board.

Dorothy and Nan enjoyed skating on the frozen lake, a fun change from sitting on the ice-boat. But as the wind picked up, Harry and Bert skated far ahead. Seeing the girls' signal, Bert and Harry lowered the sail, waiting for them. The group continued on the Ice Bird, passing familiar towns along the shore. Nan and Bert recognized these places from summer visits. The group stopped to eat chocolate and sandwiches, preparing for a possible storm.

All bundled up, the youngsters ventured into the woods with Snap happily barking by their side. Surrounding Snow Lodge, the dense woods provided some relief from the deep snow that covered the open fields. As they reached the hilltop, a breathtaking view of the snow-covered lake and woods awaited them. However, the journey downhill was challenging, especially for Flossie and Freddie, prompting a mid-way break under a tree. Suddenly, a snow slide approached, causing panic. Bert swiftly directed everyone to safety behind the tree trunk as the snow mass cascaded towards them. Investigating the cause, Bert and Harry found traces of a large snowball deliberately rolled down the slope, suspecting Danny Rugg's involvement.

The frozen lake was covered in snow, making it impossible for skating or using the ice-boat. Mr. Bobbsey, with Harry and Bert, retrieved the Ice Bird using horses. Meanwhile, Bert, Nan, Flossie, and Freddie were in the kitchen making candy, with Dinah helping. Snap, the dog, got his jaws stuck in the candy, needing warm water to free him. Despite mishaps, they enjoyed roasting apples, making popcorn, and candy. Later, a thaw followed by freezing allowed for ice-boating races. On a warm day, Bert, Nan, Dorothy, and Harry went for a walk but got lost. Snowfall made it harder, but they pressed on.

Dinah quickly cleaned up the mess caused by the fallen tree, making the Bobbseys comfortable again by adding more wood to the fire. The damaged part of the house was closed off. As the sun rose after the storm, they were surprised by the vast amount of snow outside. One of the doors was completely snowed in, requiring Sam to shovel a path. Bert, Harry, Nan, and Dorothy decided to investigate where the tree had fallen. To their amazement, they found a roll of green paper that had been hidden in a crack in the wall for years. It turned out to be the money that Mr. Carford had accused Henry of taking. Mr. Bobbsey and Sam embarked on a challenging journey through the snow to return the money to Mr. Carford, who apologized for his mistake and planned a celebration to make amends.|['1.
