Frisky Squirrel, a bold and nimble little creature, lived with his mother in a cozy hollow limb of a hickory tree. Their home was conveniently located near nuts, their favorite food found during the fall. When the nuts were scarce, they enjoyed seeds and even Farmer Green's corn. The woods surrounding their home were filled with excellent climbing trees that Frisky loved to leap between, fearlessly venturing to the smallest limbs' ends. Mrs. Squirrel marveled at her son's boundless energy, always on the move and rarely still. Frisky's mischievous nature led him to tease the birds, especially Jasper Jay, the biggest blue jay in the area. Despite the fun and games, Frisky wished for longer days to explore more trees and engage in his playful antics.|"[""1.

Frisky Squirrel had a delightful time at his second picnic, savoring all the tasty treats. His favorite was a sweet, white-coated treat that reminded him of snow but tasted much better.

Frisky narrowly avoided a red-tailed hawk swooping past him, mistaking it for Jasper Jay. The hawk circled back, initiating a lively game of dodging for Frisky. Despite the hawk's relentless pursuit, Frisky's agility saved him. The hawk, impressed by Frisky's speed, eventually flew away.

Just in time, Frisky Squirrel narrowly escaped Mr. and Mrs. Hawk's pursuit. With both hawks after him, Frisky found himself in a tricky situation. Feeling helpless, he called for his mother, but she was nowhere to be found. As he tried to reach the safety of his hickory tree home, the hawks blocked his path. Frisky thought his end was near when Mr. Hawk's talons almost caught him. However, a brave olive-green bird named Mr. Kinglet and his courageous wife came to the rescue. Hearing the commotion, Mrs. Kinglet alerted her husband, who fearlessly confronted the hawks. Mr. Kinglet's bravery distracted the hawks, allowing Frisky to escape to the safety of his tree.

Frisky Squirrel was relieved to be back home and quickly disappeared through the door. However, curiosity got the better of him, and he peeked out to find Mr. and Mrs. Hawk gone. The forest creatures were expressing gratitude to Mr. and Mrs. Kinglet for chasing them away, including Frisky Squirrel who felt remorse for teasing Mrs. Kinglet. Uncle Sammy asked Frisky to help him get corn, but he was cautious as Uncle Sammy seemed suspicious. They arrived at Farmer Green's place at dusk, and Uncle Sammy instructed Frisky to climb a tree and drop corn from a hole in the wall.

Frisky had been diligently working for a while. He started to think the bag might be full. Curious, he peeked out of a hole in the wall and saw Uncle Sammy Coon with the bag of corn, rushing away. Despite his limp, Uncle Sammy was moving quickly. Frisky saw a dog bark below the hole, and then Farmer Green approached with a gun. Frisky didn't wait around.

He sprinted to the woods, deciding not to tell his mother about the incident since he couldn't bring any corn home. Uncle Sammy later explained that he dropped the corn due to being chased by a dog.

Long before Frisky Squirrel reached Farmer Green's place, he started to worry that Mr. Crow might have grown impatient waiting for him. Frisky knew the butternuts were in the attic, but he felt uneasy about visiting the farmhouse. As he neared the house, he heard Mr. Crow calling from a nearby tree, which relieved him. Despite his mother's warnings about Mr. Crow, Frisky found him kind. In the attic, Frisky was so engrossed in eating nuts that he forgot to thank Mr. Crow. Suddenly, the door opened, startling Frisky, who hid until the coast was clear. When he tried to leave through the window, he realized it was shut due to an approaching storm.

In Farmer Green's attic, Frisky Squirrel found himself surrounded by nuts but felt unhappy and frightened. After a storm passed, the door was slightly open, but Frisky didn't notice it until he nosed around the room. When he found the crack, he happily squeezed through and hurried downstairs to Farmer Green's kitchen. As he dashed across the floor, a small dog leaped out from behind the stove and chased him.

Frisky Squirrel's heart raced as he saw a small animal, actually Farmer Green's cat, climbing up the tree towards him. Curious, Frisky wondered if the cat could fly as well. Scampering to the top of the tree and onto a branch of another nearby tree, Frisky realized the cat couldn't fly and could only watch him from a distance. One summer day, Frisky witnessed Farmer Green's horses pulling a peculiar wagon into the field. It was larger and had wheels in unusual places. Watching from a tree, he saw another wagon with a walkway leading up a hill to a wooden bar. Men and Johnnie Green were busy around the wagons unloading wheat sheaves.
