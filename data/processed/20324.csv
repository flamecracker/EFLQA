Despite the pleasant meal and songs shared at the table, Joe's somber mood during a patriotic tune hinted at deeper emotions tied to the ongoing war. The girls, having sung for soldiers before, noticed Joe's bitterness. However, their intuition suggested there was more to his story than met the eye. The tension eased as they moved on from the topic, but Joe's unresolved feelings lingered.

The heavy rain had turned into a light drizzle, and Mrs. Ford suggested they head back to Bensington. However, Mrs. Barnes firmly rejected the idea due to the muddy roads.

Mollie cheerfully interrupted the group, announcing it was already twelve o'clock, and they had an early start for their adventure the next day. Betty, excited by the beautiful morning, reassured them that the roads were dry and perfect for their journey. In just fifteen minutes, the hungry girls were gathered in the dining room, ready for the day. Mrs. Ford and Joe were already there. Betty couldn't shake off the admiration she felt for Joe, who couldn't join them due to health reasons. As they prepared to leave, Mrs. Ford expressed her wish for Mrs. Barnes to come along. The cars set off, with Mollie and Betty leading the way. Despite the slightly slippery roads, the girls enjoyed a good speed. Betty, trying to change the topic, remarked on the surprise of Joe being Mrs. Barnes' son, leading Grace to tease her about her driving skills.|"[""1.

They sped through Bensington without stopping until Mollie's horn sounded a warning. Betty dashed back to the car, and they resumed their journey, making good time under the scorching sun. By noon, they arrived at Hill Crest, a small village with no grand hotel but a quaint bakery. The friendly woman there prepared delicious sandwiches, rolls, cake, and fresh milk for them. After their satisfying meal, they visited a general store for supplies. As they left, a narrow escape with a wagon in front led to a heated moment, but they managed to defuse the situation. Determined to continue their journey, Betty suggested following the stubborn wagon to see what the driver was up to, ready to take action if needed.|"['1.

Betty was furious at the cranky farmer blocking the road. She wanted to scare him but decided against it. Her anger surged as she followed the wagon. Betty's ancestors were fighters, and she couldn't stand the indignity. Determined to act, she discussed a plan with her friends. Grace suggested a detour to block the farmer's path. As they executed the plan, Mollie pretended to fix her car, while the farmer approached. Despite their efforts to keep a straight face, the girls struggled not to laugh. The farmer, oblivious, drove into the muddy ditch to bypass them. The girls were surprised but determined not to let him outsmart them.|"[""1.

"""I believe so,"" she said, quickly assessing the situation as the stern old man was already pushing through the ditch to pass them. Without hesitation, she leaped into the driver's seat and ignited the engine. ""Let's go,"" she exclaimed cheerfully. ""Hop in, girls."" The girls eagerly jumped into the car, with Betty and Grace rushing to the leading car. As the man urged his horses forward and shouted at them in a less than friendly manner, both cars accelerated and sped down the road.

""It's amazing how children adore nature,"" reflected Betty, reminiscing about Dodo and Paul wanting to join them. ""I almost wish we could have brought the twins. They would have enjoyed it so much.""

""We would have been too busy keeping them out of trouble,"" remarked Grace dryly. ""Besides, Mrs. Billette wouldn't have allowed it. She's always worried about them.""

""Yes,"" Grace agreed, now serious. ""Turn into the driveway that leads to the garage at the rear. And, Betty, the house sits on a small cliff overlooking the ocean. Can you hear it? I mean the ocean, not the house, silly!""

As Betty parked the car behind the charming cottage, the enchanting sound of the ocean, with its rhythmic waves against the rocks, filled the air, prompting her to chuckle with delight.

After dinner, they strolled onto the spacious veranda, almost as large as the entire house. The night was enchanting, with the moon casting a magical silver glow over everything, accompanied by the gentle sounds of lapping water. Betty suggested that if their guests didn't arrive that day, either she or Mollie would go to the station to check on them. The group planned to head down to the station since they had sent their guests by train and had driven by car themselves. Excited about the beach, Mollie and Betty decided to prepare for the outing. Grace stood out with a stylish but impractical cap, prompting playful banter from the others. As they headed towards the beach, Mrs. Ford joined them, and they watched Betty and Mollie dive into the water, showing off their swimming skills. Grace reassured them about their safety, and Mrs. Ford kindly offered to prepare a meal for them, earning hugs and gratitude from the girls.|['1.

"""It feels so peaceful and wonderful here,"" Amy remarked, gazing around. ""It's like we're in a different world, far away from everything else. It almost makes me think the war is just a dream--"" 

Mollie's expression turned grave as she read a telegram, her face paling. ""No, it's not a dream,"" she interrupted, handing it to Betty. 

Agreeing, Mollie sat down, her eyes searching for a handkerchief. ""They always came home before night. It must be serious if they're not back,"" she said worriedly. 

Betty comforted Mollie, ""Don't worry about the party. We care about you more."" 

As they prepared lunch, Betty suggested, ""Your mother would have heard if it was an accident. They might be lost. Let's stay positive and think of a plan.""

Betty expressed confidence that with everyone in Deepdale searching for them, the girls were unlikely to starve. She speculated that the missing children might already be safe at home. Betty then pondered sending a telegram to her mother. Mrs. Ford advised waiting a day or two in case the children were found, to avoid a trip for nothing. Mollie agreed to wait and then swiftly changed into street clothes to rush to the station with her friends. They drove recklessly, reaching the station quickly. Inside, they encountered an odd man with red-rimmed eyes. Mollie sent the telegram while the girls watched him.
