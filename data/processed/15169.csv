Two young siblings, Freddie and Flossie, were out ice skating on a frozen lake with their older siblings, Bert and Nan. Flossie's skate had come loose, and she thought of using paste to fix it. Freddie, resourceful and skilled from playing outdoors, came to her aid. He secured the skate with pieces of wood, and they caught up to Bert and Nan. The group decided to get hot chocolate together at a nearby stand. Bert joked about Freddie being a firefighter searching for ice cracks. The siblings skated off happily, leaving behind the frozen lake as they headed towards the treat stand.|"['Question 1:\nWhat problem did Flossie encounter while ice skating?\nA) Her skate broke\nB) Her skate came loose\nC) She fell down\nD) She lost her balance\nE) She got cold', ""Question 2:\nHow did Freddie fix Flossie's skate?\nA) With tape\nB) With paste\nC) With glue\nD) With string\nE) With a band-aid"", ""Question 3:\nWhat did the group decide to do after fixing Flossie's skate?\nA) Go home\nB) Continue skating\nC) Get hot chocolate\nD) Play a game\nE) Build a snowman"", 'Question 4:\nWhat did Bert joke about Freddie being?\nA) A chef\nB) A teacher\nC) A scientist\nD) A firefighter\nE) A police officer', 'Question 5:\nHow did the siblings feel as they skated off towards the treat stand?\nA) Sad\nB) Angry\nC) Worried\nD) Happy\nE) Frustrated', 'Question 6:\nWhat did the siblings leave behind as they headed towards the treat stand?\nA) Their skates\nB) Their jackets\nC) The frozen lake\nD) Their gloves\nE) Their hats']"|['B) Her skate came loose', 'B) With paste', 'C) Get hot chocolate', 'D) A firefighter', 'D) Happy', 'C) The frozen lake']
In the cozy cabin built over the stand for skaters in Winter, Bert planned to treat his siblings and Tommy Todd to hot chocolate. As they set off skating, Bert jokingly promised to carry anyone whose skate came off. Skating merrily on the frozen lake, Flossie and Freddie tumbled down when Freddie tripped over some wood. The children raced on, leaving white streaks on the ice. Bert noticed an ice-boat heading towards Flossie and Freddie, who were focused on winning the race. Urged by Nan, Bert skated swiftly to warn them before they collided with the boat.|"['1.

At that moment, Bert's loud cries or perhaps just fatigue made the two kids leading the skating race pause and glance back. They noticed Bert gesturing towards them and then saw the ice-boat approaching closely, causing Flossie to scream. The boat's steersman also spotted the children and swerved to avoid them, narrowly missing Tommy Todd. Tommy, a skilled skater, halted just in time to dodge the boat. The boat passed by with a swift whoosh, scraping ice chips as it went, startling all five children. The Bobbsey family comprised two sets of twins: Nan and Bert, the older pair with dark features, and Flossie and Freddie, the younger, chubby duo with light hair and blue eyes. Additionally, the family included their parents, the amiable cook Dinah Johnson and her husband Sam, as well as their beloved pets Snoop the cat and Snap the dog.|"[""1.

"Bert called out, ""Wait a minute! Don't get into more danger."" The ice-boat approached slowly, and Mr. Watson apologized for nearly running into them before. He offered them a ride on the ice-boat, and the Bobbsey twins, familiar with boats from their father's dock, eagerly accepted. Mr. Watson ensured they were wrapped up warmly and set sail, speeding down the frozen lake. Flossie and Freddie clung on, enjoying the thrilling ride. The twins disembarked near their father's lumber dock, thanking Mr. Watson with glowing cheeks. That night, Mr. Bobbsey playfully teased the twins about their adventure. The next day, Nan discovered Bert and Tommy building an ice-boat named the _Bird_. Excited about the upcoming sail, Bert and Tommy shared their plans with Nan. A week later, the Bobbsey family, including Snap the dog, enjoyed a day by the docks, where Bert and Tommy were preparing for their ice-boat adventure."|"['1.

Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey boarded the ice-boat Bert and Tommy had built. The boat had been tested and deemed safe by Mr. Watson. With the entire Bobbsey family on board, the ice-boat glided over the lake. Snap, the dog, tried to keep up but soon turned back. As the wind picked up, Bert assured everyone of their safety with the abundance of blankets on board. The steel runners of the boat clinked on the ice, creating a shower of icy splinters. Despite the desire for a race, Bert knew his mother wouldn't approve. Flossie followed instructions to feel better, while Bert skillfully steered the boat, adjusting the sail to catch the wind. Freddie was eager to help but was told to wait for calmer winds.|"[""1.

The ice-boat suddenly spun to the side, almost tipping over, causing screams from Mrs. Bobbsey and Nan. Bert, losing control, flew out of the boat followed by his parents and sister. Meanwhile, Flossie and Freddie remained safe aboard, carried away by the wind. Initially unaware of the chaos, Flossie soon realized they were alone on the boat. The rope caught on the rudder, keeping the boat steady down the lake. Freddie, determined to steer, struggled with the tiller as Flossie watched. Unable to hear the others, the young twins sailed on, with Freddie attempting to navigate the boat by loosening the rope tied to the rudder.|['1.

Freddie said he would go back for them. He grabbed the rope from the tiller, and suddenly, the ice-boat sped up. He tried to steer but the boat tipped, nearly tossing out Flossie and Freddie. The wind carried them far down the lake, out of sight of their family. Approaching the lake's end, they saw snowdrifts near the forest. Freddie tugged another rope and turned the tiller sharply, causing the boat to veer towards the shore. It glided over the ice, tilting to bury the bow in a snowdrift, sending the twins and blankets flying into soft snow. Unhurt, they heard a voice and saw Uncle Jack, a woodchopper, approaching with an axe. He offered warmth in his cabin, recognizing the Bobbsey twins and leading them to safety.|['1.

Flossie and Freddie sat by a warm stove, enjoying a simple meal of bread and milk provided by the kind woodchopper. Despite the humble fare, the hungry siblings found it delicious, even better than chicken and ice cream, as Freddie remarked. The woodchopper shared his solitary life story, having spent years chopping wood in the forest after being unable to work the land. He lived alone in a cabin he built himself, reminiscing about a lost family. The Bobbsey family searched for the missing children, eventually reuniting after a series of adventures on the icy lake.

"""Yes! He went into a store with many bugs in the window!"" exclaimed Flossie once more. ""They're huge bugs that walk around and around!"" She vigorously shook her blonde head in excitement. Leading her father by the hand, Flossie guided him back to where she had come from, up a set of wide stone steps towards the main station entrance. As they neared the vestibule, Flossie pointed out the arcade. Mr. Bobbsey recognized it as part of the depot, a spacious entrance with stores on either side selling various items.

The train stopped, and a kind woman guided Flossie and Freddie to the elevated station. They watched people buying tickets and getting off trains. The agent, busy with the rush, didn't notice them. Feeling unnoticed, the twins left the station and heard a hand piano's music. Freddie bought peanuts, and they joined a crowd watching a monkey. The monkey mistook Flossie's hat cherries for real ones and tried to grab them. Mistaking them for real, he ran away when he realized they were fake. Freddie saw Flossie's torn hat and got an idea.

Flossie and Freddie found themselves in a big store, lost after a monkey incident on an express train. Freddie boldly approached a tall man, asking for a new hat for Flossie. The man, Mr. Whipple, the store owner, kindly listened to their story. He arranged for Flossie to get a new hat and promised to help find their family. As closing time approached, Mr. Whipple considered taking care of the children at his home if their father didn't arrive. Soon, to the children's relief, their father, Mr. Bobbsey, was located and reunited with them at the store.

"""Ah, yes, I presume so,"" said Mr. Bobbsey. ""Thank you very much, Mr. Whipple, for looking after the children for me. I reached the One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street elevated station a little while ago, and the ticket agent there was very much excited because the children had slipped out while he was in his office.

A little later they were safe in the hotel where the Bobbsey family was to live while in New York. Mrs. Bobbsey, Bert and Nan were already there, and quite glad to see the two runaways, you may be sure.

It had been indeed, a full day since the Bobbsey twins had left their home in Lakeport that morning, and Mrs. Bobbsey insisted on Flossie and Freddie, at least, going to bed early. This the small twins were glad enough to do, after they had told Nan and Bert the different things that had happened after they got on the express train.""

Bert thought the twins would be scared about being lost, but they were calm. Nan explained they had wandered so far in the subway station that they couldn't find where their dad asked them to wait. Bert reassured them, saying their dad would find them. A subway guard approached, sent by their father to bring them back. The guard led them through platforms and stairs. The twins were far from where their dad left them. Flossie felt thirsty and they left the station for a candy store. Mr. Bobbsey planned to visit the Aquarium. Later, they saw alligators and a crocodile. They moved to the sea lion pool. The sea lion swam gracefully and barked like a dog. The smaller children could step up on a pipe to see better.|"['1.

Mr. Bobbsey guided the children to the tank's south end, where a green moray eel rested in a sewer pipe. He pointed out the large turtles swimming gracefully in the clear water. The turtles moved with ease, their flippers propelling them around the tank. One massive turtle swam alone, while a stuffed leather-back turtle hung overhead. Freddie, excited, wished for a ride on the turtles. Suddenly, he leaped over the rail, landing on the back of the large swimming turtle. His family gasped in shock, but the turtle remained calm, swimming with Freddie on its broad shell. Mr. Bobbsey hurried to help, ensuring Freddie's safety. Despite the scare, the turtle did not harm Freddie, who clung to its shell, enjoying an unexpected ride.|"[""1.

"""Stop!"" Mr. Bobbsey exclaimed, feeling relieved as he saw the Aquarium employee coming to rescue Freddie from the turtle ride. ""One ride is enough for the family. Hang on tight, Freddie!"" he shouted as the turtle approached where they stood. The man swiftly lifted Freddie off the turtle's back as it swam close to the wooden platform.

""Thank you,"" Mr. Bobbsey expressed his gratitude. Freddie was now safe, the turtle sinking to the pool's bottom without him. The Aquarium man warned against the danger of falling into a pool with multiple turtles. Freddie was dried off and given new shoes and stockings. Mrs. Bobbsey was initially worried but then chuckled at the adventure.

Afterward, they enjoyed a ferry ride to Staten Island and a visit to the engine room. Excited for a theatre matinée, the Bobbsey twins got dressed up in new outfits.

Freddie shared with his friends how they used to have fun pretending with everyday objects like dirt and stones, but they hadn't done that since they arrived in New York. However, he did recall a funny incident at the aquarium where he rode on a turtle's back. The show they watched was hilarious, and Freddie laughed so much he almost fell off his seat. After the play, parents chatted and made friends, leading to Mrs. Bobbsey and Laddie's aunt, Mrs. Whipple, becoming friends too. Laddie invited Freddie and Flossie to play at his place, where they had a great time with toys and even set up a make-believe store. As they played with fire engines and dolls, they noticed a commotion outside with fire engines on the street.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Freddie and his friends used to do with everyday objects like dirt and stones?\nA) Play soccer\nB) Pretend with them\nC) Eat them\nD) Paint them\nE) Collect them', ""Question 2:\nWhere did Freddie recall riding on a turtle's back?\nA) At the zoo\nB) At the aquarium\nC) In the park\nD) At the beach\nE) At the museum"", 'Question 3:\nWhat almost happened to Freddie while watching the show at the aquarium?\nA) He almost cried\nB) He almost fell asleep\nC) He almost fell off his seat\nD) He almost left\nE) He almost got lost', 'Question 4:\nHow did Mrs. Bobbsey and Mrs. Whipple become friends?\nA) Through work\nB) At the theater\nC) At the store\nD) Through their children\nE) At the restaurant', 'Question 5:\nWhere did Laddie invite Freddie and Flossie to play?\nA) At the beach\nB) At the park\nC) At his place\nD) At the museum\nE) At the zoo', ""Question 6:\nWhat did Freddie, Flossie, and Laddie play with at Laddie's place?\nA) Bicycles and skateboards\nB) Fire engines and dolls\nC) Video games\nD) Board games\nE) Kites and frisbees""]"|['B) Pretend with them', 'B) At the aquarium', 'C) He almost fell off his seat', 'D) Through their children', 'C) At his place', 'B) Fire engines and dolls']
"""Sure,"" said Laddie. ""We'll go, all right. My aunt's looking out the front window, and we can go out the side door and down the elevator,"" he went on. ""I know all the elevator men, 'cause I've lived in this hotel a whole year. My aunt won't care 'cause she won't see us, so she won't be worried. I don't like her to worry.""

""Me either,"" said Freddie. So the two little boys, making sure Mrs. Whipple was still looking from the front windows of her apartment, to see what all the excitement was about, stole out of a door into the side hall and so reached the elevators. The fire was not near enough to the hotel to cause any danger, though many of the hotel guests were excited, and so no attention was paid to the small boys, Freddie and Laddie, as they hurried out to see all that was going on. There was a crowd in the side street and more engines and hook and ladder trucks were dashing up to help put out the fire.

""All right; I'll wait for you here,"" Freddie said. They had been standing not far away from the side entrance to the hotel, and as Laddie turned to go back after his aunt, Freddie walked down the street a little way, nearer the fire.

Mr. Whipple had a unique idea to showcase camping gear in his store by setting up a camp with real campers. These campers lived as if they were truly camping, cooking over a fire and even shooting at targets. The Bobbsey family visited the store camp and enjoyed the experience. They shared a story about Uncle Jack, a kind woodchopper who lives like he's camping out. When Mr. Bobbsey learned that Uncle Jack needed medical help, he decided to cover the expenses to ensure he received proper care.

Mr. Whipple expressed his love for camping and eagerness to assist Uncle Jack, a woodsman friend. Mr. Bobbsey welcomed his help, indicating they would jointly care for Uncle Jack. The children, though not fully comprehending, were aware of the plan to aid their old friend. Mr. Whipple offered to share the expenses, which Mr. Bobbsey accepted. They decided to inform the office to look after the woodchopper. Later, the Bobbsey family visited a large store, where each child selected a gift. Nan chose a ribbon, Bert a desired book, Flossie silk for her doll's dress, and Freddie a toy hose cart. Laddie received a cork-shooting gun as his present.

The captain hailed a taxi and sent the Bobbsey twins and their friend to the hotel with an undercover policeman to avoid attracting a crowd. Upon returning, Mrs. Bobbsey was surprised by the event. Later, Mrs. Bobbsey planned to visit an old childhood friend, Mrs. Robinson, in a less affluent part of New York. Mrs. Robinson invited them to see her apartment and watch the children play in the streets. Mrs. Bobbsey decided to take Flossie and Freddie along while Bert and Nan went to the movies. In Mrs. Robinson's neighborhood, the children met a boy offering rides in a goat-drawn wagon for a small fee. Excited, Flossie and Freddie paid for a ride and set off down the block, unaware of their mother's conversation inside.

"No, he was delirious with fever the entire time. Before my arrival, he had informed some doctors that he had vital information for me, related to his friends or family, they said. He refused to speak to anyone else but me, but when I reached his bedside, he was unable to communicate clearly. So, I remain as clueless about him as before. I'm unaware of his true identity. Sometimes he referred to himself as Jackson, other times by different names. It's possible he was unsure of his own identity. It may be a while before he can provide any clarity. He was still incoherent when I left.

""Not until they summon me, which will be when his condition improves or worsens. I want to assist the elderly man as much as possible, as he was kind to Flossie and Freddie. But now, please update me on the goat.""

Freddie and Flossie took turns narrating, creating a comical tale. Mr. Bobbsey chuckled heartily. He then wanted to hear about all the events during his absence in Lakeport.

""Well, there has been a thaw, and Lake Metoka doesn't have enough ice for sailing the _Bird_. I assume Tommy will have to wait until your return, Bert. We can expect more cold weather.""
