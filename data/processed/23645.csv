Billie tries to reassure her cousin that camping can be restful once you get used to it. She describes the camp as a beautiful log house with an open ceiling and wire netting to keep out mosquitoes.

"Two weeks after graduation, the Motor Maids were feeling the strain of their hard work during the winter.

After finals, they all felt exhausted. Mr. Campbell found ""Sunrise Camp"" in the Adirondacks for the group to stay. They arrived at the rustic camp, but not everyone shared Billie's enthusiasm. The camp was surrounded by pine trees and had a view of the valley. Despite the beautiful scenery, the Motor Maids were tired and doubtful about their remote and basic accommodations.

Only Mary was aware of the rain and the soft wind that carried the fragrance of the wet woods just before dawn. Mary witnessed the magical sunrise with its hues of pink, rosy blush, orange, and gold, culminating in the sun's appearance. She closed the bamboo blinds to keep out the sunlight, allowing everyone to sleep to the melody of forest birds. At six o'clock, a melodious trumpet call woke them up, signaling a new day.

Miss Campbell felt relieved when her cousin invited Ben to visit. While Mr. Lupo was helpful with trails and roads, she didn't fully trust him due to his prejudices. Billie suggested a walking trip to a peak with a stunning view. Mrs. Lupo's peculiar ways, like not using the blackberries, irked the girls. Billie found Mrs. Lupo aggravating when she didn't follow instructions. Nancy, in her pretty outfit, worried about Mr. Lupo's judgment. The girls set off on their walk, each with their unique style. Nancy, in her snug skirt, worried about its narrowness. Despite Mrs. Moxley's insistence, she managed to get a bit more fabric added.

The group of six friends embarked on a hike through the pine forest, following a narrow trail that only Ben could see clearly due to his outdoor experience.

Ben mentioned that Nancy knew a shortcut through the swamp and had agreed to guide him back to camp that night to ease Miss Campbell's worries.

After a peaceful nap, Miss Campbell suddenly opened her eyes to find Mrs. Lupo staring at her with a menacing expression. Mrs. Lupo's demeanor had changed, her eyes narrowed and her teeth bared. With remarkable courage, Miss Campbell demanded to know what Mrs. Lupo was hiding. As she stood her ground, Miss Campbell observed the woman cower like a scolded animal.

Miss Campbell slowly regained consciousness to the sound of loud knocks downstairs, but it felt distant to her. A man entered, dressed for a walking trip in knickerbockers, a gray flannel shirt, and a pith helmet. With a cane and telescope, he exuded dignity and confidence. He quickly assessed the surroundings and tended to Miss Campbell, wetting her lips and dabbing her temples. As she awoke, he offered her water mixed with aromatic spirits of ammonia.

Night had fallen, yet the wanderers were still missing. The doctor, observing the shadows climb the mountains, lit a cigar. Silence enveloped the camp as the birds' chirping ceased.

"The doctor was alarmed, ""Did you really send them through that dangerous bog? It's full of traps. You've caused enough trouble today. Where is your husband? Hurry, wake the villagers, get lanterns, go find them!"" ""I'll go,"" she replied and vanished. Mrs. Lupo searched Table Top all night, knowing the trail well but found nothing by dawn. As light spread, she spotted something on the edge of treacherous quicksand - Nancy's skirt. While the men whispered, the girl looked around in awe. Was this a palace?

Phoebe spent her life in a small mountain cabin, isolated from the world. Her father, with a forgotten past, taught her to read from a collection of books. Despite his mysterious background, he instilled refinement in Phoebe. They peddled baskets and wood carvings for a living. Phoebe, filled with knowledge beyond her years, found solace in astronomy, history, poetry, and religious texts. She cherished the constellations, England's history, and the verses she could repeat by heart. Phoebe's deep understanding of life's teachings remained a hidden treasure.

"Dear Papa,

Cousin Helen is all better now, not scared of the Lupos anymore. Dr. Hume is visiting and Cousin Helen won't let him leave. We're all becoming fond of him.

Phoebe, the mountain girl, is mysterious but helpful. Her father, 'Frenchy,' does wood carving. We want to help Phoebe, but she's hard to approach. We're learning new recipes and planning a surprise.

A message was relayed from the train station to the hotel and then to the post office in the village at the base of Sunrise Mountain. Eventually, it reached Billie Campbell. The note read: Nancy, daring in her cooking, mixed all the vegetables in one pot on the kerosene stove, amusing even the Gypsy cooks. Percy, the late riser, would wake to play his trumpet as a morning ritual. The group had breakfast outdoors under the trees, and if it got dark, they would move inside to avoid bugs. Dr. Hume, tired and hungry, joined them, followed by Miss Helen Campbell and others. They had a meal with bread, salad, and ginger ale, struggling to cook a dish called mock duck. Despite the delay, they enjoyed each other's company and the outdoor setting.|"['1.

After a brief silence, broken only by the tinkle of spoons against saucers, the campers around the table glanced at each other guiltily. Except for the portions reserved for the two cooks, there was not a crumb of piddling left.

""Better hide the plates and cover the dish,"" said the doctor in a conspirator's whisper. ""It's enough to provoke them into a mutiny. Time enough to break the news after they have eaten their mock turtle.""

After Billie's companions had left with their equipment, she settled into a comfortable chair amidst the trees, lost in contemplation. The majestic mountains, veiled in a serene blue shadow, stirred her thoughts. How could negative emotions like treachery and jealousy coexist in such a breathtaking setting? Billie found solace in the beauty around her, yet she was too young to grasp that true inspiration requires more than just scenic views. Feeling awake and restless, she pondered taking a forbidden walk, restricted by her father's rules for female members. Eventually, she decided to explore a familiar trail, enveloped by the forest's tranquility and adorned with dried pine needles and ferns. As she strolled, her mind wandered to the ongoing wildfires on the distant mountain, the resilience of Phoebe and her family, and the allure of simplicity amidst adversity.

At the end of the path, Billie spotted an elderly woman slowly walking towards her, leaning on a sturdy stick. She resembled a living ancient tree. Weathered and brown, the woman carried a bulging apron filled with herbs. Billie offered her tea, thinking the woman might not eat regular food. They returned to camp, and Billie brewed coffee for her companion. As the camp woke up, Billie learned about Phoebe's father. She promised the woman more coffee and money if she helped find him. Feeling homesick and weary, Billie realized the complexity of their situation. Despite their good intentions, they had faced hostility.

Billie expressed her gratitude to Phoebe and reminded her of Dr. Hume's instructions not to leave the camp.

Billie reassured her that borrowing clothes was not a favor, and Phoebe was encouraged to wear a pink dress that made her feel like a different person.

Alberdina's dinner had a German flavor, freeing Billie and Nancy from cooking. After eating, the wind picked up, cooling the night. Ben suggested a campfire for storytelling.

Mr. Campbell chuckled at the serious chat between his daughter and the skilled surgeon. He felt proud that his little girl seemed like a doctor in the making. The surgeon explained that the patient, lost in memories from twenty years ago, could be at risk if he recognized familiar faces. They discussed the man's past status and the need for caution in his recovery. The doctor teased Mr. Campbell about his daughter's interest in a young man named Richard. The doctor, focused on the patient's care, hoped for a successful recovery. As they stood outside the cabin, the group conversed quietly. Dr. Hume led Alberdina inside, where she noticed the elegant candlesticks on the mantel, adding a touch of grace to the room. Phoebe knelt outside her father's door, waiting anxiously.|"[""1.

"""Listen carefully, Alberdina,"" the doctor warned. ""Only speak if the man inside asks you a question in German. Answer in three words, then quietly exit. If he calls, you may return."" Alberdina, now serious, followed the doctor into the sick room. Outside, the group waited silently. After a pause, the man on the bed spoke softly in German. Mr. Campbell, understanding the language, listened closely. Alberdina explained she was a laundress at Sunrise Camp, not a palace maid. The man instructed her to send a telegram to Baron von Metz in Dresden, signing it A. J. Mr. Campbell overheard a second telegram to a ""Miss Phoebe Jones"" in England, reassuring her about his illness. The group later discussed the mysterious ""Prince in Exile,"" leaving Alberdina and Phoebe behind at the camp."|"['1.

"They all chatted happily until a car horn interrupted them. A car had stopped nearby, and someone rushed over to the group. ""She was an English governess in the palace,"" one person said. ""She fell in love with the tutor, and they came to America. Sadly, she passed away, leaving behind a baby named Phoebe."" The story continued with twists and turns, involving a nobleman, a missing couple, and a devoted spinster. As autumn approached, the campers needed to return to the valleys for work. The carefree days by the campfire would soon be replaced by responsibilities and tasks.

Near the unmarried woman sits a tall gentleman with a fragile, anxious expression. He sits with arms crossed, gazing at the mountains in the distance across the valley. Instead of pondering the future of his upcoming little home in Surrey, his thoughts dwell on the twenty difficult years he has left behind, akin to the solitary confinement of a prisoner. At times, he glances curiously at his daughter among the group of young people. The man reflects on a revelation shared by Mrs. Lupo about a change in perspective triggered by a young lady's skirt, leading to forgiveness and a fresh start. Percy then captivates the audience with news of hidden wealth and a family history of titles and castles. The story bids farewell to the youth, content and carefree under the harvest moon, before they return to their valley duties.|"[""1.
