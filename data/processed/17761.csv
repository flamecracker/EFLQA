Daddy Bunker was reading the paper on the porch when Mun Bun, also known as Munroe Ford Bunker, called him to the pier. Mun Bun was crab fishing with a piece of meat tied to a string. As he reeled it in, he saw a big crab with a claw moving like a wink. Startled, Mun Bun fell into the river but was quickly rescued by his father. They tried to catch the crab with a net but it escaped. Despite getting wet often during their stay at Cousin Tom's bungalow, the Bunker children, Vi and Laddie, always found ways to have fun. Vi asked questions while Laddie enjoyed making riddles, helping others tell them apart. Mrs. Bunker, watching from the shore, suggested they head back inside as Mun Bun nearly fell in again.|"['1.

Mun Bun reached up on his toes to grab a cake but dropped the glass bowl. Grandpa Ford, Daddy Bunker, and Tom cleaned up the mess. The children were hungry, so they all ate cakes and drank hot milk.

"Outside the Great Hedge, the wind howled and snow swirled in white flakes. Inside, it was warm and cozy. A strange noise startled the grown-ups, but it came from inside. Rose and Russ thought about it. ""Do any of you want a snack?"" asked Grandma Ford, giving Mun Bun bread and jam. The children chatted about their visits while having a late supper due to the storm. They shared rooms, and Mr. and Mrs. Bunker were nearby to help. The kids settled in bed, with some taking longer to sleep. Russ was awoken by a loud noise in the middle of the night.

Grandma Ford suggested playing in the large attic while waiting. The attic was filled with old-fashioned items like trunks with clothes for dress-up, a spinning wheel, candle-moulds, and sleigh bells. The children were excited and ran up to the attic to explore. They found it spacious with a view of the snow-covered fields outside. While playing with the spinning wheels, Margy suddenly disappeared into a dark hole in the attic, causing her siblings to worry. Her cries could be heard, but she couldn't be seen.

Russ and Laddie were exploring the attic, pretending that the spinning wheels were an airship. Meanwhile, Mun Bun wandered off to play with the strings of sleigh bells. As Russ and Laddie got engrossed in their game, they suddenly noticed Mun Bun standing near a spinning wheel, his hair caught in it, looking like someone was pulling it.

Russ, Laddie, and Mun Bun were busy building a giant snowman, leaving the girls to enjoy the coasting hill. Vi and Margy took two sleds, but Margy found it a bit challenging due to her size.

Listen to this story about Laddie and Russ, the two adventurous brothers who decided to make their own snowshoes using barrel staves, ropes, and poles. When the snow fell thick and fast, they fashioned the snowshoes by attaching the barrel staves to their shoes. At first, their feet looked funny, but they were determined to walk on their homemade snowshoes. As they practiced, they got better at walking with them, even though sometimes the fastenings came loose. Despite the challenges, they had lots of fun, and even made a pair for their sisters. The six little Bunkers eagerly waited for the weather to clear up so they could go out and skate on the ice. Grandma Ford reminded them to eat a hearty breakfast before heading out to skate. Daddy Bunker made sure everyone was bundled up warmly for their skating adventure.|['1.

As Daddy Bunker had mentioned, skates were available for Russ, Rose, Laddie, and Vi, brought from home. Russ and Rose had learned to skate the previous winter, and Laddie had tried it a couple of times. Feeling more confident now, Laddie was eager to improve. Vi, not one to be left out, was also keen to learn. Though the children couldn't skate far or fast, they could still have fun, which is the main purpose of skates. The six little Bunkers were warmly dressed as they made their way to the pond behind Grandpa Ford's barn. The frozen pond, once a place for ducks and geese in summer, now resembled a smooth sheet of glass. As Russ and Laddie raced towards the middle, a loud crack startled them. Russ, unable to stop, fell through the ice. In a panic, Laddie avoided the hole, and Mr. Bunker rushed to rescue Russ. Despite the cold water, everyone was safe in the end.|"['1.

Daddy Bunker rushed in, wet and worried, carrying Russ, also soaked. Grandma Ford and Mother Bunker, accustomed to mishaps, quickly changed the shivering children into dry clothes. They sat by the fire, sipping hot milk, until they warmed up. The hole in the ice froze, making it safe for everyone to play. Later, Dick, the hired man, proposed taking some of the little Bunkers for a ride in his ice boat. Grandpa Ford approved, explaining that an ice boat resembles a large skate with runners. The frame consists of two sturdy pieces of wood, with runners attached to slide over the ice. A sail is fixed to a mast for speed, and a tiller steers the boat. The children were thrilled at the idea of gliding over the frozen pond in the ice boat.|"['1.

Russ and Mun Bun sat on old carpet pieces inside Dick's boat cabin, open on all sides like a shallow box. They sailed swiftly over the ice, thrilling Mun Bun and Russ. Laddie and Violet were eager for a turn. Rose and Margy hesitated but eventually joined. The boat tilted, almost spilling them out. Dick decided not to give more rides due to strong winds. After a meal, they skated and played with sleds. Later, a drum noise puzzled the adults until they found the children in bed. The noise came from an alarm clock hidden in the attic drum.

Grandpa Ford suggested that the six little Bunkers should stay at Mr. Thompson's cabin until he fixed the sled. The children followed Grandpa on the well-packed snow highway to the cabin. Mrs. Thompson warmly welcomed them inside, offering bread, milk, and freshly baked cookies. Meanwhile, Mr. Thompson took care of Prince in the stable. The children were curious about a strange noise, which turned out to be Mr. Thompson playing an old horn. Mrs. Thompson explained that he occasionally played the horn in the attic to entertain the children. The kids were relieved to know it wasn't a ghost, like the ones rumored to be at Great Hedge.|"[""**1.

"""I'm sorry my playing sounded so bad,"" chuckled Mr. Thompson as he entered the room with a large brass horn. He blew into it, making a deep ""umph-umph!"" sound that startled the children. ""We're trying to figure out what's causing all the funny noises,"" explained Rose. They shared stories of the odd sounds, each turning out to be something ordinary. Mr. Thompson admitted he enjoyed playing the horn from his band days. The children spotted Grandpa Ford riding Major and told him about the mysterious noise.

Despite their desire to sleep, the older children took a while to doze off. Suddenly, in the dead of night, a horn blared throughout the house. Among the gifts were toys, dolls, sleds, games, and picture books. Russ received a coveted magic lantern, while Laddie got a toy airship he had long wished for. The adults were not overlooked, with gifts like fur-lined slippers, a gold pin, and a new shaving set. Laddie excitedly shared a riddle about fishing with Mother's dress, sparking curiosity. As dinner approached, appetites grew, and the clatter of cutlery filled the air. Grandpa Ford and Daddy Bunker set out to investigate the mysterious noise, prompting the children to join in the search through the house, eventually leading them to the kitchen.|['1.

"""I don't know exactly what makes it,"" said Grandma Ford; ""but the noise comes out of this rain-water pipe under the window of the storeroom. We'll call Daddy Bunker and Grandpa Ford and have them look. But come in and listen, all of you."" With their mother, the six little Bunkers went into the storeroom. Just as they entered, the groan sounded loudly, and, as Grandma Ford said, it came from a rain-water pipe that ran slantingly under the window. When Daddy Bunker and Grandpa Ford came down out of the attic, where they had not been able to find the ""ghost,"" though they heard the sound of it faintly there, they were told what the six little Bunkers had discovered with the help of Grandma Ford. ""Well, the pipe is broken, and partly filled with water from the rain or melted snow. There are also some dried leaves in the pipe. One end has sunk down and the wind blows across that and makes a hollow, groaning sound, just as you can make by blowing across the open mouth of a big, empty bottle. That was the ghost--the wind blowing across the broken water pipe."" ""The noise sounded, sometimes, when the wind didn't blow,"" said Grandpa Ford, as he took the pipe apart, ""because of the dried leaves that were in it. The leaves became water-soaked, and were in a lump. Then,"|"['1.
