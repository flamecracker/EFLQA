Sutoto reached the peak and used a telescope to view the Unity village and Illyas' village. They visited the last captured village and were warmly welcomed by the chief. The village had transformed greatly, and a feast was held for John and the boys, bringing happiness to the people. The Illyas were seen working hard. The _Wonder_ ship returned to Unity while the _Pioneer_ headed to other islands. The crew experienced seasickness, trying a new cure called Atrophine. Its origin, administration, and effects were explained. The crew was relieved as the ship was driven off course but spotted land ahead. They anchored near a cove, where two boats were sent ashore, revealing signs of human habitation. They discovered coffee trees and marveled at the similarities in vegetation across distant lands.|"[""1.

Return to the landing was John's recommendation as they surveyed the island, noting the cardinal points of the compass. They laid out the coastline by triangulation, explaining the significance of measuring angles and transferring them to paper. Plans were made using a scale to ensure proportionate lengths of different angle limbs. Instructions were given to Sutoto, who was tasked with exploring the southern shore. The party equipped themselves with spears, bolos, a camera, and field glasses. They marveled at the lush tropical vegetation and fruit, even finding a stone hatchet. The boys ventured independently, leading to a temporary separation. George disappeared, prompting a search that revealed signs of a scuffle. His tracks were found, alongside native footprints. Muro scouted towards the natives, while a runner was sent to the ship. The _Pioneer_ sailed away, leaving the group to find a new landing spot, with Uraso informed of George's capture.|"['1.

The feast was a grand event, with John sharing the boys' story with the Chief, who was fascinated by the impressive ship. The island's unique tale unfolded, including a runner's journey to the ship and the absence of Krishnos. Sutoto spotted the runners and set sail for the village. The Chief's philosophy emphasized strength as the ultimate virtue, dismissing the idea of a great spirit. The boys were disheartened by the lack of caves and the presence of bad people to the north, their own kin turned convicts. The natives had peculiar beliefs, worshipping snakes and following witch doctors. The banquet menu revealed the natives' aversion to fish, shedding light on their unconventional ideas of right and wrong. The survey of the island's southern part involved advanced techniques like triangulation from the ship's mast.|"[""1.

Preparations were underway for the next adventure. After consulting the charts, the decision was made to sail northward towards Wonder Island. The shape of the island hinted that more land might lie to the north due to geological formations and upheavals. Sutoto was set to return to Wonder Island, accompanied by the Chief and his family. A visit to Hutoton was proposed before boarding the ship. Upon boarding, the convicts were welcomed, and the paralytic was taken aboard. Supplies were gathered from the ships for the convict colony as the _Pioneer_ set sail north. A new island was discovered, and observations were taken using the sun to determine the season. Triangulation and nautical charts were used to navigate, along with Greenwich time. The previous island was named _Venture_, while the new one boasted lush vegetation. John and the boys landed with two boatloads, forming exploration parties. Signs of savages and potential cannibals were discovered, leading to a tense standoff and eventual fight with the natives.|['1.

George reflected on the challenges they faced and the knowledge gained, expressing a willingness to relive it all. The conversation's significance hinges on understanding the boys' circumstances aboard a ship that met a calamity, leaving them stranded on an island.

Equipped with suitable tools, the group embarked on exploratory voyages, driven by the discovery of a lifeboat on the island. Their aim was to rescue their captured companions. On their first expedition, they encountered savage tribes, engaging in battles and capturing a wounded chief. Upon returning home, they found a white man named John, who, although initially devoid of intellect, became a skilled worker. Subsequent trips led to more encounters with tribes and the rescue of shipwrecked boys. John, an educated archaeologist, shared insights about hidden treasures on the islands. The group's unity and resourcefulness ultimately led to rescuing captured companions and establishing a peaceful town called Unity.

John ventured into the cave alone and managed to capture the Krishnos, a deceitful group, proving his suspicions right. Inside, they found a vast amount of treasure described in legends, but only discovered a copper deposit. Further exploration led to uncovering a storehouse of copper, indicating the cave's true purpose. Nearby, a unique village held the tribe captive, showcasing diverse architectural styles. The town of Unity, ten miles inland, operated a sawmill, foundry, and more, run by the natives. Blakely, a key figure, proposed cultivating crops for trade with the outside world. The boys, eager to reunite with their families after two years, worked together to build a ship for communication and commerce. Their efforts aimed to bring prosperity and unity to the island's inhabitants.|"['1.

In the same way, the Krishnos own large gun factories. They convince the chiefs that people across the river or on the other side of the mountain plan to rebel, urging them to arm their people for an attack. The white man's Krishnos operate in caves that act as gun factories. Although he doesn't sacrifice for pleasure, he produces guns, ammunition, and explosive shells as his trade. John chimed in, noting that while savages kill without rules, white men have structured the act of killing. The Professor smiled at John's explanation, but the boys seemed uncertain. George suggested that the savage approach might be more sensible. The Professor agreed that while it might not be the most reasonable, it is the most logical. They digressed from the topic, discussing the upcoming vessel launch. John declined to accompany them, preferring to stay with his people. The Professor graciously accepted an invitation to visit in the future. Angel, the Orang-outang, entered and handed the Professor an envelope. Angel was a remarkable figure in the community, adored by children and protected from harm. Though unable to speak, he comprehended most commands and performed exceptional tasks daily due to George's training. The Professor uncovered a dark-colored material from the envelope while reading its contents with John and the boys peering over his shoulder.|"[""1.

I was confident in my assessment of the mountain range below the town. Copper and silver deposits were visible in the area, promising a profitable venture for the locals. While exploring the southeastern side of the ridge, I discovered a fragment of a metal pot, possibly cast iron, along with other items of little value. Hidden within the pot fragment, protected by a rock shale, was an intriguing scrap that I thought might interest you. The men are in good spirits, and we anticipate returning soon. The marine pad we found seems to aid in celestial navigation for sailors. John recalled a mention of Wright, a former companion, but was puzzled by the unfamiliar name Walter. As we examined the V-shaped marks and arrow on the paper, we speculated about its significance, possibly indicating a location of ore deposits relative to a nearby landmark. This experience highlighted the value of hands-on learning and problem-solving, reinforcing the boys' independence and competence.|['1.

"The boys had important work to do at the shipyard. They were preparing to launch a vessel designed by Harry and supervised by John. The ship was ninety feet long, with a deep keel and high bulwarks, made of oak from the forest. The engine was for auxiliary use, and coal was to be used for the boiler. Upon returning to their rooms, the boys found a message with the words ""Take Head"" visible, hinting at a new adventure. Despite temptations to explore other islands first, they decided to head home before embarking on further journeys. The ship was successfully launched with the help of enthusiastic natives. Tears of pride were shed by the Professor as the community celebrated their achievement. Training a crew became the next challenge, with unmarried men selected for the task.

All the saved boys were aboard the ship, along with Blakely, at the Professor's insistence for business purposes. The Professor remained alone as the only white man on Wonder Island when the ship departed. Despite being surrounded by friendly natives, the boys sensed his loneliness. Unbeknownst to them, the Professor found solace in knowing he had aided others, regardless of their skin color. The voyage had favorable winds and ideal weather. They landed in Valparaiso, Chile, and later shipped on a steamer to reach Sandy Hook lightship within seven weeks. The boys were celebrated upon their return, especially Angel, who marveled at his first car ride. Despite opposition, the boys' parents allowed them to return due to their newfound maturity and self-reliance.

Despite the ship moving at full speed, the boys found it too slow. They spent most of their time with the Captain, a cheerful man who enjoyed their company. In late May, the ship approached Unity town. As they neared, the boys suggested saluting the town. The whistle blared, alerting the town's residents who rushed to the wharf. Welcomed warmly, the boys were carried on shoulders by the excited crowd. The former witch doctors, now teachers, were among the first to greet them. The boys shared stories with the people, who cherished the visit. Plans for a discovery voyage were discussed, using the ship _Pioneer_. The Professor assured the people of the boys' return.

The group decided to set out with a small force for immediate needs. If they encountered too many hostile locals on the discovered islands, they could either stay away or return with reinforcements. While preparing to depart, Blakely suggested loading part of the cargo with copper on the _Wonder_ and using both ships to transport it to the southeastern island. John was excited about this plan as he wanted to explore the coast near the copper deposit and see where Blakely had found the translated message. As they sailed east, they admired the Great South Mountains from the sea and marveled at the fireflies along the shore and mountainside. The cool light emitted by these giant glow birds fascinated them, sparking discussions about the mysteries of phosphorescent light and artificial lighting.

Upon reaching the ledge, towering six hundred feet above sea level, the group was overwhelmed by the stunning view of the sea below with anchored ships. Sutoto, in awe of the sight, was speechless and turned to grasp George's hand. All eyes turned to John, hoping for guidance. John carefully examined the surroundings, noticing a significant scratch on a shelf near a skull. He speculated that the markings might hold a cryptic message related to treasures or hidden wealth. Blakely added that the skull was not initially visible, indicating a mysterious connection between it and Walter's message. Despite the intriguing discoveries, the boys insisted on taking Sutoto to the peak for a breathtaking panoramic view, including the sight of South River to the north.|"[""1.

"Harry shouted, ""Let me have the glasses!"" He adjusted them and turned west, saying only, ""Unity,"" as he handed them to Sutoto. Looking through, Sutoto stepped back in surprise. George watched as Sutoto peered at a town over fifty miles away. Turning the glasses southeast, hoping to see treasures, they only saw a calm sea. They marveled at how calm it was compared to past storms. After viewing the island, they headed west and heard voices below. Sutoto shouted, recognizing friends. They visited a village they had conquered, greeted by Oma, who had changed. The village was transformed, clean and welcoming. They explored, finding familiar faces from Unity. Oma shared news of copper mines and a feast was held, celebrating the village's transformation."|"['1.

When the Chief and the men prepared to depart, they were joined by the Chief to witness their leaving at the shore beneath South Mountain. Before departing the village, items brought by ships for the Illyas were stored in the Chief's warehouse, and payments were made to those who had aided them. This occasion brought much joy. The sea was calm in the afternoon, offering a pleasant sail, but at night a strong breeze arose, varying in intensity. The next day, the sea turned choppy, causing over two-thirds of the natives to suffer from seasickness. John, along with the boys, administered a remedy discovered by Prof. Fischer and Dr. Reginald Pollard, which had remarkable effects, alleviating symptoms quickly. Despite sailing off course, the boys remained hopeful of reaching Wonder Island, eagerly searching for land but only spotting distant lights in the east, igniting excitement and anticipation among all onboard.|"['1.

The light ahead seemed distant but clear. John directed to sail south, away from the shore, hoping to see land clearly soon. As the dark hour passed, the dawn revealed an island. Confused by Walter's letter, they prepared to explore. John split the crew into two groups for safety. They rowed to the shore, then climbed cliffs to see a wooded landscape. Animals scattered at their arrival. John led them further, using binoculars to scan for signs of life. Finding none, they combed the area meticulously.|['1.

"The locals, usually eager to find signs of their presence, walked around but found no evidence. The land was elevated but not rough, except for the west coast. ""Why does cocoa thrive on one island but not the next, with bananas growing elsewhere?"" pondered Harry. The answer lies in the soil, which determines what plants can grow. Identical soil produces similar vegetation worldwide. The group spent hours searching the south without finding any human presence. They returned to the ship, planning to sail south, land every ten miles, explore the interior, and survey the island. Using triangulation, they measured distances on land and sea to map the island accurately."|['1.

John, along with the boys and a few locals, explored the shore and identified a point in the south for calculations. The ship sailed and anchored nearby to allow for surveying. After a day's work, the tired group returned to the ship. They observed the straight shoreline with a distant headland. The next day, they rowed to shore, leaving Uraso to guard the boat. John instructed the group on triangulation techniques using a sketch he had prepared. The party was well-equipped with guns, spears, knives, and provisions. As they ventured inland, they noticed the lush vegetation and wildlife. They reached a high point with a view of a valley and deer below. John and the boys were prepared for any encounters, with Harry carrying a camera and George a field glass.|['1.

One of the native scouts showed John an interesting stone formation, which turned out to be part of a stone hatchet. The scout confirmed this with a smile, providing evidence quickly. While crossing a rivulet, they found a clear print of a native foot, indicating they needed to find where the people were. The group split up along the stream, searching for clues. John whistled to gather the party, but George was missing. After a frantic search, they found signs of a scuffle near a rock. John sent a fast runner to get help and provisions. John believed they needed to head east or southeast to find the people, considering the weather patterns. Despite George's situation, they remained hopeful and planned their next steps carefully.|"['1.

John smiled as he nodded at Muro's explanation. It wasn't as bad as he thought. Muro asked to scout until Uraso arrived, taking Stut with him. They glided through the forest eastward, twelve miles from the boat. The runner would reach Uraso within an hour, and the group would return in about two more hours. Hasmo moved swiftly, aiming to reach the shore before 1 o'clock when the ship would depart. However, upon reaching the shore, the ship had already sailed. Hasmo tried to signal but was unnoticed. He had to follow the ship to the next landing. The journey was tough, navigating rocky cliffs and gulleys. Uraso gathered a crew, but Muro and Uraso didn't return. John awaited updates anxiously. George explored, finding rock formations that reminded him of Wonder Island. He was suddenly grabbed from behind.|"['1.

In the midst of the scuffle, George's hand brushed against the gun, which he managed to hold onto as he was pulled away by his captor. Despite having the gun in hand, he couldn't use it due to his restrained position. As he was being dragged, a whistle from John caught the captors off guard, revealing two nearly naked men. This distraction allowed George to swiftly raise the gun and fire, surprising everyone including his friends John and Harry. The shot momentarily stunned the savages, leading them to release George, but only briefly. Upon regaining consciousness later, George found himself surrounded by menacing savages who had taken his belongings as mere decorations. Despite being unarmed, George seized a moment of opportunity to reach for his revolver, only to be thwarted by a keen-eyed native who swiftly disarmed him.|"['1.

George smiled and showed the native a beautiful knife. The native admired it, turning it around and even using it as an ornament. George kept smiling, and the native smiled back. George then demonstrated how to open and close the knife, surprising the native. Next, George showed the savages a field glass, and after adjusting it, they were amazed by the distant view. George continued to impress them by teaching how to use the knife and field glass. He thought of showing them a match safe but decided to save it for later.

The man, George, found himself surrounded by a group of savages after a series of events. The savages inspected his belongings, and when they found his revolver, George became anxious. The Chief, a powerful and respected figure among them, picked up the revolver. George was worried about the Chief mishandling the weapon as it was an automatic, and any accidental trigger pull could lead to trouble.

George, a skilled marksman, demonstrated his shooting abilities to a group of intrigued onlookers, including the Chief. With precision, he shot a leaf and then guided the Chief to shoot at a tree, impressing the Chief with the accuracy of the shot. The Chief, amazed, questioned George about the bullet hole, prompting George to extract the bullet and demonstrate how it created the hole. When the Chief expressed interest in the knife used, George retrieved it from a reluctant captive.

The boy carefully removed a bullet and handed it to the Chief, along with a cartridge and an empty shell. He then placed a closed knife in the Chief's hand, standing back confidently. The Chief inspected the items, particularly interested in the cartridge belt. Perplexed by the large cartridges, the Chief signaled for the gun. The gun was swiftly produced by one of the men, surprising George with their skill in concealment. After a bird was shot down and presented to the Chief, George was handed back the gun, and the Chief chuckled in delight. They proceeded to the village, where George felt a sense of assurance rather than fear. The Chief's home stood out from the others, built with twigs and clay like the rest but cleaner.

The Chief's grand residence stood out among the neighboring homes. It featured a spacious courtyard, and the main dwelling had multiple rooms. George, feeling self-conscious, encountered two girls, several boys, and three women in the courtyard, all observing him. As the Chief reclined on a raised couch, George noticed unfamiliar items in the room, hinting at off-island origins. The duo cautiously navigated the forest, changing directions to avoid potential threats. They found traces of footprints but decided to resume tracking the next day. With the group now numbering thirty-five and well-equipped, they set out early the next morning to follow the trail. The scouts' keen eyes helped trace the path, leading them closer to their goal.

John confirmed the accuracy of the observations and mentioned how easy it would be for him to recognize each man in a crowd. Harry was intrigued and watched as Uraso and Muro, skilled scouts from the island, carefully navigated the ground, pointing out distinct footprints. They all shared a laugh at the scouts' abilities in English. Uraso identified twenty-five footprints, highlighting unique features like broad or long feet.

"George scanned the area and spotted the familiar bush. He broke off some twigs, crushed them with leaves, and washed up by the brook. Looking to the Chief's spot, he saw her gesture westward. Puzzled, he thought of Harry, John, and the boys from their expedition to Wonder Island. They affectionately called each other ""boys,"" including the natives Uraso and Muro.

John introduced Uraso and Muro as fellow Chiefs to the Chief through gestures, and the Chief respectfully acknowledged them.

On Wonder Island, Sutoto, the brave messenger, caught the eye of the Chief's daughter. At a feast, the boys witnessed the capture of thieves who stole from George. Urged by George, Uraso convinced the Chief to release them, showing forgiveness. The banquet featured wild fowl, boar, taro, and Brazil nuts, but no seafood due to the islanders' fear of sea creatures. The natives believed in Baigona, a mountain-dwelling God with mysterious powers. The island lacked significant rivers, and the Chief, unique for his lack of superstition, valued forgiveness over fear. This tale showcases the island's customs and beliefs, highlighting forgiveness and the importance of understanding different cultures.|"[""1.

In Wonder Island, the Chief Beralsee ruled with a unique approach. Unlike others who believed in tales of Medicine Men and witch doctors, he governed based on his will, unknown to him as law. Even though theft from George was allowed by the Chief, the boys faced guilt. Sutoto, a young man of the tribe, chose not to join the explorations, sparking curiosity among the boys. Beralsee's daughter, Cinda, known as the Beautiful Star, and his son, Calmo, played significant roles in the community.

The other island they were about to explore was long and narrow, unlike the circular shape of the one they had previously examined. The southern part they had studied had rolling terrain with some flat areas not exceeding three to four hundred feet above sea level. John was eager to meet the exiled people with criminal pasts. He was intrigued by the volcanic activity at the upper end, hinting at potential mineral discoveries. Gruesome tales circulated about the convicts' ferocity. John, who had saved some from exile, was seen as a savior. Once condemned, no return was allowed, and transgressors could never redeem themselves. John's interest in finding a specific cave sparked curiosity among his peers. They pondered the mysteries of Wonder Island and the missing crew from the _Investigator's_ No. 3 boat. The natives on both islands wore primitive attire, with men in simple breechcloths and Chiefs in additional shoulder coverings. Women donned short skirts and adorned themselves with various jewelry, indicating status and wealth through the number of bracelets worn.|"['1.

When the people on Wonder Island became prosperous, they began using more clothing to showcase their ornaments. Clothing was not just for covering or comfort but to display their desired trinkets. The shiny jewelry was highly sought after, regardless of the material. Women on a new island also adopted this trend. The Professor and George understood this cultural aspect and did not try to change it. The women on the island were skilled weavers, creating coarse but fashionable fabrics. The arrival of new products from the mainland enhanced their fashion sense. Immigrants introduced new dressing styles to the natives. Muro's wife played a key role in advancing her people's fashion.

Understanding the soil is crucial for farmers. Planting crops in unsuitable soil can lead to failure. Soil provides food for plants, and they can only thrive in soil with the right nutrients. Just like animals, plants need food they can digest. Trees, for example, digest their food before consuming it. Larvae also follow a similar process. Larvae are early forms of organisms before they fully develop, like tadpoles turning into frogs. Insects like grubs or caterpillars are examples of larvae. During an expedition, the boys encountered a bear. George shared honey with the bear, creating a fun and amusing scene. The boys explored the area, taking in the beautiful ocean views before camping for the night. The next morning, they enjoyed a refreshing swim at a nearby bay before continuing their journey.|['1.

Harry outpaced George, reaching the grassy hill first. As they traversed the debris, they stumbled upon an odd pile of brush. Digging through it, they uncovered a box-like structure covered in seaweed. Inside, they found their old tools and gourds of food, untouched but for the sea's wear and tear. Eager to share their discovery, Harry sprinted back to camp. Meanwhile, George unearthed a boat buried in the sand, revealing a skeleton with bullet wounds and a shortened leg, indicating a captive's tragic fate.

One puzzle was solved, and another more dreadful followed. The only option was to bury the skeleton after measuring it. They descended the slope, crossing the narrow land bridge between island sections. The terrain grew rougher as they advanced, with sporadic rocks. Despite this, lush vegetation thrived, offering abundant berries for all. While walking by a hill, Harry noticed a unique plant with rose-shaped flowers. John explained its ability to revive by absorbing water, common near the Dead Sea. As they climbed challenging hills on an unkempt path, they encountered the Chief's son. George and Harry engaged him with Sutoto's help, sharing wonders and marvels. Amidst a humorous exchange, they discovered the Upas tree's exaggerated reputation for harmful exudations.|"['1.

As they continued their ascent, the vast sea could be seen on both sides. In the distance loomed the mountain, surrounded by rocky terrain. John paused to collect mineral samples from the gray walls, noting the richness of the hills. Upon reaching the summit, a green landscape stretched northward, captivating their interest. Intrigued by the mountain's potential, they set up camp for the night. The cool breeze and soothing scents brought tranquility, prompting discussions on ancient punishments like banishment. The next day, they organized search parties to explore the mountain, reveling in the freedom and joy of the beautiful surroundings. The impact of pleasant odors on happiness was discussed, highlighting their influence on dreams and well-being.|['1.

Several expeditions were meant to regroup at noon in the camp, signaling with gunshots in case of emergencies. George had two of his own helpers and two locals, while Harry was accompanied by his favorites, eager and energetic for the search. George's area had more limestone rocks, likely to hide caves. He found entrances that turned out to be dead ends, common in rocky terrains. Real caves form when water erodes calcium in limestone. George decided to descend closer to sea level for a better chance. After searching for hours, they found an open cave mouth. They entered cautiously, following a narrow path in single file. John doubted the cave's depth, but George persisted in exploring further. The group spent the night on the mountain and ventured north the next day. They encountered surprised locals in a lush woodland, signaling a new chapter in their exploration.|"['1.

As they strolled down the main street, Anasa led the boys past neatly arranged huts with blooming flowers and vegetable patches. Pausing at a charming hut, Anasa motioned for the boys to follow inside. There, they encountered a villager and two women. Anasa seemed confident the boys would recognize the villager as one of their own. George extended his hand in greeting, but the man responded listlessly, indicating his paralysis. The boys learned that the villagers had found and cared for him for over two years. John, intrigued, inspected the man and pondered the situation. Despite the language barrier, they communicated about the man's condition and the villagers' kindness.

The boys were deeply moved by the revelations about society's treatment of criminals. They learned that criminals were banished to foreign lands to work on bettering themselves. John explained how this approach aimed to help them rather than just punishing them. He drew a comparison to treating criminals like people with infectious diseases, arguing that society should focus on rehabilitation rather than isolation. The boys observed the contrast between the clean and orderly village of Hutoton and the disorderly Sasite. As they prepared to leave, they spotted a sail on the horizon, signaling the arrival of the _Pioneer_. Excitedly, they headed back to the village, eager for the next chapter of their adventure.|"[""1.

In the tribe of Berees, marriage customs were strict. The Chief held authority, and marrying without his consent led to exile. Sutoto, a Berees member, sought to marry Cinda, a woman from Wonder Island. The Chief initially disapproved of their plan to wed secretly. However, after persuasion, he agreed to the match. The tribe's marriage ritual was unique. The groom had to bring fruit, fowl, and game blindfolded to the bride. They had to prepare a meal without speaking. If they made a sound, they would part ways. The next test involved conversing without pause. This tradition symbolized entering marriage blindly and silently. John noted similarities with customs from central Africa.|"[""1.

The Chief was unfamiliar with the land ahead, having only heard tales of dangerous inhabitants. John steered the vessel along the coast, using binoculars to survey the lush vegetation but no signs of civilization. After rounding a point, they reached a cove where they disembarked in two groups, led by Muro and Uraso. The boys accompanied Uraso, while John joined Muro. The plan was for the groups to explore east and northeast for three hours before converging to share findings. John's choice to head east hinted at his interest in caves, drawing a laugh from his companions. As they ventured further, they discovered signs of tribal presence, like animal bones near old fire pits.

The terrain was not flat but filled with half-grown forests making it hard to navigate quietly. Suddenly, a barrage of arrows surprised them, injuring two men. Muro, calm and collected, removed an arrow from his arm. As they faced a hundred savages, Muro decided to fire back, causing chaos. Despite being surrounded, the savages hesitated to attack. Muro tried to communicate peace but was met with hostility. He instructed the group to be ready for a close combat if needed. After a tense standoff, Muro scouted the enemy's positions and devised a plan. They slowly moved towards a fallen tree to create a defensive position. With a hundred and fifty savages surrounding them, a fight was inevitable. The group prepared to defend themselves as the savages closed in, ready for a night of battle.|"['1.

Muro decided to take action to attract the watchers. He chose three boys to crawl forward and attack the enemy. After hearing shots, they repeated the maneuver, causing chaos among the besiegers. The boys, though experienced in tough situations, grew pale as the savages charged forward.

"Suddenly, amidst the chaos of battle, a loud sound pierced the air, drowning out the crackling of weapons and the cries of the enemy. Shots were being fired. The savages, taken aback, turned to face the unexpected threat. The attack halted, and Muro, with a fierce cry, leaped onto a log. The boys, startled by the turn of events, struggled to react. Another round of gunfire echoed, growing louder. The savages, now in disarray, could be seen rushing through the brush.

John, assessing the situation, explained, ""We heard the first shots an hour ago and changed direction. Then, silence. As we approached, we heard more shots and saw smoke, with the savages closing in."" As the wounded were tended to, John and Muro kept a watchful eye on the savages, preparing for any further encounters. The group, now aware of the savage force nearby, made their way back to the safety of the ship, avoiding further confrontation."|"[""1.

John and the Chief appeared before the boys at the beach, informing them that the tribe was following to recover the Chief taken along. Shots were fired to alert a boat, and runners quickly updated the Professor. Two boatloads of warriors were sent ashore. The wounded Chief received urgent care. A plan was made to explore and conquer the natives. The _Pioneer_ sailed to Wonder Island for supplies and reinforcements. Fifty-five men with ammunition stayed. Uraso and Muro joined the party. A council decided to head east to confront the nearby tribe. A post office station was set up for communication. The party, equipped with ammunition and shelter, prepared to face the hostile tribe.

John carefully organized the force to ensure it was always ready for action. He divided the fighters into two squads led by Uraso and Muro, with each squad taking turns patrolling for two days. As they journeyed through a lush landscape, they encountered evidence of human presence, like a hut with a chilling display of decaying human skulls. Exploring further, they discovered a rattle believed to have mystical powers. The rattle, called a vele, was used to curse enemies in a ritual that involved pointing the rattle at the victim while shaking it and uttering curses. The boys heard eerie cries at night, unsettling everyone. Uraso and Muro's scouting revealed a sizable and hostile population nearby, prompting a council to discuss their next steps given the limited force available.|"['1.

Muro expressed his surprise at the approaching warriors after their recent battle, suggesting they were numerous. John proposed two options: continue with their current men or wait for the _Pioneer_ to return and gather a larger force. They aimed to win over the locals peacefully, but their small numbers posed a challenge. They quickly packed up camp, skipping breakfast, to avoid conflict. Uraso led the rear guard while the main group crossed the valley. They noticed drum signals from the savages, indicating they were being watched. Uraso's group was soon under pressure from the natives. John, George, and Harry hurried to establish a defense near the landing site. The boys encountered hostile natives but managed to fight them off. They eventually reached safety aboard the ship, observing the natives' defiance from a distance.
