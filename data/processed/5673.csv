Nick Holden, a young man, wanted Philip's fiddle, believing it would make him popular with girls. Philip, valuing his independence, declined. Nick then tried to buy it at an auction, offering to settle a debt with Philip's father in exchange. However, Philip refused, as the violin was a gift from a family friend and not his father's property. Despite Nick's efforts, Philip held onto the violin, proud of his self-sufficiency.

Nicholas saw an opportunity to acquire a gold watch inexpensively at an auction. He believed he could purchase it below its actual value and later sell it for a profit. Despite the auctioneer's intentions to maximize profits and Philip's friends' interests, Nicholas was determined to bid on the watch. He also planned to bid on Philip's violin, confident that no one else would compete. Squire Pope, convinced of his superior judgment, insisted on sending Philip to the poorhouse, disregarding the boy's objections. Although the auction proceeds could cover expenses without selling the violin, Squire Pope insisted on its sale. To protect the watch from being taken, Philip asked Mr. Dunbar to safeguard it until he could afford to reclaim it, valuing it as a memento of his late father.

Leaving Philip briefly with his captor, let's follow Zeke on his task. He didn't need to reach Mr. Dunbar's house as he encountered Frank Dunbar a short distance before it.

Zeke assured Frank that he had no involvement in Philip's situation and that he promised to inform Frank's family. Philip found himself in a boarding-house room feeling like a prisoner.

Mrs. Tucker was wide awake when Frank Dunbar arrived. She overheard a conversation between the two boys through the partially open window but couldn't make out the words.

His wife rushed to his side, concerned. Meanwhile, in a pasture-lot, a farmer, living alone, was attacked by a tramp.

In the spacious Schoolhouse Hall on the second floor of the Center Schoolhouse, Philip, a young and handsome boy, prepared to play the violin for a dancing party. Despite his youthful appearance, Philip's neat attire and good looks caught everyone's attention. Some doubted his musical abilities, like Jedidiah, who hoped Philip would fail to impress.
