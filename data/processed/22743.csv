As the sun dipped behind the hills casting long shadows, two girls in an auto were approached by a group led by a hag. The hag, pleased with a suggestion, gave commands to her companions. The younger woman handed over a sleeping infant to the hag and the group moved on, leaving the girls behind. Feeling uneasy in the growing darkness, the strangers offered to take the girls to a nearby town in their wagon. Despite initial suspicions, the girls decided to go with them for safety. The interior of the wagon was surprisingly cozy with sleeping berths and colorful quilts. The girls hesitantly climbed in, the door closed, and the journey began into the unknown.|['1.

In a cozy van, Ruth and Helen encountered an eerie scene. A child slept peacefully, guarded by a snarling poodle at their feet. The most astonishing sight was an ancient crone with piercing eyes and a crooked posture, resembling a mystical figure. The crone, known as Queen Zelaya, spoke of wealth and power, hinting at a hidden connection to Roberto's grandmother. Despite the initial fear, Ruth and Helen were reassured by Queen Zelaya's words, feeling a sense of protection despite the mysterious aura surrounding her. The encounter with the old Romany woman left the girls intrigued and somewhat wary, unsure of the true intentions behind the mystical persona.|"['1.

"""Come!"" urged Zelaya. ""Tell me about the wealth and jewels - the gold and silver plates you use, the jewelry you wear, the luxurious silks - all of it! I enjoy hearing about such things,"" the woman exclaimed, grinning in a frightening manner. Ruth clutched her friend Helen tightly. Helen, who was laughing, suddenly fell silent. The queen's intimidating gaze seemed to mesmerize the girl. Unintentionally, Helen found herself drawn towards the back of the van. The hag cackled once more, sending a chill down the girls' spines. Even though she wasn't looking at them, her laughter seemed to penetrate their thoughts. The old woman continued her cackling. ""Oh, no! Oh, no!"" she exclaimed. ""The pretty, wealthy young ladies cannot leave yet. They must stay a little longer as my guests - they must share a meal with me. Then they will be my friends - and perhaps they will help me become wealthy."" Ruth doubted this. She attempted to peer out of a window and noticed a bonfire and what appeared to be a tent. There were other wagons similar to the one they were in. The van's door was unlocked and opened, revealing a rough-looking man with a sinister face and a squint in one eye.

Ruth, showing courage despite the pain, scolded the old Gypsy woman for breaking the laws of the land. She settled Helen into a berth and sat beside her. Later, a bold young woman brought them savory stew. The queen quickly ate her meal and retired to her bunk, instructing the girls to do the same. Ruth lay with her head toward the door, watching the old woman's movements. Zelaya, pretending to sleep, secretly unlocked a box and revealed a dazzling pearl necklace. Ruth recalled hearing two supposed tramps discuss stolen treasure during a storm. She wondered if this old woman was one of them. Meanwhile, Tom, troubled about his car, sought help at a farmhouse but was met with furious barking from inside. He looked disheveled from his attempts to fix his car in the rain.|"['1.

The boy, unaware of becoming the brute's dinner, kicked out, barely touching it. The beast howled and fled into the darkness. It seemed the Blodgetts kept it for its bark, lacking courage. Tom and Mr. Blodgett retraced their steps, the horses' harness jingling. They found no trace of the girls. Tom called out and searched the car. Only personal items were taken. Perplexed, Tom thought no thieves had been there. They arrived at Severn Corners at ten, a dimly lit hamlet. Blodgett mentioned the local blacksmith could fix cars. Tom realized the constable, Sim Peck, lived next door. He decided to seek help for his missing sister and Ruth. The moonless night made it hard to navigate the dark village streets as Tom knocked on Sim Peck's door for assistance.|"['1.

Late one night, Tom faced a grumpy blacksmith who refused to help fix his car. The constable threatened to arrest the blacksmith if he didn't assist.

Luckily, the damage wasn't severe, and the blacksmith fixed it efficiently. Tom and the constable then continued their journey.

Ruth eagerly searched for Roberto among the Gypsies, hoping for protection. Although the Gypsies didn't seem unkind, none were friendly. The woman who helped capture them took them to wash up and provided toiletries. No one bothered them or their belongings. After breakfast, Ruth whispered to Helen about what she saw. They were closely watched by everyone in the camp, even children. Ruth assured Helen they'd defend themselves if needed. The men returned, appearing angry and scared. The Queen scolded them. Ruth noticed a beautiful necklace with a unique pendant. When commotion started, Ruth and Helen escaped into the woods, heading towards a fishing punt.

At the edge of the lake, a group of Gypsy men and a woman emerged from the brush. The woman, who had tricked Ruth and Helen the night before, found Ruth in a difficult situation and laughed. However, the men were not amused. One man moved aggressively towards Ruth, but the woman intervened, standing up to him. As the woman and man argued in their language, another Gypsy boy tried to catch a drifting boat with Helen inside. Suddenly, a cry from their camp made the men retreat. The woman and man took Ruth into the bush, and the camp became chaotic as they prepared to leave. Queen Zelaya, in charge, made Ruth change into different clothes and applied strange lotions to her skin. Ruth, feeling lonely but not yet worried, wondered about her fate with the Gypsy queen.|"['1.

The caravan had journeyed far the night before, and Ruth couldn't estimate the distance since the girls had joined the Gypsies. Now, they were swiftly heading towards Boisé Landing by Long Lake. Ruth worried about potential pursuit, especially if Tom had alerted his father, Mr. Cameron, who would come searching for Helen without delay. Ruth was certain that trouble awaited the Gypsies if the searchers discovered they had taken the girls. Even Uncle Jabez would take action if he knew. Suddenly, the caravan stopped, and there was commotion as the other vans emptied. Ruth was pushed out by Old Zelaya, and the Gypsies welcomed her with noisy excitement, drowning out any screams she might have made.

She quickly dashed through the group of kids, pushing the brave girl down as she shouted for help. Suddenly, a man stopped her, turned her around, covered her mouth, and glared menacingly at her. It was the man with the evil eyes who had spied on Queen Zelaya the previous evening. Ruth was speechless and frozen in place. The man seemed capable of doing what he threatened. Laughing, he taunted Ruth about her fate. The group headed towards the lake, with the horses wading through the water. Ruth was puzzled about their destination as they seemed to be heading towards an island. The Gypsies were familiar with the lake's shallow area, guiding the horses accurately. Arriving at the wooded island, everyone disembarked, preparing for their camp. Queen Zelaya's men were stationed on both shores to keep watch.|"['1.

Tents were pitched, fires lit, and a grand feast commenced while the Gypsy children gleefully watched a kid and a calf playfully butting heads. Suddenly, a man's shout from the shore caused a stir. A figure emerged from the bushes into the camp, sparking great emotion in the old woman who embraced him warmly in their native tongue. Despite glances from the boy Roberto, Ruth saw no sign of recognition. As Roberto bid farewell to the queen, he headed straight for Ruth. Anxious yet hopeful, Ruth stood up as he approached. Meanwhile, Helen, adrift in a boat, wept at her helplessness, fearing for Ruth's safety with the Gypsies. Drifting towards turbulent waters, Helen's thoughts were consumed by the danger that lay ahead.|"['1.

When Ruth and her friends arrived at Severn Corners hoping to find her at the constable's house, they were let down. Instead of finding her, they saw Sim Peck working at the forge, shoeing a horse with a hammer in hand. Although Roberto seemed to show some friendliness with whispered promises, he later ignored her, making Ruth feel ashamed of her appearance.

Ruth Fielding followed the instructions she was given. She passed through the gate, stepped onto the porch, and knocked on the kitchen door. As soon as she saw the kind face of the woman who opened the door, Ruth knew that her problems were resolved. A week had gone by since Ruth and Helen were held captive by the Gypsies in the hills. It had been a week full of excitement and adventure for Ruth, Helen, and Tom Cameron. They had many stories to share about the Gypsies and their customs in the weeks ahead. After Ruth arrived at Severn Corners with the help of a farmer, the County Sheriff and his team were alerted. Constable Peck, after searching the Gypsy camp, believed Ruth had escaped with Helen. Only after Ruth narrated her full story did the authorities begin pursuing the Gypsies. Queen Zelaya and her group had left the county and even the state, heading south for the winter. Ruth, Helen, and Tom had a lot to catch up on during that week. They pondered Roberto's fate and the mysterious pearl necklace Ruth had seen in Queen Zelaya's possession. Despite all the adventures, Ruth felt a mix of emotions leaving the kind Aunt Alvirah and the grumpy Uncle Jabez at the Red Mill. Uncle Jabez handed Ruth some money, a gesture that Ruth believed was his awkward way of showing kindness.|['1.

Ruth's uncle values her presence as it warms his heart despite giving her money. Ruth rushes out with her new handbag to join Helen and Tom in the Cameron automobile. Aunt Alvirah's words linger in Ruth's mind as she refrains from returning the money. At the station, Mercy Curtis awaits them. The group boards the train with Heavy Stone and The Fox, engaging in lively chatter. The Fox's sharp remarks about Ruth's red hair spark conversation.
