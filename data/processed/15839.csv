Kathleen mentioned that she would cover the expenses and asked the girls to support her. The next day, Cassandra was called to see Miss Ravenscroft, the headmistress. Cassandra, known for her composure, was respected by her peers. Florence, one of her admirers, was also in her class. Cassandra felt honored to meet Miss Ravenscroft, unlike Kathleen who was annoyed. Miss Ravenscroft mentioned a group named the Wild Irish Girls led by Kathleen, causing unrest in the school. Miss Ravenscroft wanted details but Ruth, a member, hesitated to share.

""There you are!"" said Miss Ravenscroft. ""Think of the monstrous mischief that is going on in our midst.
