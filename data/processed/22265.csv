Frank carefully examined the bill of sale for the yacht _White Wings_ that Parker Flynn claimed ownership of. Merriwell pointed out that the sale was invalid because Fergus Fearson, the supposed seller, was unable to confirm it due to being in a mental institution.

"As the large ship passed by, the boys noticed that most passengers were still asleep after a night journey from Boston. ""I won't tolerate any more trouble from him,"" Frank declared. ""And Wat Snell will regret crossing me. I'll make sure of that!"" Diamond agreed, ""You're right, Frank. Snell might be easier to deal with than Flynn, who seems more dangerous."" When Flynn fired a shot, Snell quickly fled, disappearing behind the ship. The boys speculated that Flynn and Snell's presence together wasn't a coincidence.

At that moment, the small boat was nearing the yacht, allowing everyone to see and observe the people on board. Wat Snell appeared pale and uncomfortable. The man claiming to be the sheriff had a rough appearance, resembling a fighter. The person operating the boat seemed uninterested in getting involved in any potential conflict. His sole purpose was to transport the others to the _White Wings_. The large man with whiskers was the first to try and board the yacht but was swiftly thrown back into the launch by Bruce Browning. The scrappy man on the launch then leaped onto the yacht's deck and engaged in a scuffle with Jack Diamond. Despite Diamond's skills, the man proved to be a tough opponent. Amidst the chaos, Hans lost control of the yacht, causing the boom to swing and accidentally hit Diamond's adversary, momentarily incapacitating him. Flynn, realizing the difficulty of the situation, seemed to lose his initial determination to board the yacht. Snell and Flynn's encounter stemmed from Snell spying on Frank and his friends in Boston, eventually gaining Flynn's trust.|"['1.

The boy on the wharf was astonished when he saw Frank, his jaw dropping in disbelief. After a moment of awe, he suddenly bolted out of sight. Frank and his friends left the wharf and walked quickly up Bay View Street. As they approached the bank building at the public square, they saw a group of small boys running down Elm Street, led by the boy who had vanished from the wharf.

After dinner, most of the boys, except Hans who headed to the _White Wings_ ship, gathered at Bay View. A spacious buckboard arrived for a joyride, surprising Merry as he was invited along with Browning, Diamond, and Hodge. The group also included members of the Camden ball team. The driver whipped the four horses, and off they went through town, up Harbor Hill, and along the road towards the mountains. As twilight set in, they traveled on the renowned turnpike with Battie behind them and Megunticook's towering heights above. The drive offered stunning views, passing by Maiden Cliff with its poignant white cross marking a tragic incident. They circled back via Lake City, admiring the moonlit scenery and learning about the history of the area, including the former Lake City Inn. Night had fallen, but the full moon illuminated the landscape, creating a magical atmosphere.

Before they arrived at the base of the mountain from leaving Lake City, they turned onto a path leading back into the forest. They soon reached a newly constructed road, a project driven by the clever hotel owner on the hill. This road exceeded the boys' expectations but had steep sections, forcing everyone except Browning to walk. Bruce refused to get off his horse despite teasing. Moonlight filtered through the trees, casting white patches among the dark shadows. The boys perspired as they climbed, but they persevered until they reached the hotel lights. Below, the village, harbor, bay, and vast countryside spread out under the moonlight. The town twinkled with lights, and a trolley car sped between Rockport and Camden. The boys were welcomed at the hotel, where a group of girls from the village was also present. Despite initial reluctance, the girls' chaperone agreed to let them dance. The ball ground was packed with fans as the Camden team arrived late, led by a group of enthusiastic rooters.

Frank and Jack were on a yacht heading towards Devil Island. Jack surprised Frank by insisting on joining the investigation despite Frank's objections. They anchored near the island to avoid detection. Frank was concerned about the yacht sitting in the mud during low tide but knew it would be fine at high tide. They found large clams on the beach, with the first one being seven inches long. Hans, a crew member, joked about the clam looking like an Irishman's face. They collected clams for a clambake on Devil Island, where they built an oven and gathered wood and seaweed. Hans couldn't shake off the image of the clam resembling an Irishman, adding humor to the adventure.|"[""1.

"Merriwell's pals observed him closely, intrigued by his reaction. Although Frank appeared cheerful, a hint of uncertainty clouded his expression. Facing a dilemma for the first time, he hesitated. The jovial old man's demeanor somehow deterred any thoughts of harm. Bruce Browning sensed this too. He felt a sense of shame at the idea of causing the man any distress. Cooler's presence seemed unshakeable, unfazed by any attempts to intimidate him. ""Ahem!"" coughed the gray-clad man. ""That's right, young man—allow me to gather these clams before you dampen my spirits. Perhaps a brief respite after this would be wise; bathing on a full stomach is ill-advised. It's not good for the health, according to medical experts."" The group, excluding Hans, resumed their clam feast, while Hans brooded alone, occasionally glaring at the man in gray. Cooler effortlessly conversed while indulging in clams, sharing tales of his extensive travels worldwide. ""Young man,"" exclaimed Cooler, ""you surprise me.

Frank observed Mr. Cooler closely. If he hadn't been convinced that the man was pretending, he might have enjoyed his talk. However, Frank saw through his facade and was sure that Mr. Cooler was not genuine. Frank had never heard of the Bay Islands Land Company and doubted its existence. He suspected that Cooler was a spy sent by those trying to force them off the island. Frank thought Cooler was part of a criminal gang willing to commit murder to hide their deeds. Despite his suspicions, Cooler joked and praised the clambake, sharing stories about his wife and her interest in cycling. He laughed heartily and assured the boys he was harmless, comparing himself to a lion in jest.|"[""1.

He lit his pipe and chatted while smoking. Frank thought about questioning him to know why he was there. Suddenly, the man jumped up, saying he needed to finish his investigation of the island and prepare to leave when someone returned for him. He thanked them for their hospitality and left. Frank considered stopping him, but decided to let him go. The man, Mr. Cooler, walked ahead, unaware he was being followed. Frank followed him discreetly, noting the man's carefree demeanor. Frank knew that criminals often reveal themselves through their behavior. He observed Mr. Cooler's relaxed posture and lack of suspicion. Frank recalled the recent danger he faced when a railcar nearly hit him, saved by Browning.

Once before, a sense of desolation had gripped him strongly, and now that eerie feeling was returning. It seemed like he was far from civilization, lost in a desolate expanse of water, stranded on a mysterious island. He whispered to himself, aware that the dark and ominous woods were nearby. To reach the _White Wings_, he had to venture through them or retrace his steps to take a different path, risking encountering the men he had been observing. Denning, like Frank Merriwell, had been curious about the island's mystery and had vanished, with his grave later discovered on the island. No one dared open the grave to check if Denning's body lay within. Frank felt compelled to revisit the grave, heading toward it through the silent and deserted woods. Each step intensified the eerie sensation. The woods appeared devoid of life except for Frank. As he neared the grave, he noticed fresh marks on the stone, with Denning's name chiseled out and a new name added below. Diamond expressed concern about Frank venturing alone on the island, recalling past incidents. Hans regretted letting Frank go alone, while Browning, usually nonchalant, was anxious due to a recent near-death experience involving Frank. Diamond wanted to search for Frank immediately, but Hodge hesitated, respecting Merry's instructions.|"['1.

Browning felt relieved when he didn't see Merriwell's body on the railroad track. He feared the worst, thinking the villains had captured his friend. They headed to the old boarding house, which appeared deserted and forbidding. The sun's rays made the place look desolate. Browning believed Frank was targeted to eliminate trouble. As they approached the dark woods, Browning felt a familiar unease. They moved cautiously, mimicking each other's stealth. At the edge of the glade, Bruce stared at the grave, sensing a connection to Frank's disappearance. Despite doubts, Browning remained hopeful they would find Frank alive.

The boat gently swayed with the rising tide, and on board were Dunnerwust and Diamond, but Merriwell was nowhere in sight. Diamond and Dunnerwust hopped into a nearby rowboat with their guns and rowed to shore with Hans. Bart and Bruce joined them, sharing their recent findings. Suddenly, a familiar voice interrupted their conversation. The man in gray strolled down the bank, addressing the startled boys.
