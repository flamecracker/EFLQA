"In some schools, setting up a special room for Household Management work isn't always possible. The regular classroom is used instead. In such cases, portable equipment is needed since gas stoves and plumbing are not available. Tabletops can be placed on trestles or across desks, and oil or alcohol lamps are used. The necessary utensils can be stored in a cupboard in the room. Classes in these schools are usually smaller, so an outfit suitable for individual work with a class of twelve is sufficient. The Macdonald Institute in Guelph suggests a basic list of items that can be adjusted as needed. When the cost of modified equipment is too high, a simpler ""packing-box"" set suitable for six students can be created using items like bread boards, baking pans, and kitchen tools. Planning and organization are crucial in Household Management classes to ensure that tasks are completed efficiently and without confusion. Students are expected to maintain cleanliness, wear proper uniforms, and follow classroom rules."|"['Question 1:\nWhat is the reason for using portable equipment in some schools for Household Management classes?\nA) To save space\nB) Due to lack of gas stoves and plumbing\nC) To encourage creativity\nD) To make the classes more challenging\nE) To reduce costs', 'Question 2:\nHow are tabletops used in schools where a special room for Household Management is not available?\nA) They are used for studying only\nB) They are used for storing utensils\nC) They are placed on trestles or across desks\nD) They are used for displaying projects\nE) They are used for seating arrangements', 'Question 3:\nWhat is the purpose of storing necessary utensils in a cupboard in the classroom?\nA) To keep the classroom organized\nB) To prevent theft\nC) To make them easily accessible\nD) To display them to students\nE) To showcase different utensils', 'Question 4:\nHow does the Macdonald Institute suggest adjusting the basic list of items for Household Management classes?\nA) By increasing the number of students\nB) By decreasing the number of utensils\nC) By adding more expensive equipment\nD) By modifying the list as needed\nE) By using only gas stoves', 'Question 5:\nWhat is the purpose of creating a ""packing-box"" set for six students in some schools?\nA) To increase costs\nB) To simplify the equipment\nC) To make the classes more advanced\nD) To discourage creativity\nE) To accommodate more students', 'Question 6:\nWhat is emphasized as crucial in Household Management classes according to the text?\nA) Creativity\nB) Uniformity\nC) Planning and organization\nD) Classroom rules\nE) Class size']"|['B) Due to lack of gas stoves and plumbing', 'C) They are placed on trestles or across desks', 'C) To make them easily accessible', 'D) By modifying the list as needed', 'B) To simplify the equipment', 'C) Planning and organization']
During practical lessons, students should have the freedom to talk and move around, but they must remember to respect others and maintain order. It is important to have a quiet and attentive environment for learning. Punctuality and good work are encouraged through interest and happiness in the tasks. Practical lessons typically last one and a half hours, covering both theory and hands-on activities. Students can copy notes while waiting for food to cook, giving them a chance to rest. Group and individual work methods are used, with group work often involving cleaning together. Supplies can be shared, and students can bring ingredients from home for certain lessons.

"**Lesson on Measuring for Middle School Students**

Today, we will learn about measuring and how to use different measures effectively. To start, we will explore how to measure a teaspoonful of flour accurately. By asking a few students to measure from a bowl, we will see the importance of leveling measures. We will discuss how to level both dry and liquid ingredients. Additionally, we will learn how to measure less than a spoonful and how to divide a spoonful into halves, quarters, and eighths. We will also examine the divisions of a cup and understand which ingredients should be measured first when using one measure for both liquids and dry items. As we progress, we will create a table of measures to understand the relationships between different measures, such as how many teaspoonfuls fill a tablespoon and how many tablespoons fill a cup. Finally, we will practice these concepts by following a simple recipe, like making cocoa, to reinforce our understanding of measuring both liquids and dry ingredients accurately."|['1. **What is the main focus of the lesson on measuring for middle school students?**\nA) Cooking techniques\nB) Mathematical equations\nC) Measuring accurately\nD) Baking history\nE) Science experiments', '2. **Why is leveling measures important when measuring ingredients?**\nA) To make the ingredients taste better\nB) To avoid spills\nC) To ensure accurate measurements\nD) To speed up the process\nE) To impress the teacher', '3. **How do we divide a spoonful when measuring ingredients?**\nA) Halves, thirds, and sixths\nB) Halves, quarters, and eighths\nC) Quarters, fifths, and tenths\nD) Thirds, sixths, and twelfths\nE) Quarters, halves, and thirds', '4. **What will students learn about the divisions of a cup?**\nA) How to drink from a cup\nB) How to measure liquids only\nC) How to measure dry ingredients only\nD) How to divide a cup into equal parts\nE) How to divide a cup into halves, quarters, and eighths', '5. **What relationship will students understand by creating a table of measures?**\nA) The relationship between baking and cooking\nB) The relationship between time and temperature\nC) The relationship between different measures\nD) The relationship between ingredients and utensils\nE) The relationship between measuring and mixing', '6. **How will students reinforce their understanding of measuring both liquids and dry ingredients?**\nA) By watching a movie\nB) By following a simple recipe\nC) By discussing theoretical concepts\nD) By taking a quiz\nE) By writing an essay']|['C) Measuring accurately**', 'C) To ensure accurate measurements**', 'B) Halves, quarters, and eighths**', 'E) How to divide a cup into halves, quarters, and eighths**', 'C) The relationship between different measures**', 'B) By following a simple recipe**']

In cooking tea, steep the leaves for three to five minutes, then strain them from the liquid. Boiling tea is not recommended as it can remove flavor. Coffee beans also contain tannin and a stimulant. Grinding the beans causes the flavor to deteriorate, so grind them as needed or store in airtight containers. Coffee can be made in different ways depending on the size of the beans. Small pieces of beans may float, clouding the liquid, but this can be fixed by using egg-white. When serving food in a cooking class, ensure the table is clean, and each student has their own space. Neatness in table setting and good manners while eating should be emphasized. Teaching table setting can be introduced after students can prepare a simple meal. Place plates with cutlery about an inch from the edge of the table. Reviewing cooking and cleaning methods from the previous year is essential, and new recipes should be practical for home use.|"['1.

Students will now transition from managing individual table stoves to learning about coal or wood ranges. Two lessons are needed for this. After each lesson, time should be spent on practical tasks like making tea, cleaning drawers, or drawing designs. To introduce the lesson on kitchen fires, students can imagine moving into a new house that needs cleaning. They will learn that hot water is best for cleaning and that a fire is needed for hot water. By using a candle and lamp chimney, they will discover that oxygen is essential for a fire. They will also learn that heat is needed for things to burn. Finally, students will identify the four requisites for a kitchen fire: fuel, stove, oxygen, and heat.|['1.

It is crucial to handle substances like gasolene, coal-oil, or benzine with care due to their low burning temperature. Emphasize to students that heat is what causes fuel to burn, not necessarily a flame. Moving on to fuels, a basic comparison can be made regarding cost and the effort needed to use them. Students can brainstorm and sketch their ideal stove on the board before critiquing school and home stoves. They can then be tasked with managing a regular range. Dampers, like the front damper to regulate oxygen, oven damper for heat control, and check damper for airflow, should be understood. Additionally, the importance of labor-saving tools in household management should be highlighted, including the fireless cooker. This device utilizes heated stone plates to cook food in a liquid or dry method. Students can practice by setting up the cooker with a granite pail surrounded by sawdust or excelsior for efficient cooking.|['1.

"The students have been working with familiar foods in their recipes and should know how to prepare them easily. Now, it's time for them to understand the nutrients these foods provide for their bodies. This part of the lesson can be taught in regular classrooms without special tools. A dedicated teacher can make this study engaging and valuable with just a few items from home. Several lessons will be needed for this. Teachers should decide how much content to cover in one go. After theory discussions, the remaining class time should focus on practical activities. For example, learning about ""The Kitchen Fire"" on page 92. The lesson can start by asking how a healthy baby's body changes after six months of regular feeding. The body grows larger, with more flesh, bone, and hair. The term ""tissue"" is used to describe the fine texture of body parts, like hair tissue or bone tissue. Food helps build and repair body tissues, providing strength and energy by burning inside the body, just like fuel in a fire. Food also produces heat and energy in the body."|"[""1.

Food serves multiple purposes in our bodies, including regulating our systems. Just like a watchmaker adjusts a clock to keep time accurately, certain foods help regulate our bodies. Another essential role of food is to maintain balance within our bodies. Different foods provide various necessary substances, and to ensure we get them all, we need to eat a variety of foods. Mineral food, derived from the earth's crust, can be obtained by consuming water that has absorbed minerals, plants that have taken in minerals from the soil, or animal products that originated from plant-based foods. By exploring common foods, students can identify the essential food substances they contain, such as water, mineral matter, nitrogenous matter, and carbonaceous matter (sugar, starch, fat). For instance, in milk, the cream contains fat, while the liquid part mostly consists of water. Additionally, the white substance in milk, known as curd, contains sugar, highlighting the diverse nutritional components found in everyday foods.|['1.

Observe the pale greenish-yellow hue. Think back to seeing this color in water used to cook potatoes, cabbage, or other veggies. Explain to students that this tint comes from _mineral matter_ dissolved in the water. Next, let's investigate milk curds. Using our senses alone won't pinpoint the exact food substance in the curd. Teach students it's protein, deduced through reasoning. Babies thrive on milk alone for months, showing it contains all tissue-building elements. Milk must have mineral matter, protein, and water to build tissues. Since curd remains from milk, it's mostly protein. Analyzing milk unveils its nutritional value and that of its derivatives (like cream, cheese). Practice making dishes with milk as the main ingredient. Discuss egg preservation and the importance of not washing them unless necessary. Eggs should be stored in a clean, cool place to keep them fresh. Encourage reasoning over examining egg parts for food substance understanding. Boiling eggs for twenty minutes hardens the white but doesn't toughen the yolk. It's beneficial for students to have prior knowledge of plant structure for better comprehension of food preparation and value.|['1.

When we look at plants and their parts, we can see that they all share a similar structure. Just like how different parts of an animal's body have similarities, so do different parts of a plant. Plants are made up of many cells, much like a honeycomb. These cells vary in shape depending on the plant or the specific part of the plant. While most cells are too tiny to see without a microscope, some can be seen with the naked eye. For example, when you cut open an orange or lemon, you can see the cells. By grating a potato and straining it, you can separate the cell walls from the cell contents. The cell walls, mainly made of cellulose, have a fibrous texture and can be used to make things like thread and cloth. Cellulose also plays a role in digestion by aiding in filling the organs and relieving constipation. The cell contents, on the other hand, contain water, minerals, flavors, and starch. Starch is often stored in parts of plants like potatoes, acting as a reserve of energy.|['1.

"Plants are a vital source of starch used in manufacturing. In England, potatoes are commonly used, while in Canada, corn is prevalent. Early settlers used potatoes for laundry starch by grinding them. Starch is insoluble in cold liquids but dissolves with heat just below boiling point. This demonstrates that starch requires heat for dissolution, making raw starch indigestible. Seeds contain either starch or fat in abundance, not both. The root collects food, the stem transports it, and leaves act as lungs with little food but flavor. Fruits protect seeds and entice animals for seed dispersal. Seeds are the most nutritious part, often called ""nuggets of nourishment."" Dried foods retain nutrients and are cost-effective. Cooking in water allows substances to transfer, making the cooking water valuable for sauces or soups."|['1.

"In this cooking lesson, you will learn how to prepare vegetables and fruit properly. Start by washing the vegetables and cooking them until tender. Remember to save the vegetable water. For every 1/2 cup of vegetables, use 1/4 cup of the water to make a sauce. Reheat the vegetables in the sauce before serving. 

When preparing fruit, wash it well and soak it in cold water for twenty-four hours. Cook the fruit in the same water it soaked in, adding spices if desired. Simmer until tender, then add sugar and simmer for an additional ten minutes. 

As you study vegetable foods, you will practice preparing and cooking them regularly. Pay special attention to potatoes due to their high starch content. Additionally, learn how to use starch for thickening in sauces and soups. Remember that tomatoes are fruits and contain acid, which must be neutralized before adding milk.

After learning about the composition of animal and vegetable foods, students are now ready for basic lessons on diet. They should understand that a balanced meal provides the body with the correct proportions of each food substance. Children need simple, nutritious food rich in protein and minerals for growth and energy. As people age, their diet should remain simple but with less building material. Students can practice by creating menus for simple home meals as homework. Each student can prepare and serve a meal to the class, simulating a family setting. The teacher's role is to guide discussions and encourage students to take care of their own spaces. Regular cleaning routines can maintain a tidy home without the need for major cleanings. Weekly tasks like sweeping, dusting, and cleaning metals should be outlined for proper house upkeep.|"[""1.

Cleaning and caring for metal utensils is crucial to maintain their quality. Start by lifting small rugs and sweeping them outside if possible to air them out. For larger rugs, brush and fold them to sweep the underside and wipe the floor beneath. When cleaning utensils, be cautious of moisture as it can cause rust and make cleaning harder. Tinware, made of steel or iron coated with liquid tin, should be protected from scratches to prevent rust. Enamel or glaze-coated utensils should be handled carefully to avoid warping under high temperatures. To soften water for laundry, use borax, ammonia, washing soda, or lye. Understanding these cleaning methods is essential for maintaining cleanliness and preserving the quality of household items.|['1.

"Types of Laundry Alkalis:

When it comes to laundry, different alkalis serve various purposes. Borax is a gentle alkali that is great for colored clothes and woolens, keeping white clothes bright. Ammonia, while mild, can yellow white fabrics and should be used quickly due to its volatility. Washing soda, stronger than borax, must be diluted before use to prevent damage. Caustic soda or lye is potent and should be handled with care as it can dissolve fabrics. Soap, when mixed with water, emulsifies greasy stains, making them easier to remove. The right balance of alkali in soap determines its strength, with excess alkali creating a stronger soap. Additionally, harmless solvents like turpentine and washing powders can aid in cleaning clothes effectively."|['1.

To clean clothes effectively, start by wetting them and rubbing the soiled areas with soap. Roll each piece separately and pack them in a tub, placing the dirtiest items at the bottom. Cover the clothes with warm, soapy water and let them soak for at least an hour, or overnight if possible. Soaking helps to soften the fabric fibers, making it easier to remove foreign matter and dissolve soluble impurities. After soaking, wring out the clothes and place them in clean warm water or soapy suds. Rub the soiled parts on both sides using your knuckles, a washboard, or a washing machine. Once clean, wring out the excess water. Stains that are tough to remove may require special solvents that act on the specific type of foreign matter present. Students can share their experiences using special solvents for stain removal and compile a list. This activity helps them understand the importance of choosing the right solvent based on the stain's nature.|['1.

The lesson starts with the importance of preserving fruits when they are in season to use later. Bacteria cause food decay, but they differ from other plants as they don't need light. Bacteria need water, food, air, and heat to grow. To prevent bacterial growth, substances like salt, sugar, and vinegar are added. Canning is a common preservation method. In rural schools, students can practice canning by bringing their own jars and fruits. To can fruits, ensure jars are airtight, sterilize them, fill with prepared fruit, cover loosely, steam, fill with syrup, and seal. It's essential to follow these steps carefully to preserve food effectively.|['1.

In the lesson on canning, it is recommended to place a false bottom in the boiler to protect the jars. Fill the jars with fruit and syrup if desired, ensuring they do not touch. Add tepid water to the boiler, close to the jar tops, and gradually bring to a boil. Cook as directed. For jam and jelly making practice at home, discuss the theory in class. Start cooking practice with simple animal and vegetable foods like cream soups, custards, and shepherd's pie to engage students. In subsequent lessons, focus on flour mixtures. To understand white flour substances, mix bread flour with water, knead, wash to separate starch and gluten. Bake the gluten to demonstrate its properties. Gluten acts as the framework in mixtures, supporting the structure. Egg-white can also be used for this purpose.|['1.

In middle school, students learn about flour mixtures used in baking. They discover that to make a mixture light, its framework must increase in size. Heat can stiffen but not expand the framework; carbonic acid gas is needed for that. For example, soda and sour milk create this gas. Baking powder, a mix of soda and cream of tartar, is used for this purpose. It's important to keep baking powder dry with cornstarch. Cakes without butter, like sponge cake, use air and steam for lightness. Cakes with butter, like pound cake, also use carbonic acid gas. The process for making these cakes differs, involving steps like beating eggs and folding in flour. Students are encouraged to experiment with basic recipes and create variations by adding or substituting ingredients.|['1.

To start baking, mix 2 tablespoons of sugar with 1/2 cup of milk and an egg. Beat the egg until light, then combine it with the milk for the liquid. Shape the mixture into eight-inch round cakes and cut them into quarters. When introducing bread-making, explain the use of yeast to produce gas for the dough. Yeast is a one-celled plant that releases carbon dioxide gas. In contrast to quick breads made with baking powder, yeast bread requires time for the plants to produce gas. Yeast needs specific conditions to thrive, similar to bacteria. It is a microscopic plant that multiplies rapidly through budding. Yeast feeds on sugar or starch, like potato starch, and requires a warm environment to grow. Dry yeast is dried for long-term storage, while compressed yeast is moist and short-lived. To activate yeast, mix it with lukewarm water, sugar, and flour.|['1.

In the process of making bread, there are key steps to follow. First, mixing the ingredients is crucial as it helps blend everything together, incorporates air to aid the yeast, and makes the gluten elastic. Next comes baking, where the heat in the oven causes the dough to rise as air and gas expand, while water turns to steam, helping the dough rise further. The starch on the loaf's outside browns, and the inside starch becomes soluble. The gluten stiffens into the bread's shape, and the yeast is killed. For a class project, students can measure and mix ingredients, let the dough rise, and bake a small loaf of bread. Different bread mixtures can be made by adding extra ingredients like milk, eggs, or spices. It's essential to avoid anything that toughens the gluten for a light and easily crumbled bread.|"[""**1.

In the baking lesson, students discovered that kneading flour too much or adding too much water can make the mixture tough. Pastry needs some gluten to hold the ingredients together but too much makes it elastic. Using a small amount of water helps with this. Fat in butter cakes makes them tender, and the same principle applies to pastry. Mixing fat with flour helps break down the gluten's toughness. Air and steam are common lightening agents in pastry. Keeping the mixture cold is important as cold air expands more, making the pastry light. Puff pastry uses half as much fat as flour and folding techniques to create layers. Meat lessons are best saved for older students due to complexity and practicality. Preparation involves soaking bones and burning connective tissues to show bone structure. The lesson should include fat, bone, and muscle samples. Each lesson's length should match students' interest and ability, with a focus on hands-on activities.|['1.

When you strike a fresh bone with a steel knife, you can feel its hardness. Bones are made from food, specifically mineral matter, which is the hardest food substance. After burning a bone and removing all the mineral matter, what remains is the connective tissue. This tissue holds the bone together. Without the mineral matter, bones become fragile and can easily break. The connective tissue can be dissolved in hot water, leaving behind the mineral part of the bone. This mineral matter is crucial for building strong bones and teeth. It is essential for babies and young children to have this mineral in their diet to prevent bone deformities. Foods like milk and eggs contain this mineral in a form that the body can readily use. Additionally, examining the red part of meat reveals microscopic tubes holding a red juice that contains water, red color, flavor, muscle albumen, and mineral matter.|['1.

Gelatine is a type of protein that helps preserve the body's tissues rather than build them up. When making a plain jelly mixture, let it cool until creamy, then add whipped egg whites, fruit, or chopped veggies before letting it set. Frozen dishes like mousse can be made by beating thick cream with sugar and flavorings, placing it in a mold surrounded by ice and salt, and allowing it to set. For older students, planning and preparing meals can be a fun and educational activity. Students can create menus, shop for ingredients, cook, set the table, and serve the meal. This exercise helps students understand the importance of meal planning and preparation.|['1.

When preparing milk for infants, it is essential to use mixed milk from different cows for a better milk quality. The milk must be fresh and clean, ensuring cows, stables, utensils, and milkers' clothing are meticulously clean. If cleanliness is in doubt, pasteurization is recommended as it reduces bacterial life without altering the milk's composition. To pasteurize, fill sterilized bottles with milk, cork them with sterilized cotton, and heat in water to 155 degrees Fahrenheit. After cooling, store in a cool place for no more than two days. Utmost care should be taken when preparing the infant's food, sterilizing utensils each time. Bottles with rubber tubes should be avoided, opting for plain bottles with graduated markings and easily cleanable nipples. Bottles should be rinsed after use and sterilized by boiling for twenty minutes. Prepare enough food for twenty-four hours, store in bottles, and cool until needed. Warm the food slightly before feeding.|"['1.

"Health and Hygiene Tips for a Sickroom

When setting up a sickroom, it's important to choose furniture that can be easily cleaned. Opt for small rugs instead of carpets for easy removal and cleaning. During infectious diseases, keep only essential items in the room. Ensure there is a good flow of fresh air day and night by having two openings in the roomâ€”one to let in fresh air and the other to release stale air. Ideally, these openings should be on opposite sides of the room and at different heights. If there's only one window, make sure it can open at both the top and bottom. Additionally, keep the room clean and neat, with quiet cleaning methods to avoid disturbing the patient. Change linen daily or more frequently if needed, and pay extra attention to tucking in sheets properly to keep them smooth and wrinkle-free."|['1.
