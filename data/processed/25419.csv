Six individuals gathered around the dinner table in the living room at Pebbly Pit Ranch-house after their trip to file a claim on a gold mine in Oak Creek. Sary, the maid, had supper ready for the tired riders upon their return. While serving dessert, Sary went to help Jeb, the foreman, with the horses. The group felt free to chat, but Polly and Eleanor were exhausted, and Barbara hid a yawn. Anne, the teacher, wanted to plan for the mine's future, but needed rest after the excitement. Mr. Brewster explained the need to camouflage messages to avoid claim jumpers. They discussed protecting their rights and Old Montresor's family's rights. Plans were made with Simms and the sheriff's son to avoid trouble. Jeb was to be sent ahead to secure Rattle-Snake Mike as their guide. The group retired to rest before their early start.|"['1.

Mr. Brewster disagreed with the plan and suggested that Polly and Anne should take Jeb for an escort and head to the cave immediately. He advised them to let the horses lead the way and reach the cave quickly. He instructed them to hold the fort until he and the others joined them to confront the two mysterious men. Polly expressed concerns about a grizzly bear in the cave and the presence of three miners ahead who might pose a threat. Mr. Brewster decided that it would be safer for Polly and Anne to stay behind due to the lack of firearms. He assured them that once they reached a safe spot, Mike would return to guide the rest to them. As they set off, Mr. Brewster discreetly prepared his revolvers for any potential danger. Soon, two riders approached, and Mr. Brewster recognized one of them as Hank from the filing office in Oak Creek.

"Jeb finished speaking and patiently waited for John to stop laughing.

Beavers are fascinating creatures that work together to build dams. They plan to construct a new dam upstream, which will be exciting to watch. Currently, they are repairing old houses for winter and using a log as a base for weaving willow and aspen cuttings to create a strainer for the water. This method makes the dam strong yet flexible. When a new tree was moved into the water, four beavers sprang into action. They worked diligently, with one beaver leading the way and others following with tree sections. The boss beaver supervised the work and taught the others how to cut efficiently. The beavers are slow on land but excellent swimmers, ensuring their safety from predators. Their teamwork and ingenuity are essential for their survival in the wild.|"['1.

Grandfather Beaver, despite his physical challenges, led the other beavers in construction work with speed and precision. Sensing danger, he called for help and swam away, leaving commands with another beaver. Eleanor witnessed his return from the water, expressing joy upon seeing a friend.

While the father left, I stood back, observing eagerly as many beavers gathered around him, helping to push him onto the dam where he lay. We were anxious to know if our friend was recovering or had passed away. Father and I decided to investigate by creeping out onto the dam. When we made a peculiar sound, a beaver cautiously poked his nose out, then approached us making strange noises, indicating our friend's condition. Last spring, I visited the colony and found our friend, still in charge but with a crooked back from a lion attack.

The Courts have ruled in favor of Dr. Evans retaining the patent rights, allowing the company to proceed with their plans. If the company can find affordable materials for mining without excessive costs for equipment, they will establish a close corporation promptly. However, if mining the required stones demands substantial capital, the original members may need to sell half their rights to fund the project. Do you understand so far? When I first visited Pebbly Pit with John, I saw the vibrant stones at Rainbow Cliffs. Despite urging Mr. Brewster to send samples to my father for Dr. Evans' machine, my friend failed to grasp the opportunity. I informed my father about the unmined stones at Rainbow Cliffs, but progress halted due to an injunction. A surprising telegram from Oak Creek revealed Polly's claim to a gold mine, prompting us to rush there. To develop Choko's Find, substantial funding is crucial due to safety concerns and potential obstacles in mining. Polly and Eleanor may need to secure additional capital, potentially through stock sales or royalty agreements. Maintaining a controlling share in the company is advisable. Transporting ore from the mine to the railroad will require significant investment in infrastructure. Sam Brewster's company, with experience at Rainbow Cliffs, could provide capital for the venture. Collaboration between the Evans' Jewel Cutting Company and the Polly-Eleanor Company is envisioned for mutual benefit, with shared ownership ensuring fair dealings between the mines.|"['1.

A group of individuals, including Tom, John, and Polly, discussed plans to mine stones from Rainbow Cliffs and generate wealth. They proposed combining efforts with various companies to minimize costs and maximize profits. However, Polly expressed her desire to leave home for a higher education, which her father initially opposed due to concerns about machinery and miners disrupting their surroundings. Eventually, Polly's father agreed to support her education as long as she remained at home. Polly passionately voiced her need for self-expression and opportunities beyond the confines of her home. She yearned for the chance to explore the world, learn, and grow outside the limitations she felt at home. Her determination to seek education and independence resonated with her desire for personal growth and self-discovery.|"['1.

"Mother and father had traditional views about their children's futures. They believed that their son should attend college to build a career, while their daughter should stay home to learn domestic tasks. But Polly challenged these outdated notions, asserting that women deserve the same opportunities as men. She rejected the idea of being a mere housewife and advocated for women's independence and education.

Eleanor and Anne supported Polly's stance, emphasizing that girls have the right to pursue their dreams and not be confined to societal expectations. They believed in empowering women to find their own paths in life. Polly's mother also acknowledged the importance of letting children follow their aspirations rather than restricting them to traditional roles.

Jim mentioned that they were currently at Silver Creek with only a week left of work there before moving on to the next section near Buffalo Park. He also inquired about Old Montresor's cabin at that location. Jim then invited the girls to join them for a weekend at camp, where the Boss's wife, Mrs. Carew, would be the hostess. He explained that Mrs. Carew usually spends Sundays at camp unless the Boss visits her in town. They planned to wait for updates on the stones sent to New York and the financing of Choko's Find. John expressed his satisfaction at the prospect of his dad and Dr. Evans visiting. Anne smiled at John's excitement. Mrs. Brewster and Tom Latimer shared a knowing look. The group decided to ride up to Buffalo Park if Mrs. Carew visited her husband over the weekend and the weather allowed. After the boys returned to camp, Polly and Eleanor, limited in activities on Sunday, decided to visit the burros Noddy and Choko. They overheard a mysterious conversation behind the wagon-shed, prompting them to investigate from the loft window.

Both girls stifled their giggles as they watched Jeb express his love in a dramatic way, pretending to be heartbroken and torn by unrequited affection. They found his antics amusing, especially when he struggled with what to call the object of his affection. Despite the laughter, Jeb remained serious about his feelings. As he continued his declaration, the girls struggled to contain their amusement. Jeb's determination to win over his love interest was evident as he recited lines of devotion to himself while feeding the pigs. Later, Polly questioned John about Jeb's behavior, but John dismissed it as harmless. Meanwhile, Sary, the maid, revealed unexpected aspirations by sneaking off to a hidden hammock in her new outfit.

Snowball and Nigger disagreed, pulling in opposite directions around a tree, causing a jolt that nearly threw John off. After resolving the issue, they continued. Nigger then played tricks, tripping over stones to startle Snowball, disrupting John's conversation. Eventually, Nigger behaved, and they journeyed through forests and golden mesa.

Sary had a busy Saturday ahead with baking and preparing dinner for extra guests. She wanted Polly and Eleanor to help, but they were nowhere to be found. Mrs. Brewster saw this as an opportunity to suggest to Jeb that he accompany Sary to Denver to choose an engagement ring. With the house full of guests, it seemed impossible, but once the visitors left, there would be a chance for the trip. While Sary felt there was a hidden motive, she couldn't resist the idea of planning for her ring. Meanwhile, Polly and Eleanor climbed the cliffs to watch for the ranch-wagon. They spotted two horsemen riding towards Pebbly Pit but lost sight of them. When the riders reached a trail junction, they debated which path to take.

Poll and her friend hurried back to the ranch, eager to inform Poll's father about the urgent situation. They sprinted along the Rainbow Cliffs trail until they reached the point where they had called out to Jeb earlier. Pausing to catch their breath, they spotted Mr. Brewster leaving the house. Without wasting a moment, they shouted to get his attention. Mr. Brewster, alert to their calls, swiftly mounted his horse and rode towards them. After hearing their brief explanation, he quickly grasped the gravity of the situation. Instructing the girls to notify Mrs. Brewster and prepare for any emergencies, he galloped to the barn to gather help for the rescue mission. Meanwhile, Jeb, down at the shale-fields, carefully uncovered a trapped man, ensuring he could breathe.

Mr. Brewster instructed Jeb to secure the rope around himself safely before attempting to rescue the unconscious man. Jeb, with the rope secured, started digging to free the trapped man. However, the man's leg was firmly pinned by the fallen horse, requiring assistance. Another man was lowered to help. Carefully, they worked to extract the man, finding a leather bag on him. Once freed, the unconscious man was attended to by Mr. Brewster. Meanwhile, other men headed to the source of the washout caused by a flood. They located the second rider trapped among boulders.
