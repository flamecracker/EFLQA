A light lunch was quickly decided on. Dinah took Flossie and Nan to a small private room at one end of the train, while Bert went with his father to the smoking room at the other end. Each small sandwich was wrapped separately in waxed paper to avoid crumbs spilling. Meanwhile, Bert enjoyed his lunch at the other end as children always get hungry when traveling. Two girls in gingham aprons and paper caps darted into the compartment, but quickly left due to lack of space. Mrs. Bobbsey suggested resting with closed eyes until they reached Meadow Brook. Upon arrival, the family gathered their belongings, including the little black cat, and met Uncle Daniel. They arrived at the Bobbseys' country home to be greeted by Martha, the cheerful servant.

Tom then rode Sable, the pony, bareback, which led to a wild ride through a cornfield. The commotion attracted attention, and a neighbor demanded payment for the damages. Mr. Mason intervened, offering to repair any damage caused by the horse's run. Despite the mishap, the boys enjoyed a fishing trip the following day with Bert's new fishing line.|"['1.

"Bert caught a large salmon and a black-spotted lizard that had been washed out from a dark mountain spot. Harry discovered a toy canoe in the stream, probably left by a child before the flood. Jack collected various items that had broken loose from barns near the pond. Freddie, wearing boots, sailed his ""ark"" on the road, even trying to get the cat, Snoop, for a ride. As the water receded, wet patches remained, creating streams for Freddie's boat. The sun dried things up quickly, but hay and summer vegetables near the pond were ruined. The village of Meadow Brook returned to peace after the flood. The children then became interested in a fresh-air camp, where they met children from the city with poor clothes. They learned about the camp's purpose and activities, including a boys' brigade and bedtime bugle taps. They also met a small boy with blue eyes, who was cheerful despite his circumstances."|"['1.

"""I thought I should never see these again,"" said Nan. ""I must tell mamma of this!"" And she started for the house with flying feet. Mrs. Bobbsey was glad indeed to learn that the strings of pearls had been found, and everybody declared that Nan was certainly lucky.

""Not exactly,"" said the man, ""but there are lots of other things in the bottoms of wells. You must get your daddy to show you the sky through a fireplace, and you will then know how the stars look in daylight,"" he finished, saying goodbye to all and starting off for the big deep well-pump over in the picnic grove, that had not been cleaned since it had been dug there three years before.

""I hope you won't go very soon,"" replied Harry. ""We've arranged a lot of ball matches next month. We're going to play the school nine first, then we're to play the boys at Cedarhurst and a picked nine from South Meadow Brook.""

""Oh, Bert!"" called Nan, running out of the house. ""That was an invitation for us to go to Aunt Emily's at the seashore. And Cousin Dorothy says we will have such a lovely time! But I'm sure we could never have a better time than we had here, Harry,"" she added to her cousin.
