The young Doctor not only cleaned his glasses, he also raised his head proudly. Mrs. Millar read the letter repeatedly, cherishing it until it wore out. She kept the worn pieces and shared parts of it with select audiences. Each time she read it, she prayed for God's blessings on her daughter Annie and felt honored to have such a daughter. Dora and May couldn't stop talking about how Annie had helped the lad in his time of need. They spent every spare moment knitting socks and scarves for him. Their big project was a quilted dressing gown so he could feel like a prince during his recovery. Rose Millar decided to appreciate everything in her new home. Mrs. Jennings, her landlady, was a kind and respectable lady. Rose admired her orderly house and the respect she showed to everyone. Mrs. Jennings was tall, thin, and elegant, always appearing well put together. She wore a black lace shawl in summer and a white wool one in winter, adding to her dignified appearance. Rose found a friend in Hester Jennings, Mrs. Jennings's daughter, who was also an art student. Although Rose didn't connect with the other residents in the house, she appreciated the friendship of Hester.|"['1.

Hester Jennings, a young woman about Annie Millar's age, appeared older due to the premature toll of study and work. Unlike her mother, she possessed striking violet-blue eyes and a fair complexion. Hester's indifference to her appearance contrasted sharply with her artistic talents. While she excelled in creating harmonious portraits, she neglected her own attire, favoring bold colors and ill-fitting garments. Despite her unconventional style, Hester's dedication to her craft was unwavering. She worked tirelessly on various designs, aiming to provide art accessible to children and the masses.

Hester's honesty was sharpened by her circumstances, making her self-criticism even harsher than her critique of others. She advised Rose on her art, cautioning her not to share the work with anyone else. Hester's feedback was blunt, predicting Rose's return to basic techniques by her art teacher. Rose, defensive but determined, considered her past teachers' motives. Hester's advice was straightforward, highlighting Rose's need to focus and not rush her art. She encouraged Rose to relearn the basics and improve her skills gradually. Hester's ambition was to be a dedicated artist free from societal norms, aiming to live an artist's life in Paris.

Hester was not the sole child in her family. Mrs. Jennings had sons in the army and navy, but none were high-ranking enough to support their mother due to the competitive exams and high living costs. Despite being grown men, they had to rely on their mother for help. Hester was the only one working tirelessly to assist her mother, balancing her studies and rest time. The two women, though united by a strong bond, had different tastes and thoughts. Hester was a radical while her mother was conservative. Hester worked relentlessly for women's rights and art, despite being overworked. She influenced her sister Rose, who taught art classes. The art classes were filled with various pupils, each unique in their style and approach. Rose also worked as an assistant drawing-mistress at a boarding school, where the environment was more traditional and less progressive than she was accustomed to.|"[""1.

The school received abundant support and excelled in its endeavors. The elderly Misses Stone, with their gentle manners, created an atmosphere that appealed to conservative families. The school's focus on amiability and traditional values made it a safe haven for young girls. However, Rose, a drawing-mistress, felt suffocated by the strict rules and artificial system. The art subjects, filled with clichés and stereotypes, only added to her frustration. Rose longed for the freedom and creativity she experienced in Mr. St. Foy's classes. She felt constrained by the Misses Stone's rigid expectations and yearned for a break from the stifling propriety.

Rose found herself in a challenging situation. Despite feeling the sting of criticism from Hester Jennings, a knowledgeable figure in the art world, Rose maintained her composure. However, the absence of the principal drawing-mistress led to a moment of vulnerability for Rose. Overwhelmed by her emotions, she struggled to control her laughter during a drawing class, which was highly unusual in the strict environment of the Misses Stone's school. The unexpected display of emotion left Rose feeling embarrassed and exposed in front of her classmates.

Rose had behaved in a way that was not in line with the standards expected of her as an assistant drawing-mistress. She felt ashamed and sought advice from Miss Lucilla Stone. Miss Stone, composed and in control, advised Rose on the importance of self-control, especially when dealing with young people. She suggested using a sedative to help Rose maintain composure during drawing lessons. Though reluctant, Rose followed the advice and took the sedatives. Despite her inner resistance, she complied with the regimen, even though she found it distasteful. Rose's younger sister, Annie, did not come to her aid, seeing the situation as a joke.

May's heart was torn between her family and her desire to work in the shop. Despite her reluctance, she approached Tom Robinson for a job. However, Tom, understanding the situation, gently declined her offer, explaining that her talents were better suited elsewhere. May, puzzled, questioned why clever individuals couldn't work in shops.

May was hesitant as she spoke to Tom, trying to convince him to speak to her father. She suggested that if Tom explained how happy and dedicated she would be working in his shop alongside Phyllis Carey, it might change her father's mind.

Tom then expressed his enjoyment of working in the shop, finding pride in his accomplishments and helping others.
