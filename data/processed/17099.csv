"""We will reach our destination soon,"" the guardian assured. ""But I won't spoil the surprise. You'll see for yourselves when we arrive. Jane, slow down,"" she cautioned. Jane nodded, focused on the road ahead, with her companions alert for the upcoming turn. Passing two roads already, the third would lead them to Lonesome Cove.

The driver stopped and pressed the brake, but it was too late. The car continued forward, feeling like it was floating in thin air before plunging into the water with a big splash. Five girls and their guardian managed to escape the sinking car and swim to the surface. Thankfully, they all knew how to swim and held their breath instinctively. Jane had a bit of trouble getting out due to the steering wheel, but she remained calm and worked methodically to free herself. Once they were all safe on the surface, they realized they didn't know how they ended up in the water. Feeling the cold water, they aimed to reach the shore quickly.

"During their ongoing summer break, the Meadow-Brook Girls were invited by Jane McCarthy to explore the White Mountains, chronicled in ""THE MEADOW-BROOK GIRLS IN THE HILLS."" They encountered mishaps, attributing them to an unwelcoming guide, Janus Grubb. The mysterious disappearance of their guide led to unexpected events during their mountain expedition, making their journey a captivating read. Eager for new adventures, the girls were uncertain about reaching their next destination promptly. In the wee hours, the moon remained hidden, but the landscape became clearer when the clouds dispersed. They discovered a large body of water with an ice pier extending into it. While inspecting the water, they noticed their equipment floating. A playful suggestion to swim made Tommy hesitant, leading to a comical mishap that left everyone laughing."|"['1.

"Jane enthusiastically declared, ""I'll rescue you, dear!"" as she grabbed Tommy's hair, causing the little girl to scream louder. ""Help me, my friends! The dear one needs saving. We'll rescue her, right?"" Jane cheered. ""Absolutely,"" agreed Harriet. Leaning over the pier, Jane lifted Tommy above water, and Harriet grabbed her ankles. Instead of releasing Tommy's feet as planned, Jane accidentally let go of her shoulders, causing Tommy to land headfirst in the pond. Harriet struggled to get her out while Tommy cried. Miss Elting intervened, causing Tommy to fall back into the water. Eventually, they rescued Tommy, who was in tears. Hazel led her to shore, while the others waited for dawn to carry out their plan. As the first light appeared, Harriet, Jane, Hazel, and Miss Elting gathered equipment from the pond. Tommy, determined to show bravery, dared them to follow her and took a daring dive into the water. Grace, with her feet floating, humorously complained about standing in the water up to her neck."|"['1.

"Grace was eager to help but ended up sputtering and protesting when she went under the water. Tommy, instead of staying to mark the sunken car, quickly swam to shore. Meanwhile, Harriet, Hazel, and Jane were chatting with Miss Elting on the pier. Despite being wet, they didn't seem to mind. The sun was rising, promising to dry their clothes and warm them up after their ordeal the night before.""No, two of us would be in each other's way. You folks should stay here and wait. There will be plenty to do once I get the trunk ashore. We need to gather all our things before sunrise for the work ahead.

"""There she is!"" she cried; ""there she is! Right down there. Come in a hurry. She is under the car. I could see her plainly. Oh, I'm so scared!"" Tommy began paddling for the shore with all speed. Miss Elting did not answer. Instead, she took a long dive. About this time Jane came up. Hazel, who was making for the spot where the guardian had disappeared, pointed to it. Jane understood. It took her but a few seconds to reach the center of the rippling circle left by the guardian; then Crazy Jane's feet kicked the air a couple of times. She had taken an almost perpendicular dive. But it seemed that she had not been underwater more than a second or two when she lunged to the surface. A few feet from her Miss Elting appeared, threw herself over on her back and lay gasping for breath. Gazing out over the pond she saw Jane swimming swiftly toward shore, dragging the apparently lifeless body of Harriet Burrell. Miss Elting and Hazel were closing up on Jane rapidly. Reaching her side a moment later, the guardian took one of Harriet's arms and assisted in towing her in. Tommy remembered afterward having been fascinated by the expressions in their faces. She stared and stared. The faces of the two women were white and haggard. Still farther back she saw only Hazel's eyes. They were so large that Tommy was scarcely able to credit their belonging to"|"['1.

Hazel bravely swam out into the water and pushed the floating trunk towards the shore, following the guardian's instructions. As she opened the trunk with a stone, she understood the seriousness of the situation. Despite the uncertainty of Harriet's recovery, Hazel carefully laid out the contents of the trunk, ensuring Harriet's belongings were easily accessible. Meanwhile, Crazy Jane and Miss Elting worked tirelessly to revive Harriet, not giving up even as time passed. Tommy, usually nervous, helped by getting Harriet's clothing without hesitation.

Tommy neatly stacked the clothes nearby for easy access. The girls worked silently, noticing color returning to Harriet's cheeks.

"Margery turned away anxiously. By the time the guardian reached where Jane had placed Harriet, she had regained consciousness but was shivering with blue lips and a gray face, save for two faint spots of color.

With Jane's support, Harriet stood up, and they walked slowly. Gradually, color returned to her face. Miss Elting decided to find help for them and rushed off. She knew warm drinks were needed to help Harriet's circulation. Harriet tried walking without Jane's help, leaning on trees occasionally. Tommy chattered to distract her.

Harriet began describing how she unfastened all the straps on the buoyant trunk, which stood on end. She didn't realize the danger until the trunk hit her head. Afterward, she couldn't recall much until she felt someone helping her. The girls loaded their equipment onto a rickety wagon driven by a thin boy. Jane showed strength by assisting him. They decided to walk for exercise, leaving Harriet to ride briefly before joining them. The warm sun was a relief after the cold water incident.

Tommy and Harriet chuckled as they chatted lively, linking arms. Harriet seemed to gain strength as they walked, her step becoming more energetic and her face regaining its healthy color. The group, hungry from missing meals, hoped to reach their destination for lunch. When the boy finally pointed out Lonesome Cove and the nearby ocean, they began unloading their gear. Eager for a good meal at Wau-Wau, they split the packs to make them easier to carry. As they made their way down a path to the shore, the sound of the surf grew louder, exciting the girls. They reached a bluff overlooking the sparkling sea, feeling the spray on their faces and smelling the salt in the air.

The group of girls, led by their guardian, embarked on a journey. They carefully hid their supplies in a hidden spot among rocks, securing them with a mound of stones. After a brief rest near a farmhouse, they continued their trek. However, a delay occurred when Margery developed a blister on her foot.

A quarter-mile ahead, the girls noticed heavily wooded shores. Miss Elting was fixated on this spot, smiling to herself. Tommy stopped to help Margery keep up with the group. As they approached a miniature forest, they saw rows of tents and a flag fluttering in the center. Excited, they rushed into the camp where they were warmly welcomed by Mrs. Livingston, the Chief Guardian. The girls were surprised to find themselves at Camp Wau-Wau by the sea. Jane joked about the location being so remote that they might need to send letters to get another car.

Margery, who had been listening intently, now turned away haughtily, ignoring Tommy's comment. Harriet had gone to get the canvas for their makeshift bed. She planned to make leaf beds the next day if they found suitable branches. After cleaning the ground, they laid out the canvas, smoothed it, and beat out the dust. The girls settled on the canvas for the night, using their arms as pillows. Harriet watched the stars and listened to the waves. She noticed two lights on the sea, realizing they were from a boat approaching. As the boat drew closer, the lights disappeared. Harriet pondered showing a light but decided against it, knowing the boat could see their campfire. Eventually, she dozed off, only to wake later and find the lights had vanished.|"[""1.

Harriet was startled by the sight of a ship dangerously close to the shore without any lights. As she observed, the vessel maneuvered into a nearby bay, but she couldn't discern the exact activities on board. Despite the mysterious events, Harriet returned to her camp and fell asleep. Suddenly, a strong wind caused chaos, overturning tents and scattering belongings. Harriet and her friends were caught in the commotion as the wind wreaked havoc on their camp. Tents collapsed, cots were overturned, and the cook tent was left in disarray.

Harriet Burrell and Tommy found themselves in a challenging situation as they were swept out to sea by a receding wave. With determination, Harriet urged Tommy to swim towards what she believed was the shore, despite the darkness and the absence of a guiding light. The girls swam vigorously, staying close together to ensure their safety. However, as time passed, they realized that the shore was nowhere in sight, and the light Tommy had spotted had vanished. Harriet, realizing they were in deep waters, called out for help, but there was no response. In the cold, dark sea, Harriet advised Tommy to conserve her energy and wait for the night to lighten up before attempting to reach the shore. The girls faced challenges, but with Harriet's guidance and Tommy's trust, they hoped for a brighter outcome.|['1.

In the camp, there was intense excitement as Miss Elting witnessed Grace and Harriet vanish into the spray and water. Jane McCarthy rushed to the beach with others following, realizing the situation. A portion of the bluff had collapsed due to the strong waves. Miss Elting stopped Jane from leaping down, cautioning about the dangerous undertow. With no boat available and the stormy sea, they could only trust in hope. The Camp Girls gathered wood for a fire, but the rain had dampened everything, making it hard to start a fire.

As Harriet and Tommy made their way back from the shore, the ground beneath their feet felt firmer, confirming they were reaching dry land. Unlike the beach near their camp, the terrain sloped gently upwards towards the trees. Harriet, unsure of the camp's location, guessed it was to their right. She was correct but soon realized it was farther than expected. Exhausted, she helped Tommy up, but both collapsed, embracing each other in sleep. Meanwhile, Crazy Jane McCarthy, noting the wind's direction, decided to search the coast beyond where others had been.

There were tracks of heavy boots and marks where something heavy, possibly a box, had been placed. The men carried the box along the shore and into the woods. Tommy lost track of them in the dark. Harriet then confessed that she had seen two men with a box in a small boat near the bay the previous night. The mystery of the box, the boat, and the men deepened, leaving everyone puzzled."""|['1.

Harriet and her friends were on a camping trip when they stumbled upon some mysterious men near their cabin. Harriet, being resourceful, decided to follow the men to see what they were up to. She cleverly hid and observed them without being noticed. The men seemed to have some shady dealings, including leaving supplies for a friend on a fishing trip. Despite the girls' worn-out appearance from their adventure, Mrs. Livingston praised Harriet for her tracking skills. The men eventually left, and the group felt relieved that they would likely not be bothered again. Harriet shared her theory that the men had come to shore during a storm to drop something off and had returned later to finish their task. The Meadow-Brook Girls were commended for their bravery and quick thinking in this unusual situation.|"['1.

Mr. McCarthy, a respected figure among Portsmouth sailors, assured Mrs. Livingston of his concern for the safety of the women and girls at the camp. He mentioned relying on Lawyer Roberts's information about a skipper and offered his help if needed. As he prepared to leave, a passing moving van offered him a ride back to Portsmouth.

Late that afternoon, a shout arose as someone pointed up the coast. A tiny speck of white, about five miles away, revealed a sail. It seemed to be a single sail on a small boat. The sail appeared so white that they debated if it was their boat or a private yacht cruising down the coast. Harriet mentioned the boat was sailing faster than it seemed. As the sailboat approached, exclamations of admiration filled the air. With a single mast and a great spread of white canvas, the boat looked impressive with its two jibs pulling powerfully.

"The large sail on the ""Sister Sue"" came down noisily, and the anchor splashed into the water as the boat anchored in the bay. The skipper leisurely lit his pipe and sat down, puffing away. Meanwhile, the second man on the boat meticulously furled the sail before swabbing the decks and attending to other tasks. The girls on the shore watched, finding the activities trivial. When the supper horn sounded, the disappointed girls returned to camp. However, Harriet quickly went to check something and the others followed suit, racing to the landing place.

The captain of the sloop praised the girls' strength but was surprised by Harriet's quick actions when a sudden gust of wind hit the mainsail.

The girl pondered the space beneath the cabin floor, estimating a three-foot hull depth obscured by carpet. Unable to ascertain if the floor was easily removable, her findings seemed inconsequential. Tommy, displaying admirable behavior during the sail, proved discreet and sharp like Harriet. Despite saying little about the compass, Tommy remained alert. In the excitement of sailing, they forgot lunch. Captain Bill, preparing black coffee and bread, then pointed out the compass to Harriet. Explaining the thirty-two points, he emphasized the importance of learning them to become a sailor.

Captain Bill chose not to mention his time out on the boat, despite Harriet giving him a chance to do so that same day. The day was filled with a constant drizzle, but it didn't hinder the camp activities. The Camp Girls worked tirelessly regardless of the rain. Later that day, the Meadow-Brook Girls, along with their guardian, boarded the sloop. Harriet wanted to learn more about seamanship. She had already mastered the compass card and impressed the old skipper, but she aimed for more. Despite the continuous drizzle over the next few days, Harriet remained active, asking questions and learning about the ropes, stays, and compass. When the sun finally appeared on the fifth day, she used a sextant to calculate the latitude of the sloop, impressing everyone with her determination to learn.|[]|[]

"""We don't speak ships in the daylight,"" answered Tommy, drawing a quick glance from the captain.

Harriet Burrell focused on steering the boat, while her friends tried to signal the approaching cutter. The captain of the cutter managed to come close and spoke through a megaphone. Harriet suggested rescuing the other girls first, but the captain insisted on boarding their boat. After a risky transfer, everyone was safely on the revenue boat. The crew left three men on the sloop with a lifeboat in case of trouble. The revenue cutter towed the sloop back home, anchoring near Camp Wau-Wau. Due to high surf, they waited until morning to bring the girls ashore. The Meadow-Brook Girls' cabin was destroyed, revealing hidden ammunition.
