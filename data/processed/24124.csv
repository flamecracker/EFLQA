"""This ship scene is odd,"" said the head, annoyed, as people watched from land and other boats. Suddenly, a group on deck carrying sails tripped into a heap.

An officer's arrival interrupted the talk; Howe then moved among the discontented crew, guiding them on how to disrupt their duties. They were to create chaos by misunderstanding and bungling orders, concealing their involvement and spreading blame. The crew, upset they missed visiting Paris and Switzerland, were swayed by Howe, now seen as their leader. Sheffield, critical of Howe, suggested betraying him for spoiling their fun. Howe, frustrated, rejected conforming to authority and urged the crew to resist being left behind. He proposed causing trouble if not allowed ashore.

The troublemakers on the ship were unexpected, as they seemed like regular hardworking sailors. Howe, Wilton, Little, and others had secretly planned tricks to cause chaos among the crew. Captain Shuffles, feeling uneasy, was unaware of the mischief brewing. Mr. Lowington, below deck, believed in letting the new captain handle challenges independently. During a drill, a prank caused chaos, with seamen falling and confusion reigning. The crew, caught up in the mischief, made it difficult to identify the culprits. Shuffles and the commodore were puzzled by the situation. Despite the disruption, no serious injuries occurred, but the crew's behavior left everyone perplexed.|"['**1.

The crew was called to assemble, and the command to raise the anchor was repeated. The capstan bars were secured, and the midshipman made sure they were properly fixed before reporting to the second lieutenant. The officers were vigilant, ensuring the troublemakers wouldn't escape again. As the capstan was turned, a plank over the fore-hatch began to shift, unnoticed by the officers. Several sailors inadvertently kicked it, causing it to fall into the steerage below. Some crew members fell through, pretending to be injured. The mischievous boys were reprimanded, while the real culprits were identified. The officers intervened to stop the chaos. Despite the commotion, no one was seriously hurt.

Once more, the captain approached, consulting with Paul before returning to the quarter-deck without comment. The two mischievous crew members reported to the first lieutenant, escalating the issue to Captain Shuffles, who sent them to the principal. Ordered to await investigation in their mess-rooms, the hatchway closed, and the capstan was manned for the third time. Despite some seamen still affected, the anchor was successfully heaved. However, chaos ensued as only a portion of the sails dropped simultaneously. The crew's confusion was deliberate, with the intent to disrupt the operation. The midshipmen and masters struggled to untangle the mess, eventually resolving it. The crew's behavior verged on mutiny, with many involved in the orchestrated chaos. Paul suspected the culprits from the Josephine, singling out Howe for his role in the sabotage.|"['1.

Captain Shuffles called all the officers to the quarter-deck. He calmly addressed them, assigning specific tasks to each officer for setting the sails in a new order. Meanwhile, Howe and his group were pleased with their disruptive plans until they were caught in the act by vigilant officers. As the crew was ordered to set only the topsails, the inspectors aloft ensured the work was done correctly. The crew, motivated by the change in proceedings, quickly adapted to the new routine. Captain Shuffles, still unsatisfied, discussed with the principal about the need for more practice to improve ship discipline before going ashore again.

The plan is simple. If we split up, we'll be harder to catch. Let's go in small groups towards Germany, stepping out when we can. Two or three at a time is best. The Knights of the Red Cross, now the Golden Fleece, asked for money from their parents to be sent to Paris. Most parents complied, but some informed the principal.

The troublemakers on the ship quickly seized the opportunity to rile up the crew. They fueled the discontent among their fellow sailors, making them feel unfairly burdened by the new captain. While some suggested discussing the issue with the principal, others preferred a more rebellious approach.

As the students debated their next move, Raymond proposed a plan to defy orders after supper, refusing to weigh anchor. The crew was divided on whether to protest, refuse duty, or even mutiny. The tension rose as the crew awaited the call for supper, with many siding against the new captain.

He believed that the students had been misled into thinking the ship was heading to Belfast instead of the Rhine. Mr. Lowington emphasized the importance of handling the situation with understanding rather than harsh discipline. He encouraged everyone, including the officers, to remain calm and composed. The principal saw the incident as a learning opportunity and reminded the crew that maintaining composure was crucial in such circumstances. Ultimately, the ship was to set sail as planned, and the students were expected to return to their duties after clarifications were made.|"[""1.

The principal of the Academy Ship gathered the commodore and the captain in the main cabin to address the ongoing situation. He emphasized the importance of maintaining discipline and expressed his support for the captain. Despite the challenges faced, he encouraged the captain to persevere, highlighting the need to uphold the ship's operations. Plans were made to ensure the ship could sail with a reduced crew, and arrangements were put in place for additional support. The principal maintained a calm demeanor and engaged in conversation with others, giving no hint of the underlying tension.

The captain agreed with the idea and appointed Gordon as the second lieutenant to go to the Josephine on the second cutter. The boat was rowed by three masters and three midshipmen. Mr. Lowington, the principal, joined the boat to ensure the crew on the other ship was not affected by the mutiny. Haven, with a volunteer crew, left to get a tug-steamer. Meanwhile, Peaks, Bitts, Leach, and the head steward were on deck in case of any unexpected actions by the mutineers. Below deck, it was calm and better than the situation on deck. The rebels were waiting for an explanation of their behavior. They were unaware of the grating on the main hatch to prevent them from leaving. The principal intended to keep them waiting.|"['1.

As the ship set sail, the officers quickly organized the crew into two groups to handle tasks like raising and lowering sails. Thanks to the experienced sailors among the officers, the crew efficiently completed their duties. Everyone onboard was skilled at handling the ship, ensuring a smooth journey. The ship swiftly left the harbor, with the crew expertly setting the sails. Even though there had been some trouble with mutineers, the rest of the crew worked together harmoniously. The officers, midshipmen, and seamen collaborated effectively to navigate the ship. The ship headed northwest, smoothly sailing through the night. The captain addressed the crew, advising them to avoid the mutineers and maintain discipline. He clarified the ship's destination and assured the crew that the voyage to Germany was still on track.|['1.

Grace, standing with her mother near the mizzen-mast, interrupted Mr. Lowington's dismissal. She proposed decorating the young gentlemen with white ribbons of the Order of the Faithful. Mr. Lowington, amused by the idea, agreed, and the students cheered. Grace explained that she had bought ribbons in Paris for a dress, which inspired the idea of the Order. The students were initiated and decorated. Paul suggested Grace lead the Order, and a committee appointed her Grand Protectress. Grace accepted, adding humor to the occasion. The motto proposed by Haven was unanimously accepted. The students separated, feeling the mutiny was more like a fun event. Being decorated by Grace was a privilege they cherished, grateful they hadn't followed the steerage's misguided advice.|"['1.

The ship continued sailing smoothly, despite the worsening weather. At eight o'clock, the starboard watch, led by the first and third lieutenants, took over the deck while the port watch went below. All passengers were feeling well, and after supper, some students decided to challenge the ship's rules by gathering in the mess-rooms. Among them were forty-four individuals, including eighteen runaways turned seamen who were troublemakers. These troublemakers instigated others to rebel against the ship's authority. One student named Raymond led the group, aiming for a peaceful protest seeking explanation from the principal. They were not looking to cause chaos but wanted to express their dissatisfaction respectfully. The students felt they deserved the educational experiences promised, and if not heard, they would resort to informing their families about the situation.|"[""1.

Lindsley, Wilde, Raymond, and Willis were discussing their dissatisfaction with the principal aboard the Academy Ship. They believed that if they united and wrote home about their grievances, they could influence change. Raymond proposed that if they were treated better and allowed to explore the country, everyone would be content. Despite some reluctance from fellow students, Raymond and Lindsley planned to gather support by asking students to write to their parents about leaving the ship if conditions did not improve. However, not all students were on board with this plan. Raymond managed to gather only thirty names instead of the expected fifty. The rebels were divided, with some questioning the effectiveness and fairness of their approach.|"[""1.

Raymond, not content with the closed hatch, tried to laugh it off, saying they didn't need to go on deck anyway. Curious, he peered up and saw the boatswain keeping watch. The faithful had agreed to stay quiet, but the leader of the moderate group was upset. They couldn't sail with just twenty-eight, and the capstan needed thirty-two. The mutineers were anxious about the boat being lowered. As the faithful hoisted them back up, the rebels realized their plan was failing. Raymond predicted they weren't sailing to Belfast, just moving to another spot. The boatswain and carpenter opened the hatch, causing a stir among the mutineers. The rebels retreated as the two sailors only removed the ladder before returning it.|"['1.

They waited as the order to shake out the topsails was given. Looking up through the main skylight, they saw lieutenants, masters, and midshipmen on the yards. Paul Kendall, Gordon, and Haven were heard issuing orders usually given by lieutenants. They deduced that most officers were acting as seamen while past officers served as volunteers under the captain. The rebels were trying to figure a way out of the situation. The boatswain's whistle sounded, and all hands were called to muster. The rebels were puzzled by the activities on deck. The situation was unsatisfactory for the mild mutineers and not hopeful for the runaways. Raymond encouraged them to hold their ground as the ship headed northwest. Howe suggested a meeting aft the foremast to decide the next steps. Raymond cautioned against extreme measures, wanting to maintain control of the situation.|"['1.

Howe, a bold leader, urged his group to stand firm in their rebellion on the ship. He emphasized the need to make their presence felt and not back down despite feeling like the laughingstock of the ship. Raymond, cautious but intrigued, considered joining forces with Howe's intense party. They debated pledging support to Howe's plans but insisted on secrecy until they were sure of the intentions.

A group of passengers on the ship were tempted by curiosity to join a rebellion. Hyde and his group interrupted a discussion among the rebels. The rebels were divided into three parties, making unity difficult. Howe hoped to involve everyone in a daring plan. The rebels decided to play a prank on the principal by hiding in the hold. Little and Howe led the rebels into the hold, where they split into their respective groups. The hold was divided into storage areas. Howe's group focused on the water tanks, the ship's main water supply. Little warned the group to act quickly to avoid getting trapped. Despite the noise of the sea, they whispered to avoid detection. One rebel worried about the consequences of tampering with the water supply.|"[""1.

A group of rebels attempted a mischievous plan on the ship by emptying the water tanks to force the principal to return to port. Little devised this scheme, aiming to cause discomfort and suffering to those onboard. The rebels filled bottles with water from the tanks and intended to use them for their own group. However, they later abandoned the plan due to fear of being caught. As the rebels retreated, the faithful crew members, wearing white ribbons, remained quiet and did not engage with the rebels.

The group of listeners found the conversation amusing and followed Tremere's lead by staying silent about the events on deck. Despite the rebellion, everyone remained good-natured, except for the rebels themselves. Howe hinted at a possible commotion the next day. Raymond was vexed by his treatment but remained calm. Howe advised mocking the rebels, calling them the White Feathers. The cook struggled with a malfunctioning pump while trying to make coffee for the watch.

The ship's head steward was concerned about the water supply on board. He discovered that the water tanks had leaked into the well. After confirming this by tasting the water, he found the casks empty except for foul bilge water. With heavy weather approaching, the crew faced a water shortage. The principal decided to ration the remaining water and communicate with another ship for assistance. Mutiny among some crew members further complicated the situation. The principal organized the crew into different groups based on their loyalty, and some mutineers expressed regret and willingness to return to duty.

Mr. Lowington understood the runaways' plan to cause trouble and saw through the cunning schemes of the Howe party. He believed his strategy was working well by separating the innocent from the guilty. The mutineers were allowed to return to duty under the condition of no communication with the Howe or Raymond party. Grace Arbuckle awarded Hyde the blue ribbon for his loyalty. Tremere shared the secrets of the Order of the Faithful with Hyde. The ship headed towards the Josephine, signaling her to stop. The first cutter was sent to collect water, and the squadron continued its course. The rebels, unaware of the plan's success, hoped for a chance to strike out on their own.|"[""1.

When the water breakers arrived, the runaways felt dismayed. Tired and battling thoughts of repentance, they pressed on. Raymond's group, angered by Hyde's desertion, faced a bleak future but held onto pride. Anxious and weary, they retired as night fell. As the wind picked up, sails were reefed for safety. With heavy gusts and shifting winds, a dense fog enveloped the ship. In the morning, more reefs were added due to the thick fog. Despite the challenging weather, Captain Shuffles managed the ship skillfully. Breakfast was served in two shifts, with rebels excluded from the main tables.

Wilton, a rebel, was fearful of the boatswain due to a past incident involving a rebellious boy. The rebels reluctantly ate the salty, unappetizing food provided, feeling thirsty and desperate. Raymond sought water, finding none, and attempted to access it by any means necessary. The rebels, feeling uncomfortable and nervous from thirst, tried to stealthily obtain water, but were unsuccessful. At mealtime, they were served corned beef and hard bread without water, causing further discomfort. Raymond's desperate attempt to enter the kitchen led to his confinement by the boatswain. The ship sailed through fog, approaching the English coast. Meanwhile, the rebels, enduring misery and thirst, contemplated ways to secure water as they awaited a chance to join their shipmates on deck.|"['1.

Most of the crew on the ship were in high spirits, except for the rebels. The principal had clarified his rules, which left everyone content. Even in rough weather, the crew flawlessly executed their seamanship maneuvers, showing their skill and determination. Despite the choppy seas, passengers in the cabin, accustomed to sea travel, remained cheerful. The Grand Protectress closely followed the rebellion in steerage with interest. The crew, led by Lindsley and Raymond, were called on deck. Raymond, swayed by his friend's reasoning, decided to abandon the rebels' cause due to their selfish actions. The ship altered course towards Ushant, an island near France, as the wind shifted.

Paul led the Grand Protectress to the area where the head steward was providing the Raymond party with more water. The boys were very thirsty and had clearly suffered due to lack of water. Mr. Lowington had instructed that they should be given water frequently until they were satisfied as they had returned to their duties. It was believed that they had already been punished severely, not just by their thirst but also by the embarrassment of their failed plan. The principal intervened, stating that he wouldn't entertain their complaints and urged them to continue until they were content. The party, puzzled by the treatment, walked to the ship's weather-rail. The principal explained the badges worn by others, hinting at their secret meanings. Grace and Paul explained the initiation process and the motto of their group. Grace corrected Paul's slang, and they discussed the ship's course and the continuation of their journey. The conversation continued until the starboard watch was called for supper, and Raymond realized they had been fooled. The hungry delinquents were served supper, and those without ribbons were not allowed to eat. At six o'clock, the second supper was served, and the rest of the delinquents enjoyed the change in their meal.|"['1.

The group of runaways sat down for supper with only salt beef and hard bread, no tea or water. The food didn't please them, and they refused to eat it. They were extremely thirsty as they had already finished their water supply due to the salty breakfast. Despite being thirsty, they weren't in dire need yet. The unavailability of water made them crave it more. They couldn't eat the salt meat, finding it repulsive. The hard bread was dry and hard to eat. Feeling neglected and disregarded, they debated their situation. Howe, feeling the desperation, suggested taking action against hunger and thirst, even if it meant risking their lives. Little, usually resourceful, surprisingly advised surrendering rather than enduring further suffering. Howe, frustrated, expressed his desire to resist and not give in to their current plight.|['1.

If Howe could have made a sensation, he would have been better satisfied, even if he had been committed to the brig. He was vain and proud, and it hurt him more to be ignored than to be beaten. It was questionable whether he was desperate enough to put his savage threat into execution; but he collected a pile of books and papers in his mess-room, and declared his intention to Herman, Monroe, and others, who were his messmates.

Paul explained that the trouble on board was caused by a group of individuals who emptied the water tanks. Despite this, he believed that most of the crew members were led astray by these troublemakers. The rebels were given water and then ordered to set the sails, which they did with precision. However, they were left feeling defeated and isolated. The principal's method of dealing with the mutiny was successful, but the rebels were still unhappy. The rebels were fed sailors' fare and kept away from the rest of the crew. As the ship sailed towards Ushant, the rebels reflected on their actions and the consequences of their behavior. The rebels realized that their mutiny did not benefit them in any way.|"['1.

Glasses were needed as the officers spotted the sail ahead, confirming it was the consort ship. The vessel had veered farther from the coast than the Young America, taking a pilot near Ushant. Mr. Lowington was eager to connect with them after the mutiny. Passing through Goulet de Brest, a narrow entrance guarded by forts, the ships anchored near each other. The students were excited as they entered the bustling port of Brest. The disciplined crew impressed Captain Shuffles. The runaways, once skilled seamen, now behaved well. The experienced sailors shared their knowledge of the harbor. After securing the ship, the principal visited the Josephine, where the vice-principal reported on the mutineers' condition.

The plan involved creating diversions, manipulating situations, and securing funds for their journey. However, their discussion was interrupted by the boatswain's call for drills. The crew's performance was impressive, and they were soon piped to dinner. The crew eagerly awaited a lecture on Germany by Professor Mapps. Meanwhile, a ceremony onboard promoted members of an order, emphasizing the importance of loyalty and duty.

Peaks and Gage were moved to another ship temporarily, and Leach stayed to watch over the Young America. While the professor lectured in the steerage, Mr. Fluxion and officers returned to the other ship for supplies. The Josephine was readied for its trip without the students knowing. Some students found the lecture tedious, like Herman and Perth, who were unsure of the boatswain's loyalty. The faculty and students were uncertain about the boatswain's stance, causing a dilemma for the principal.

The swift change in the second teacher's notes is because the headmaster entered the steerage when the conversation between the two escapees paused. Perth and Herman were at the back of the group and under Mr. Lowington's watchful eye as he left the main cabin. Mr. Lowington might have found it odd for Perth and Herman to be taking notes so diligently, or he might have quickly grasped their activity. When the door opened, Herman sneakily stashed the sheet he was writing on into his pocket. Perth had written on one page and started on a second. He discreetly slid the first sheet into the atlas when his companion finished reading it. Mr. Lowington stopped near Gangway B. Perth folded the sheet to hide any objectionable content from the principal's view. Mr. Lowington wasn't entirely pleased with Perth's behavior and took the paper from the atlas. This action caused a stir among the boys. Mr. Mapps paused until the commotion settled. Mr. Lowington wasn't impressed with Perth's note-taking and suggested he sit closer to the professor. Perth moved as directed. Mr. Mapps resumed the lecture, but Perth was preoccupied with his predicament.

"Professor Mapps explains the pre-war Germany of 1866 and the subsequent rebuilding of North Germany. In ""Northern Lands, or Young America in Prussia and Russia,"" the current state of Germany will be discussed. The professor mentions that Germany is a union of states rather than a nation, with the Germanic Confederation serving specific purposes. In 1863, the confederation included thirty-four states with representatives meeting in Frankfort, the capital of Germany. The population of Northern Germany is approximately twenty-eight million, Southern Germany twelve and a half million, totaling about forty and a half million, similar to France. The ancient Romans had limited knowledge of the tribes north of the Danube and east of the Rhine, known as Germani, indicating their warlike nature. The history of Germany dates back to the reign of Charlemagne, where the empire was divided into three parts, with Germany under Louis.

Envious of the rising influence of the Hapsburgs, the nobles chose Adolph, Count of Nassau, as Emperor of Germany. However, Albert, Rudolph's son and successor, seized the crown from him. The Hapsburgs controlled territories in Switzerland, which they considered dependencies. The Swiss rebelled during Albert's rule, sparking a prolonged struggle for independence. During Sigismund's reign after Albert, John Huss, a reformer, was executed at Constance, leading to the Hussite war. Maximilian I followed in 1593, marking the start of the Reformation by Luther. Charles V, Maximilian's grandson, united Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, and Naples, making the empire a dominant force. Subsequent rulers faced challenges, leading to the Thirty Years' War and the eventual dissolution of the German empire. Prussia emerged as a significant power under Frederick the Great, countering Austria's influence. The French revolution and Napoleon's actions further weakened the empire until its formal dissolution in 1806. Germany's affairs were then managed by a confederation of states to ensure stability and prevent potential threats to Prussia.|"[""1.

Perth discreetly disposed of the incriminating paper he had written during the lecture by tearing it into small pieces and tossing it into the water. Peaks, a student, promptly informed the principal of Perth's actions, but the principal decided not to take immediate action. Perth, realizing he might be excluded from the upcoming excursion to the Rhine, stood quietly as Mr. Lowington, the principal, announced the details of the trip. The students erupted in applause upon hearing the itinerary, which included visits to Paris, Strasburg, and several other German cities along the Rhine. Despite wanting to grant a request, the principal was forced to leave thirty-one students on board the Josephine due to recent behavior issues. The runaways, unexpectedly, cheered at this decision, indicating they preferred staying behind. The principal, unfazed by the impudent applause, accepted the situation, likely content with an agreement he had made with Mr. Fluxion.|"['1.

During the Great Schism in the church, there was a dispute over who was the rightful Pope. Gregory offered to resign if Benedict did the same, but both refused. The Council of Pisa tried to resolve the issue by deposing both and electing Alexander V. However, this led to three popes claiming the chair. John XXIII called the Council of Constance, attended by bishops, cardinals, and ambassadors. John fled when asked to resign but was later persuaded to do so. Gregory willingly resigned, but Benedict remained defiant. The council deposed Benedict and elected Martin V. They also condemned the heresy of Wycliffe and burned his books. Huss and his disciple, Jerome of Prague, were condemned to the stake. The students explored historical sites in the town before embarking on a stormy journey to Friedrichshafen.|"[""1.

Despite the raging elements outside, they were warm and dry by the crackling fire. The young nobleman, Sir William, and Lady Feodora, the Earl of Blankville's daughter, were part of the group. Lady Feodora seemed more interested in the American sailor's bravery than in her betrothed, Sir William. The storm raged all night, but by morning, the sun shone brightly. Plans were made to return to Friedrichshafen, with Shuffles sailing the boat back with Lady Feodora, much to Sir William's dismay. The group finally arrived at their destination after a long journey.|"['1.

The group walked to the hotel where the American party was staying. As they neared the house, an older lady and gentleman hurried down from the porch, embracing Feodora with tears of joy. They were her parents, overjoyed at her safe return. Mr. Lowington and the young American party came out to greet Shuffles. They surprised him with three cheers, boosting his popularity. Mr. Lowington expressed his confidence in Shuffles, who had successfully saved both passengers. Lord Blankville's group, informed of the lecture, joined in. Lady Feodora, looking regal, received recognition from those who had seen her at the emperor's ball. The professor began a lecture on Würtemberg, a kingdom in the Germanic Confederation. The group then set off for an excursion to the Château, where Captain Shuffles and Lady Feodora enjoyed each other's company and the beauty of the royal summer residence.|"[""1.

The group returned to their hotel and decided to dine at the _table d'hôte_ with other guests, despite their usual aristocratic dining time of six o'clock. After dinner, they hurried to the train station and headed to Ulm. Dr. Winstock, Paul, and the Arbuckles found themselves in a train compartment with one less person as Captain Shuffles joined another group, much to Sir William's dismay. In Germany, the railway carriages have a luxurious first-class section with comfortable seats and a table, while the rest is for second-class passengers, similar to ordinary cars in the United States. Dr. Winstock shared information from a guidebook about the currency in Germany, enlightening the group about the various coins and their values. Upon arriving in Ulm, they caught a glimpse of the Danube before settling in for the night at Kronprinz Hôtel. The next day, they explored the city, learning about its linen industry and historical significance. They then continued their journey to Stuttgart, a city known for its vineyards and the grand palace of the king. The palace, with its numerous rooms and impressive artwork, left the group in awe. They also visited the king's stables and the public library, home to an extensive collection of books and manuscripts. The day concluded with visits to the museums of fine arts and natural history.|"[""1.

The group's next stop was Carlsruhe, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Baden. It was a short three-hour ride from Stuttgart, so they decided to leave at six in the evening to avoid arriving at noon the next day. Shuffles bid farewell to the earl's party at the Hôtel Marquardt, where Lady Feodora expressed her gratitude for his bravery. The earl and his lady showed genuine interest in Shuffles, hoping to meet him again. The following morning, the students explored the town's streets radiating from the king's palace. Professor Mapps described Karlsruhe as a pretty but quiet city with a modern history dating back to 1715. The group later arrived at Baden-Baden, nestled in a picturesque valley surrounded by the Black Forest hills. Known for its elegance, the town attracts visitors from across Europe, offering delightful walks and drives through the forested hills.|"[""1.

"On the hills above the town stand the old and new castles of the Grand Duke of Baden. The former, dating back to Roman times, was inhabited by dukes in the Middle Ages. The latter serves as the current sovereign's summer residence. Nestled at the base of the rocks beneath the modern castle are thirteen hot springs that gave rise to the town as a health retreat, known as ""Hell"" due to their high temperatures. These springs, with water as warm as 153-1/2° Fahrenheit, are piped to the village for baths and drinking. A temple-like structure covers the main spring, historically used by Romans for medicinal baths. The town's hub, the Conversationshaus, offers entertainment like dancing, dining, and gambling.

In a passageway, there used to be a deep hole covered by a trap door, but now it's boarded up. The tale goes that a person sentenced to a torturous punishment had to walk down this passage. At the end, they had to kiss an image of the Virgin Mary. As they did so, they unknowingly stepped on a trap that would send them falling onto a wheel studded with knives, tearing them apart. Legend has it that this gruesome pit was discovered when a dog fell through the floor, revealing the rusty wheel with bones and clothing remnants. However, visitors to such places should take these stories with a grain of salt. These underground rooms were likely used by secretive courts in the Middle Ages. The students explored the castle and enjoyed the gardens before heading to Heidelberg the next day.|['1.

The ocean was rough in the Bay of Biscay, and the ship Josephine, despite handling the weather well, was quite wet on the deck. The journey had been excellent so far. On the second day, Perth and Herman, while on duty below deck, discussed how long the voyage might last. The ship continued to sail away from Brest, and even if it turned back, it could take a few days to return to the port they had departed from. The situation was disheartening. The ship was far from land, sailing southwest. The officers remained quiet about the destination, causing uncertainty and worry among the crew. Despite the wind calming down a bit, the ship maintained a good speed. The crew spotted land after thirty hours, but the purpose of the voyage remained a mystery. The ship continued southward past Cape Ortegal, with the coast of Spain in view, and the crew remained puzzled about their destination.|"['1.

Perth and his fellow conspirators were determined to escape the ship's oppressive conditions. They devised a plan to take control of the vessel and head to Paris. Despite facing objections, the crew was eager to join the rebellion due to their dissatisfaction with Mr. Fluxion's leadership. Each member was assigned a specific task to ensure the success of their escape. However, as they approached land, the rough sea and swift current made it too dangerous to launch the boats. Perth decided to wait for a safer opportunity. The crew, though discontent, could not fully appreciate the majestic sight of the European and African mountains in the distance.

The vice-principal was well aware of the boys' intentions. He closely observed their conversations and warned the appointed leaders to stay alert. Despite the crew's desire to carry out their plans, no opportunity arose. The ship, Josephine, docked in Genoa after ten days, offering the boys a chance to explore, but they were too preoccupied with their grievances. The vice-principal supervised the painting of boats while the crew longed to go ashore. When the crew requested leave, they were denied due to boat maintenance.

They were all set for the plan Little had made, waiting for a chance to act. When the ship reached Cape Antonio, Perth announced the night was the time, despite the bright moonlight. Three knocks signaled the crew below, and a whistle alerted those above. Phillips, a big and ugly man, swiftly subdued Bitts with a rope. The crew readied the boats as chaos erupted in the cabin. Phillips secured Bitts and commanded the crew to row to shore. Once ashore, they were escorted to the Hôtel Prinz Karl in Heidelberg. Lady Feodora, looking slightly unwell, greeted Shuffles warmly, much to Sir William's displeasure.

Heidelberg is a charming town nestled between the River Neckar and a towering rock where the castle perches. The main street stretches nearly three miles and is home to about seventeen thousand residents. Surrounded by picturesque German landscapes, Heidelberg is a favored destination for travelers. The town once served as the capital of the Palatinate, a region established by Emperor Otto in the tenth century. The Palatines, sub-rulers, oversaw the emperor's interests. The town has a rich history, having endured multiple wars and attacks. Heidelberg boasts one of the oldest and most prestigious universities globally, founded in 1386. The university attracts students worldwide and offers exceptional programs in law and medicine. Despite its academic reputation, the university is also known for student duels that occur at a secluded hotel across the Neckar. These duels, often fought for club honor, are regulated and end within fifteen minutes to minimize injuries. The police attempt to monitor these events, but students are vigilant in evading detection.|"[""1.

In some clubs, the ability to drink a lot of beer is needed for entry, but this behavior is not common among students. After a lecture, a group went to Heidelberg Castle. The castle is known for its impressive ruins and vast grounds. The students explored the halls and vaults, reaching the famous _tun_, a massive wine barrel. They also visited the Königstuhl for a breathtaking view. The following day, they stayed in Heidelberg, attending church and visiting the Church of the Holy Ghost, shared by Catholics and Protestants. The group then traveled to Darmstadt, where Lady Feodora showed favoritism towards Shuffles, causing jealousy.

I stood near the table in a grand hall, watching a Russian win two hundred florins. I thought about betting two hundred florins but decided against it, so I lost out on the opportunity. Later, Shuffles and the earl's party gathered in a grand room, observing the lively scene. Lady Feodora didn't object as the commander headed to the gambling area. There, he found Sir William playing roulette, losing more often than winning. They all later joined a concert in the room. Sir William seemed cool but moody, making Shuffles uneasy about their upcoming private meeting. Shuffles noticed Lady Feodora's discomfort around Sir William and hoped to resolve any issues during their meeting. After the day's events, Shuffles and Sir William had a private talk in the garden. Sir William expressed gratitude for Shuffles' help on Lake Constance but also shared disappointment in Shuffles' behavior towards him and Lady Feodora.

By morning, Sir William seemed unchanged, likely deciding against any drastic actions. The group later returned to Frankfurt by train and chose to skip Wiesbaden for Mayence. Upon arrival, the students glimpsed a timber raft on the Rhine, a smaller version of what they had heard about. While most weren't keen on exploring Mayence, they visited key sites out of obligation. The professor shared the town's history, highlighting its role in printing and combating robber knights. The tourists then boarded a steamer for a Rhine journey, noting the contrast in steamers compared to those on the Hudson River.|"[""1.

The group enjoyed a meal on the boat before it set off, ensuring they didn't miss any sights. The dinner was tasty and affordable, typically costing seventeen silver groschen, around forty-one cents. However, if served on the deck to private groups, it would cost one thaler, equivalent to seventy-two cents. The boat made a stop at Biebrich, where passengers from Frankfurt, Homburg, and Wiesbaden usually board. As they continued, the passengers felt disappointed as they had never seen the river before. Dr. Winstock pointed out the famous Johannisberg château and vineyards, known for producing the renowned Johannisberger wine. The boat later stopped at Rüdesheim, famous for its wine, including the Rüdesheimer wine with a historical connection to Charlemagne. The group then reached Bingen on the Rhine, where the hills were utilized for vineyards, even on steep slopes. The doctor shared stories about the castles and landmarks along the river, such as the Castle of Ehrenfels and the Mouse Tower, recounting legends like 'The Tradition of Bishop Hatto' by Southey. The story told of the Archbishop of Mayence, who faced a grim fate due to his cruelty. The tale of poetic justice involving mice attacking the archbishop in the isolated tower was shared, highlighting the consequences of his actions.|['1.

"In the Middle Ages, the German word for mouse was ""maus,"" possibly derived from ""mauth."" The tower owners became unpopular for taxing river travelers. Brömser of Rüdesheim, a crusader, slayed a dragon in Palestine. Captured by the Saracens, he vowed his daughter to the church. Despite her betrothal, she obeyed, jumping into the river from the castle, now known as the Mouse Tower. The legend of Gisela's ghost persists. Paul noted the drastic actions of women in that era. Rheinstein Castle, now a Prussian prince's summer home, once levied tolls on Jews. Vineyards covered the rocky hillsides, tended by diligent peasants. Towns along the Rhine River are charming, with Stahlech Castle and St. Werner's Chapel ruins holding historical tales, like the dubious story of Werner's martyrdom."|"['1.

The _Pfalz_ and Caub town on the right were checkpoints where vessels paid a toll to navigate the river, a tax collected until a few years back by the Duke of Nassau. The toll-house was the _Pfalz_. In medieval times, there were thirty-two toll stations on the river. Schönberg Castle, on the left, got its name from the occupant with seven flirtatious daughters who were turned into rocks for rejecting suitors. Passing Oberwesel and the Seven Sisters, the river had whirlpools and rapids, now removed. The Lurlei precipice on the right has an echo that responds intelligently and sometimes mischievously. St. Goar and St. Goarhausen face each other, with Rheinfels Castle, the most extensive ruin, on the left bank. Boppart, an ancient Roman settlement, marks the widening of the river between the mountains. Marksburg Castle resembles one at Baden-Baden, offering eerie dungeons and galleries. The Rhine's passage through the mountains created the gorge. The Königstuhl was where emperors were elected and dethroned.|"['1. What was the toll-house known as in the medieval times?\nA.

Lahnech Castle is historically intriguing as it belonged to the Knights Templars, a group founded in 1118 to protect pilgrims and defend the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The Knights Templars were powerful but were eventually overthrown by the clergy. Stotzenfels, or Proud Rock, on the other side, holds the beautiful château of the King of Prussia. The town at the junction of the Moselle and Rhine rivers is fortified and intended to defend Prussia from French invaders. The Church of St. Castor is ancient, where Charlemagne's grandchildren once divided the empire. Napoleon erected a fountain there, commemorating his march to Russia, later ridiculed by a Russian commandant. The tourists explored the city's key sites, including the palace and Ehrenbreitstein fortress, capable of holding a large garrison. The fortress has extensive military structures, including bomb-proofs and cisterns for water supply. The students then continued their voyage down the Rhine, enjoying the scenic villages and occasional castles along the way.|"[""1.

"""At Brohl, a unique stone can be found that hardens underwater, making it ideal for cement,"" shared Dr. Winstock. ""Ancients used it for coffins due to its moisture-absorbing properties.

In the evening, the Hotel Royal bustled with activity. Some students strolled through Cologne's narrow streets, though not ideal for evening walks due to the lack of sidewalks and narrow roads. The Hotel Royal, with its spacious halls but no common area for guests like American hotels, housed Captain Shuffles and Lady Feodora promenading, while Paul and Grace chatted in the coffee-room. Feodora expressed gratitude for Paul's friendship and shared her father's kindness. Meanwhile, Sir William's smoking habit irked Lady Feodora. Ben Duncan introduced Sir William to Lord Elfinstone, leading to a pleasant evening for the young couple. The professor explained Cologne's history, from its Roman roots to its modern growth, highlighting its significance in Northern Europe's past.|"['1.

In Cologne, Germany, stands the immense _Domkirche_, a cathedral that rivals the grandeur of St. Peter's in Rome. This colossal church, started in 1248, is a masterpiece of Gothic architecture. It spans 511 feet in length and 231 feet in width, with a choir reaching 161 feet high. Two towers, if ever completed, will soar 500 feet above. After years of war and neglect, efforts to finish the cathedral resumed under King Frederick William of Prussia. The completion of this architectural wonder, estimated to cost five million dollars and requiring twenty more years of work, is now overseen by an association. Visitors are captivated by the cathedral's towering columns, arches, and vibrant stained-glass windows. Inside, the shrine of the Three Kings of Cologne, revered for centuries, holds a rich history and priceless treasures.|"[""1.

Near the shrine lies a slab in the pavement, housing the heart of Marie de Medicis, the wife of Henry IV of France. Her body was sent to France. The church boasts ancient and valuable paintings, some depicting the Magi. The tale of the Three Kings is a treasured tradition in this part of Europe, with hotels and public buildings named in their honor. The group circled the church to admire its grand exterior before purchasing views of the cathedral at a nearby bookstore. The party planned to visit a cologne shop opposite Jülich's Platz after exploring the Churches of St. Cunibert and St. Ursula. They marveled at the city's six to eight-hundred-year-old churches and the remarkable display at the Church of St. Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins.

The tourists departed from the inn and strolled to the cathedral, believed to be the oldest church in Germany. This chapel, named after the city, was designated by Charlemagne for his final resting place. It was sanctified by Pope Leo III alongside three hundred and sixty-five archbishops and bishops. Though partially devastated by invaders, Emperor Otho III reconstructed much of the original edifice. Beneath the dome's center lies a marble slab inscribed with CAROLO MAGNO, marking the site of Charlemagne's tomb. Discovered in 1165, his body was found seated on a throne, adorned in regal attire with a scepter and the Gospels. The cathedral houses numerous relics, including Charlemagne's skull and arm-bone, which was later discovered to be a leg-bone. Additionally, it holds significant artifacts like a lock of the Virgin's hair and the leathern girdle of Christ.|"[""1.

The farewell ceremony was emotional, with promises exchanged between Paul and Grace. After bidding goodbye, the students returned to Brest while the Arbuckles headed to London. The next morning, the students set sail for Lisbon, full of hope and excitement to reunite with loved ones. Despite a slower journey than expected, they arrived in the Tagus.

The sailors tried to follow the command and fend off their chasers. A quick scuffle broke out, with Perth and Phillips fighting fiercely. However, Peaks managed to board the gig, and the conflict ended. Peaks knocked Perth unconscious with a punch, while Phillips, bloodied, surrendered. The escapees were brought back to the ship and Perth was taken to his cabin by Peaks and treated by Dr. Carboy. Little's plan failed, and all were caught. The escapees looked at each other in surprise, realizing they hadn't improved their situation. They obeyed orders, fearing Peaks. The crew was mustered, searched, and Perth's money and valuable papers were confiscated. Mr. Fluxion held Cleats responsible, increasing vigilance to prevent future escapes. The escape leader admitted they were close to success but needed more time. The crew understood resisting the Academy's discipline was futile. The Josephine arrived in Lisbon after the Young America, greeted warmly while the escapees remained silent, acknowledging the consequences of their actions. Mr. Fluxion reported to the principal, and both agreed on the success of the squadron's discipline. Mr. Lowington was lenient with Cleats, placing him on probation.|"['1.

Before night, the original order on board both ships was restored, and once more the escapees mixed with the loyal ones. Each group had a tale to share, and the wonders of the stunning Rhine River were vividly described by the travelers. The recounting of the adventurers' escapades was envy-inducing to the others, who had little to speak of beyond their sea experiences, except for the Genoa harbor. It was regrettable to admit they had sailed the Mediterranean without stepping ashore. Those who adhered to their duties could truly appreciate the joys of their journey, especially after comparing it to that of the escapees. Only a handful of students disembarked, and those on duty; and at noon the day after the Josephine's arrival, the fleet set sail homeward. The usual ship routine resumed, blending classroom studies with ship duties. Following a single storm, both ships anchored in Brockway harbor after a month-long voyage. The runaways behaved reasonably well during the trip, learning that rebellion and disobedience led to neither safety nor satisfaction. While they were not entirely reformed, they were controlled and kept from a harmful life on land during the cruise. Some students, including Shuffles and Pelham, were redirected from their misguided paths, though their specific transformations were not detailed. The voyage had positive moral outcomes, with the ship's discipline curbing the boys' inclinations toward vice.
