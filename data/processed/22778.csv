Once upon a time, a little old woman found a silver penny while cleaning her house. Excited, she decided to buy a pig with it. At the market, she bought a pig but struggled to get it home. She asked a dog to help, but it refused. Then she tried a stick, fire, water, and even an ox to assist her, but none were willing. Frustrated, she asked a passing butcher to kill the ox, but he ignored her. As a last resort, she turned to a rat, pleading for help to hang the butcher. Unfortunately, the rat could not assist her either. In the end, the old woman was left to deal with her pig alone.|"['1.
