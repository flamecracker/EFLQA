The sturdy ship, the _Roving Bess_, sailed through the Pacific with pride, but a fierce gale surprised them. It began on a calm afternoon when flying fish darted from the sea to escape dolphins. The crew hurried to reduce sails as the storm approached. The captain, observing the falling barometer, warned of squalls.

The ship bravely faced the tempest, but disaster struck as the foremast broke, and the crew scrambled to clear the wreckage. Under the captain's orders, they scudded before the gale under bare poles. The crew, including the jovial Larry O'Neil and stern William Jones, steered through the raging storm. The captain feared they were near the coast and coral reefs, risking a capsize.

In the city, some people bet gold and silver coins, while others, just back from the mines, gambled with gold-dust and nuggets. These miners, with their rough appearance and weather-beaten faces, took risky chances. Some won big but lost it all in a few throws, leaving broke. A counter in the saloon offered plenty of drinks to fuel the gamblers' excitement. Ned, new to gambling, felt uneasy as he watched. A miner staked a large purse of gold-dust but lost and left angrily. Another gambler won at first but lost everything due to overconfidence. Ned noticed a familiar face, the young porter he once saw. The porter lost all, pulled a gun, and headed out. Ned followed, disarmed him, and offered a listening ear. The young man, Collins, shared his story of loss, sea adventures, success in the gold fields, and downfall due to gambling.|['1.

In God's guidance, Tom Collins chose to abstain from alcohol, avoiding the destructive path of gambling mixed with drinking. Despite his generous nature, his constant mental strain was weakening his health. At times, he had money to spare, which he shared with those in need or spent recklessly. Other times, he struggled to afford a meal, taking odd jobs to make ends meet. Offering his services as a porter at the quays, he met Ned Sinton and his friends. Ned, impressed by Tom's character, proposed they go to the gold-fields together. Although hesitant due to his financial situation, Tom agreed to meet Ned the next day to discuss further.

The Irishman, Larry O'Neil, swiftly carried a heavy trunk away, leaving Ned pondering the wild happenings in San Francisco during the gold rush. The chaotic society and bizarre events in California were beyond belief. Witnessing a man losing everything in a gambling house and meeting a tragic end was a stark example of the juxtaposition of the absurd and the dreadful. Ned, disturbed by the scene, sought solace by the bay. There, he found a man living in an old boat, gravely ill. Ned, moved by compassion, offered comfort and recited comforting words from Scripture to the dying man.

"After a brief pause, the man shared his story, ""I dedicated myself to my treasure. I worked tirelessly day and night, in all weather conditions. I sacrificed everything for it, spending all my time seeking it out. And I obtained it. But what use is it to me now? I have guarded it fiercely, threatening anyone who dared approach my gold."" Observing his visitor's curiosity, he challenged, ""You won't find it here. Search every nook, tear up every plank of my boat, all you'll find is rot and dust.""

In the vast plain on the road to the California gold mines, a group of weary travelers, including Captain Bunting, has paused under a solitary oak tree. The captain, perched on a mule, sports a battered wide-awake hat and a scarlet flannel shirt. His burly frame is clad in brown corduroys tucked into massive boots with Mexican spurs. A belt around his waist holds a bowie knife, pistols, a purse, and a bag. His rugged red beard is unkempt due to weeks without shaving. The group includes Ned Sinton, Tom Collins, Larry O'Neil, and Bill Jones, each with their own distinct attire. A native Californian vaquero, resembling a Spanish cowboy, accompanies them to assist with the pack mules.

Our group embarked on a boat journey of over a hundred miles, sailing across the vast San Francisco Bay and up the Sacramento River to reach Sacramento city. There, they acquired mules, supplies, and tools for their further trek of about a hundred and fifty miles to the gold mines in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Despite the steep prices, leaving them with only a few dollars, they were undeterred as they set out to seek their fortunes. Due to recent conflicts with local Indians, they invested in weapons for protection. Each man carried a rifle, pistol, and a blade. Ned, advised by Tom Collins, stocked up on medicines and art supplies to capture their journey.

Before nightfall, the travelers reached a roadside inn called a ranch, a new type of accommodation popping up for gold-hunters heading to the mines. Owned by a man named Dawson, who made money digging for gold and then opened a grog-shop and inn, realizing he could earn more by selling goods to miners than by digging. The ranch was a simple hut made of sun-dried bricks, focusing more on drinks than food. The place was basic with no furniture, guests sat on boxes, and casks. There were no beds; guests slept on the floor. The owner was rumored to be an escaped criminal but served the travelers' needs. The supper was meager but devoured quickly by hungry men. One hunter suggested sending a boy to hunt grizzly bears in the hills for better food.|['1.

"In surprise, the hunter exclaimed, ""Eaten! Of course they are. They're uncommonly good eating too, I guess. Many I've killed and eaten myself; and I prefer them to beef. I shot one in the hills two days ago and had supper from it, but in a hurry, I left the carcass to the coyotes."" The group around the table consisted of fifteen men, including adventurers from various nations like English, Irish, German, Yankee, and Chinese, most being gold-diggers. The prevailing good humor stemmed from their successful or hopeful endeavors in the mines.

Many tribes are peaceful, but some seek revenge for mistreatment, using only bows and arrows as weapons. A few brave white men with rifles can defend against many of them. Last winter on the Yuba River, large groups were nearby but did not attack openly, only targeting lone miners. The hunter shared a story of an encounter with a Native American and a miner. The Native American shot the miner with an arrow, but the hunter's rifle misfired. The miner died, and the hunter intervened to prevent a wrongful hanging of an innocent Native American.

"""I asked why they were hanging this old man,"" I said. They explained how the group sent to capture the murderer encountered a band of Native Americans ready to kill him for murdering a white man. They handed over an old Native American, claiming he was the killer. The diggers believed it and brought the old man back along with a few others. ""You seem to forget I witnessed the murder and reported it to you,"" I said. ""This is the man."" I tightened the noose around his neck, and in an instant, he was swinging from a tree branch. ""They deserved it,"" the tall man said. ""If it were up to me, I'd shoot them all."" Larry O'Neil, disapprovingly, mentioned the diggers were worse murderers than the Native Americans. The conversation shifted smoothly. The next stop was ten miles away, and they set off on horseback under the moonlight. The bill for supper surprised them, leaving only a dollar among them. Prices were high at the diggings, but most had gold. Captain Bunting and Bill Jones, amazed, left the ranche and rode off, entertained by the captain's mule antics.

In the sunny valley of Little Creek, a grizzled miner shared his experiences with a newcomer. The miner explained the nuances of mining for gold, emphasizing the profitability of steady work over fruitless prospecting. Despite occasional crimes, the valley enjoyed relative peace due to swift justice by the miners themselves. As they approached the settlement, the Scottish guide pointed out the picturesque landscape with glistening rocks, verdant hills, and the murmuring creek. The miners toiled diligently, their white tents and wooden shanties dotting the slopes. The scene was one of focused activity, with pick-axes and shovels rhythmically at work.

As the group approached the bustling hub of huts and tents, a sudden shift occurred. Noon had arrived, prompting the miners to drop their tools and head back towards the huts. Some sang loudly, while most were too tired for anything but food and rest. Noon was the customary dinner hour in the gold-mines, a practice that could be beneficial elsewhere. The travelers found the main log-cabin, acting as the colony's primary inn, abuzz with activity preparing for a quick yet hearty meal. Ned, short on funds, was offered credit by the innkeeper. They joined the miners for a meal at a long makeshift table, learning from their new friend McLeod. After a hurried dinner, most miners returned to work. Ned and his friends, guided by McLeod, headed to the river to learn about gold-digging and washing. They encountered a Yankee trying to sell his claim by deceptively showcasing gold in the dirt, a common trick at the mines to swindle newcomers. Maxton and Tom Collins saw through the ruse and exposed the scam, turning the tables on the Yankee.|['1.

In most gold diggings, miners learn through their own experiences, but sometimes they fall prey to deception. A poor Chilian was once tricked into paying a hefty sum for a claim that turned out to be nearly worthless. Despite his disappointment, he worked tirelessly and eventually struck a rich vein, earning forty dollars a day for two months. When the swindler tried to reclaim the claim through bullying, the miners stood up for justice, forcing the scoundrel to leave. Our adventurers spent the day observing gold extraction methods and selecting a site for their camp at Little Creek. They learned about panning and cradling techniques used to extract gold from the soil, with the cradle being more efficient for larger quantities. The team set up camp near the stream, ready to begin their own gold mining journey.|"['1.

"In just a short span of ten minutes, the top layer of soil was removed to expose the bluish-clay soil where gold was typically found. The pan was then filled with this ""pay-dirt,"" distinct from the ""surface-dirt"" that held no value, and taken to the stream for washing under McLeod's supervision. Despite Larry's initial clumsiness, he managed to extract a significant amount of precious material, much to the amazement of his companions. The discovery of gold sparked a mix of excitement, disbelief, and a hint of ridicule among the group.

"Ned Sinton enthusiastically declared that they would have supper. He urged Larry to settle their debt for dinner at the hotel. Bill Jones, who had been silent and astonished during the gold weighing, asked how much one hundred and eighty dollars was in pounds. McLeod explained it was about thirty-six pounds, leaving Bill wide-eyed. The miners began work early the next day. Ned and his friends dug for gold using pan-washing until they made some cash. They planned to construct rockers for more efficient gold washing. They dug the surface soil to find the ""pay-dirt,"" washed it, and saved the gold.

"""Quiet, everyone,"" Larry announced, raising his hand. ""We've just found the bullet. It's a bit flattened, but the size is clear. There's a wound by the heart, too, from a knife; that's what I want to figure out, but I don't want to use my own knife to cut into it."" A good idea came up. After a brief search, they found the murdered man's rusty knife. Larry used it to extract a piece of steel from the wound near the heart, likely broken from the knife used to kill him. Larry held it up triumphantly. The miners then headed to the main hotel where they found Black Jim, also known as Smith, in the gambling area. Larry went straight to him and accused him of murder, calling for a trial. The scene turned chaotic, with Smith trying to fight back until Ned Sinton intervened. The miners dragged Black Jim outside to a tree with a history of hangings for criminals. A fire was lit, and the miners demanded justice. Evidence was presented, including the bullet and a piece of steel from the victim's wound, matching Black Jim's knife. Despite protests of innocence, the miners were convinced of his guilt. Black Jim made a final plea, criticizing the miners for taking justice into their own hands. Larry then showed the damning evidence, proving Black Jim's guilt.

In the gold rush days of California, amid the rush for riches, Ned Sinton and his friends found solace in the Sabbath. Resting from their labor, they realized the importance of physical and spiritual rejuvenation. Ned proposed reading the Bible together on Sundays, seeking more than just physical rest. Tom initially opposed, fearing hypocrisy, but Ned emphasized the genuine desire for spiritual growth. Eventually, the group embraced the idea, finding peace and happiness in the shared readings. As they spent Sundays reading the Word of God, their hearts were touched, and they found a deeper sense of contentment.

Larry O'Neil wandered among the huts and tents of the miners, observing the village's contrast on week-days and Sundays. While quiet on weekdays, Sundays were filled with miners from all around, indulging in gambling and drinking. The gambling-houses attracted men who often returned week after week, losing their hard-earned money. Larry peered into one of the gambling-houses, witnessing the intense play and drunken excitement. Seeking solace, he ventured into the valley's deep solitude, away from the chaotic village. There, he stumbled upon a solitary tent where a pale, emaciated woman read to a sick man.

Our parents were Irish and moved to America. Although we've never set foot in Ireland, my brother and I feel a strong connection to it. Growing up secluded in the woods with only our parents around, we've adopted the Irish way of speaking. Larry, upon discovering that we were not entirely Irish, realized that our roots define us more than our birthplace. Our parents passed away, and my brother sold our farm to seek his fortune in the California gold mines. The journey was treacherous, with many perishing along the way due to harsh conditions.

Larry, a kind Irishman, comforted the sick brother of Kate, promising to fetch medicine and a doctor. He tasted the rancid soup Kate offered and spat it out. Despite Kate's lack of resources and gold, Larry raced to the store and returned with supplies, including brandy.

The man who could dive well was recognized by Ned, who knew him from the village. The diver indicated that there was gold at the bottom of the stream but couldn't retrieve it all. Ned returned to the tent excited to share his idea of diverting the stream to access the gold. Ned found Maxton cooking and shared his plan. Maxton revealed that the idea had been successful elsewhere but required teamwork. The miners, fueled by Ned's plan and a hearty meal, decided to visit Ah-wow, a Chinaman who knew a better spot for their operation. Ah-wow, with his unique appearance, led them to a spot near the stream where another Chinaman named Ko-sing joined them. The miners were eager to begin their new venture.|"['1.

The Chinese man smiled broadly and offered to shake hands, which Ned and the whole group accepted, settling the deal to everyone's satisfaction. Afterward, they inspected the stream bed and decided on a starting point for their work. As the sun began to set, they planned to return for their tent and mining tools, aiming to move quietly under the moonlight to avoid nosy neighbors. Most of their horses and mules had been sold to a Yankee heading back to Sacramento, leaving only Ned's horse. Before heading back, Bill Jones, always full of surprise since arriving in California, approached Ah-wow inquisitively. Bill touched Ah-wow's shoulder and asked about his long hair, mistaking it for grease. With a playful farewell to Ah-wow, Larry rejoined his friends as they walked towards the Little Creek diggings. The region was secluded and believed to have little gold, but the group discovered a rich ravine promising success. Despite six days of hard work without finding gold, they remained determined, knowing their efforts would pay off soon. The group toiled, some in the water while others built a dam to divert the stream.

The group successfully uncovered eight yards of the old stream bed, draining the water and revealing a rich deposit of gold nuggets. The following days were consumed with digging and finding more gold. Despite the excitement, they rested on the Sabbath, except for the Chinamen who were indifferent. Ned, influenced by his early training, resisted the temptation to work on the Sabbath. Their rest allowed them to work more efficiently, leading to a significant increase in their profits. However, their newfound wealth attracted unwanted attention, as a Yankee miner and his friends arrived to stake their claim nearby.

As the captain and his companion were faced with a grizzly bear, a third party suddenly appeared, causing a tense situation. The bear, with a ferocious look, stood in their path, leaving them with no choice but to defend themselves. They fired at the bear, but their efforts seemed futile, and they had to flee for their lives. Black Jim managed to escape, leaving the captain alone with the bear. The captain tried to climb a tree to evade the bear, but he fell and found himself unarmed. As night fell, the captain and the bear stared at each other, with the captain struggling to stay awake.

During dinner, Ned and his friends joked about the captain's hunting expedition. As night fell, they grew concerned when the captain didn't return. Ned decided to search for him. Leaving Maxton to guard their camp, the rest armed themselves and followed Ned. They found clues that the captain had gone up a ravine. Using a torch, they continued their search.

Bill Jones's saying is indeed wise. The bear was unharmed by the party, but Black Jim's shot brought it down. Despite being hastily aimed, the bullet struck the bear's heart, leaving it lifeless at the oak-tree's base. Ah-wow sat on a stump, looking distressed as he faced hanging for a crime he didn't commit. The jury, judge, and crowd believed him guilty of stealing gold, but Maxton and Captain Bunting doubted his guilt. Just as Ah-wow was about to face his fate, Ned Sinton and Larry O'Neil arrived to reveal the true thief, Black Jim. Ned's evidence cleared Ah-wow, who narrowly escaped a wrongful execution.

"Change is a natural law that affects everything around us. People, places, circumstances - they all change over time. Just like time moves forward, change is inevitable. Moving on to a new scene, let's journey deeper into the plains and mountains of the far west.

Picture a beautiful July evening after a refreshing shower. The landscape is lush and green, with diamond-drops glistening on leaves and blades. A wide valley stretches out, surrounded by blue mountain ranges. Giant trees like pines and cedars tower over the scenery, while oaks and mansanita shrubs add to the beauty. The golden haze and sweet scents in the air make it feel like Eden, untouched by man's hand.

Ned admitted he hadn't solved the problem yet, but argued that the unhealthy city air compared to the countryside proves cities are detrimental to health. He questioned why city dwellers always return healthier from the country. Ned believed city builders knowingly harm their health. Tom responded, calling all men geese for not listening to reason. They then encountered a digger Indian, resembling a monkey with odd attire. The tribe lived in dirty tents, mainly unclothed, with a few wearing mismatched European clothes. The men had long hair except for a square cut above the eyebrows. The children were naked, carried in cradles like North American Indians.

It is challenging to hold back laughter when a person stands before you in a comically scanty outfit, making strange faces and odd movements in an attempt to communicate with someone who doesn't speak their language. Ned found himself in this situation with the tribe's chief, an elderly man with a sparse beard, dressed in a worn blue coat typically seen on poor Irish laborers. The chief, through gestures, seemed to be indicating the mountains, wanting the travelers to stay. Despite his hospitality, Ned and Tom declined to continue their journey. Inside the chief's hut, they observed the squaw boiling water in a unique basket. Tom accepted soup, while Ned politely declined, opting for a smoke instead.

"For almost an hour, they moved forward without speaking or stopping. As they turned around a sharp rock, they nearly collided with a group of horsemen riding towards them. Both sides paused, ready with their weapons, sizing each other up in surprise at the sudden encounter.

""I won't follow your command until I know why,"" responded Ned, a bit irritated by the other's tone. ""We are peaceful travelers, not looking for trouble. But even if we were, your large group shouldn't be afraid. We won't run away, nor do we want to block your path.""

""We're not scared, young man,"" the leader spoke, eyeing them closely. ""Where are you from, and why are your clothes torn and faces bloodied?""

The horsemen closed in, surrounding the two friends, but Ned, unfazed, sensed they were trustworthy. Another man from the group spoke up, accusing them of knowing about a group of troublemakers in the area.

The conversation ended abruptly as hooves approached, and a rider sped by, firing a shot at the group before disappearing. Ned's calm demeanor and leadership qualities shone through as he directed the group to dismount and follow him on foot towards the site of a battle.

Despite Ned's attempt to lighten the mood, both were far from laughing. As they prepared to camp, a sudden accident with a falling oak branch led them to reconsider their camping spot. Eventually, they settled by a pine tree, enjoying a simple meal by the campfire. The night brought deep slumber, easing their troubles momentarily.

Before he could finish, the rope tightened, and Ned left with his friend as the robbers met their fate. In need of funds, Ned and Tom sold a horse and enjoyed a supper. They explored the settlement, where miners toiled for meager returns. Despite their hardships, Ned admired the natural beauty around them, capturing it in a sketch that caught the attention of a curious Yankee digger.

Tom Collins went out searching for gold and quickly found a spot that made him $20 a day. In a fortnight, they were quite wealthy. Ned, while preparing to draw, told Tom he wanted to travel again.

At this stage, Larry paused to admire his work, then quickly entered the tent and emerged with two tin canisters of pepper and salt. He seasoned the venison-dumpling and cooked it on hot stones. Despite the rain pouring like a cataract, work was halted, and men endured the muddy conditions. Some miners suffered from diseases due to the harsh environment, while doctors failed to provide effective treatments. With scarce provisions and high prices, fresh vegetables were a luxury. The valley turned into a hospital, and the stream banks became a burial ground. The miners faced challenges during the rainy season in California's gold regions.|"['1.

During a challenging time in a valley, a dying man lay in a hut where his sister, Kate, tried to comfort him with words from the Bible. Just then, a stranger on horseback entered and offered the sick man water. The stranger then read comforting passages from the Bible, bringing solace to the dying man. The stranger left after a brief prayer, leaving a sense of hope behind. Later, Ned Sinton arrived, reuniting with his friends Larry O'Neil and Captain Bunting.

Ned and Larry were puzzled by a mysterious letter mentioning unexpected news. Larry jokingly suggested they might have been appointed to important roles in the new government for their talents. They had sold their claims and tools for a good sum and were ready to move out, but Ned's sudden arrival delayed their departure. Larry shared their success in finding gold in the mines, although he found the place unhealthy. Larry rushed to a hut where he expected to find friends, but it was empty.

The trip to Sacramento was challenging due to the flooded landscape, taking the group days of hard riding to reach the city. Larry kept watch for Kate Morgan and the cart but didn't spot them. Each day he hoped to catch up, only to be disappointed each night. Upon arrival, Larry learned that Kate had arrived earlier with a knowledgeable guide, while Ned had taken a detour. Unaware of this, Larry considered returning but decided to stay and inquire. The trio headed to the City Hotel to ask about Tom Collins. While discussing, Captain Bunting whistled in surprise. Larry rushed in, exclaiming they were gone. Amid laughter, they agreed to follow the captain's lead. Unable to find another steamer to San Francisco for a week, they decided to enjoy Sacramento and look for their friend Bill Jones. Gold can achieve much materially, but it cannot buy youth or time. In California, the discovery of gold led to rapid growth, exemplified by Sacramento, a city that transformed almost overnight due to the gold rush.|"['1.

During the gold rush, the landowners in Sacramento were making huge profits. Plots of land were selling for thousands of dollars, and rents were exorbitant. Hotels were paying tens of thousands of dollars annually, and small stores were earning significant amounts. Even basic necessities were sold at high prices due to the demand. Despite the city's unhealthy conditions, the commercial success continued. The first hotel opening was celebrated lavishly with free feasts and drinks for everyone.

That evening, three friends sat in the back seat of a concert room, eagerly waiting for the show to start. The room was packed with people, mostly men, as women were rare attendees. The room was plain but well-lit with a large chandelier. At one end was a stage with chairs and instruments. While two friends observed the crowd, Larry overheard a miner and a sailor sharing a tale about a little girl and a wild horse. The sailor recounted his adventure catching the horse with the Mexican man. Just as the sailor was about to continue his story, the music began, and the sailor had to pause. The performance that followed was not the best, but it entertained the audience for a while.|"['Question 1:\nWhat were the three friends doing in the concert room?\nA) Playing instruments\nB) Observing the crowd\nC) Dancing on stage\nD) Talking to the sailor\nE) Eating snacks', 'Question 2:\nWho overheard the tale about the little girl and the wild horse?\nA) Larry\nB) The miner\nC) The Mexican man\nD) The sailor\nE) One of the two friends', 'Question 3:\nWhat was the room packed with?\nA) Children\nB) Women\nC) Men\nD) Musicians\nE) Animals', 'Question 4:\nWhat did the sailor and the miner share a tale about?\nA) A lost treasure\nB) A haunted house\nC) A little girl and a wild horse\nD) A sunken ship\nE) A magical potion', ""Question 5:\nWhat interrupted the sailor's storytelling?\nA) A loud noise\nB) The music starting\nC) A power outage\nD) Larry's question\nE) The room becoming silent"", 'Question 6:\nHow was the performance described?\nA) Boring\nB) Captivating\nC) Educational\nD) Short\nE) Unusual']"|['B) Observing the crowd', 'A) Larry', 'C) Men', 'C) A little girl and a wild horse', 'B) The music starting', 'B) Captivating']
"The man explained to the sailor and Larry about a tragic incident involving a Mexican rider and a wild horse. The horse made a final leap, causing the rider to fall forward and die instantly. The man suspected foul play as the deceased rider's daughter cried inconsolably. Despite offering help, the man was dismissed by a Yankee claiming to be a relative. Larry was captivated by the story and wanted to learn more. However, the performance of three minstrels interrupted further conversation. The sailors cheered for the minstrels as they sang popular tunes, captivating the audience. The highlight of the evening was a young girl named Mademoiselle Nelina, whose angelic appearance and sweet voice mesmerized everyone present.

Ned and the captain were initially unsure if Larry could identify someone he had never met. However, Larry's strong belief in recognizing the girl convinced them he was right. They whispered eagerly about how to contact the child. Ned suggested the girl might not like the strangers' questions and prefer to stay with her current guardian. Larry assured them the girl would trust him, mentioning he knew her sister Kate and could take her to her. Larry then sneaked behind the scenes while the show continued. He found the curtain separating the public from the orchestra and quietly entered. To his surprise, he faced Mademoiselle Nelina and a stern man, Bill Jones, who recognized him.

Larry was taken aback by the unexpected revelation at the City Hotel. Bill's dramatic entrance and subsequent door slam left Larry bewildered, unsure if Bill was mad, drunk, or both. As Bill unraveled the mystery of Mademoiselle Nelina and Larry's whereabouts, Larry's face contorted in a mix of emotions. Larry's mind raced as he realized Bill's knowledge and the impending confrontation after the concert. Larry's thigh slaps nearly drew unwanted attention, and his whistles called stray dogs. Eventually, Larry regained composure, paid the necessary fee, and learned about Nelly Morgan.

Larry felt disappointed at the outcome but consoled himself by planning to take matters into his own hands. With Bill's help, Larry arranged for Nelly to be informed about her sister's whereabouts.

Edward Sinton had astounded Mr. Moxton with a suggestion that seemed as outlandish as renting an office on the moon. The lawyer, taken aback, advised Ned to be cautious with the valuable papers and bid him good morning. Ned left, feeling the clerk's laughter linger in the office.
