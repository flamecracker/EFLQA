The Hare is a timid animal that runs away at the slightest sound. Despite being swift, Hares often fall prey to dogs. They are challenging to tame, unlike the Goat, a valuable domestic animal. Goats enjoy climbing rocks, and their milk is sweet and nourishing. Cows are essential for milk, butter, and cheese production. They have calves, and their age can be determined by the rings on their horns. Sheep provide meat, wool, and skin for clothing. Sheep-washing and shearing are busy times for farmers. Dormice are nocturnal creatures that live in comfortable nests. Donkeys are often mistreated, despite being patient and willing animals. Asses provide highly valued milk for the sick. Foals of Asses are lively and playful.|"['1. What animal is described as swift but easily falling prey to dogs?\nA) Goat\nB) Cow\nC) Sheep\nD) Hare\nE) Donkey', '2.
