Dedications have fallen out of fashion, except with the traditionalists. The old custom of appealing to a patron has disappeared from modern literature. Nowadays, when an author dedicates a book to someone, it's usually to honor beloved friends. Such dedications carry a sense of assurance, assuming that the recipient gains honor from the association with the book. In this case, the author dedicates the book to a bank, a dear friend that has supported them through thick and thin. The story ends with the Battle of Waterloo, a battle often seen as decisive in history. The author, however, believes that the Battle of Bautzen was the true turning point of the Napoleonic wars. Despite Napoleon's undeniable genius, the story portrays both his best and worst moments. The narrative aims to entertain with a love story while also shedding light on the horrors of war, showing the reader the other side beyond the glory and splendor.|"['1.

The grenadier proposed a plan: the Russians would scout, they would overpower them, don their uniforms, gather intelligence, and report back to the Emperor. While foraging, they captured a pig for roasting. As they approached cautiously for firewood, they were spotted. A scuffle ensued, ending with the Frenchmen subduing the Russians. Bound and silenced, the prisoners lay defeated. The grenadier's skill prevailed, leaving them victorious but puzzled by the unexpected encounter.|"['1.

The grenadier, recalling the atrocities in Russia, suggested sheltering the prisoners in a deserted house. The men were bound with ropes and left in the hut, secured from within. The Frenchmen disguised themselves in Russian garb. They found a pig, a welcome meal, and retreated to a safe spot to cook it. The grenadier retrieved his knife from the dead Russian.

When faced with the situation, he respected his young friend's rank. They took pieces of roast pig to the prisoners, who were still tied up and looking miserable. The grenadier noticed one prisoner trying to gnaw through the ropes to free the other. Realizing the men could escape soon, he informed his officer. With their gags removed, the prisoners had a chance to alert others, but there were no nearby listeners except a passing French peasant. The grenadier and his companion filled their bags with roast pig and headed back, observing the Russian troops camping for the day. They suspected a strategic move by the cavalry and decided to gather more information. Marteau planned to report to the Emperor after investigating the battle progress and troop movements.

"Marteau pondered for a moment before deciding on his plan. ""I'll head east first, then west, avoiding the division up ahead. Let's take the road to d'Aumenier. Meet me at the old château by ten or midnight at the latest. There's a by-road through the marsh and forest along the river to Sézanne."" The officer observed the old grenadier closely as he crossed the road and vanished into a cluster of fruit trees near an abandoned farmhouse. The young man waited, straining to hear any signs of trouble but all was silent. He turned eastwards, scanning the empty road, and ventured forth to explore further. The Château d'Aumenier's grand hall was aglow after many years. The historic estate sat in a wooded park near the village, overlooking a lake that fed into the Morin River. The old Marquis Henri had fled to England, leaving his brother Robert to navigate a changed world under Napoleon's rule. Robert, now the Count d'Aumenier, lived modestly, raising his daughter Laure with a mix of neglect and occasional wisdom from his well-stocked library. Laure, a dark-haired girl with a thirst for knowledge and unconventional skills, found solace among the estate's loyal servants. The Marquis, embittered by his brother's compromises, cut ties and lived in seclusion. Laure, yet unmarried, would have been a prize for the local gentry if not for her age"|"[""1.

Just before Napoleon embarked on his Russian campaign, Count Robert d'Aumenier passed away, leaving everything to his brother, the Marquis, along with his daughter, Laure. The Marquis, hesitant at first, was persuaded by an old family retainer, Jean Marteau, to take Laure under his care. Laure's education needed improvement, and her father's dying wish was for the Marquis to provide for her future. Jean Marteau had escorted Laure to her uncle and returned to manage the family estate. Young Jean Marteau, weary from a long journey, noticed light in the castle where Laure resided. Despite his fatigue, he knew the importance of delivering crucial information to the Emperor.

Marteau, a young man who had witnessed death several times, gently laid down the old man's head and arranged his limbs. He then turned to the poor girl, realizing the horrors she must have faced before her demise, like all the women in the village. Grateful that she was no longer suffering, he tenderly moved her to a settle by the fireplace. After a moment of contemplation, Marteau, unaffected by the irreligion of the time, knelt down to pray. As he prayed, his thoughts drifted to seeking revenge for his father and sister's deaths at the hands of the Cossacks. Remembering his duty to his Emperor and France, he hurried towards the grand house, where he was to meet his comrade. Upon arrival, he noticed the courtyard filled with army wagons, indicating a recent battle. Determined to uncover the truth behind the events, Marteau proceeded towards the château.|"[""1.

The front door was wide open, and there were no soldiers around, which seemed odd and a bit scary. Moving cautiously, he crossed the terrace and nearly tripped over two Russian soldiers lying on the ground. Inside, the entrance hall was dimly lit, with flickering light coming from a room on the right. Peering into the grand room, he saw a large fire burning and tables pushed together in the center. Men in uniforms were bound on the floor, while a woman stood bravely between two captors. The room was filled with unkempt, armed men shouting wildly. Among them, the woman he recognized as Laure d'Aumenier, held captive. Fueled by love and anger, he entered the room with his pistol drawn, determined to rescue her, despite the menacing leader's outburst.|"[""1.

Marteau, realizing the dangerous situation he was in, quickly dropped his weapon and raised his hands. He revealed his French uniform under his coat and tried to figure out how to respond to the group's questions. Unsure of their intentions, he decided to take a risk and claimed loyalty to Aumenier. The group, made up of desperate villagers affected by the war, explained how they had witnessed a Cossack attack on a wagon-train and were left with nothing but weapons. Marteau, trying to stay calm, inquired about the Cossacks' whereabouts. The men revealed that the Cossacks had been driven off by a small French force and were now gone.

Marteau swiftly retrieved the key despite the officer's objections, who glared disapprovingly at the woman's actions. He shared some with the peasant and offered it to the young woman, who declined. Weak and trembling, Marteau faced a choice: flee or fight. Duty urged him to run, but love compelled him to stay.

As the tense situation unfolded, Marteau took charge, collecting eight pistols left by the brigands. The English baronet handed over another, a large, antique firearm.

The sound of a gunshot and a cry above made Marteau realize what was happening. He quickly handed two pistols to Pierre and instructed him to watch the window above.

Blücher was skeptical of the news. He couldn't believe that Napoleon had managed to escape Schwarzenberg's forces. He found it hard to fathom that Napoleon would leave the Austrians unchallenged to head to Paris. Blücher doubted that Napoleon would dare to engage eighty thousand soldiers with only thirty thousand of his own.

Blücher paused, waiting for more information, while Sacken and Yorck, closer to the action, abandoned their pursuit of Macdonald to return. Olsuvieff valiantly defended his position until nightfall, but eventually had to surrender due to exhaustion and lack of ammunition.

As the young Emperor moved through his troops, he was greeted with cheers that reminded him of his past glories in Italy. Despite criticism for his decisions in battles like Borodino and Moscow, his strategic brilliance and tactical skills were unmatched. Although whispers of physical ailments and mental lapses circulated, his return to form during a crucial campaign in France was remarkable. Scouts brought vital information to his headquarters, leading to a pivotal decision to strike west. By targeting Blücher's van, he aimed to dismantle the enemy's support and secure a significant victory. Despite doubts and setbacks, the Emperor's determination and military acumen shone through, reminiscent of his early days as a daring leader on the battlefield.|"['1.

About ten miles to the west, on the road to Paris via La Ferte-sous-Jouarre, was the village of Montmirail. Further along the same road, Sacken and his twenty thousand soldiers were advancing. From Montmirail, a path led north to Château Thierry and the Marne crossing, where Macdonald was pushed back by Yorck with another fifteen thousand troops. The Emperor planned to capture Montmirail, send a group to block Yorck, and defeat Sacken with most of his army, leaving a unit at Champaubert to slow Blücher's progress. These units were actually small divisions of fewer than seven thousand soldiers. After rejoining the Emperor in the afternoon, Marteau decided to stay and help. Napoleon, after a brief rest, discussed with Marteau about his noble title and the confiscated Aumenier lands. Napoleon suggested that Marteau should consider the Countess Laure as a potential partner due to her courage and resolve.|"['1.

Nansouty's skilled cavalrymen were already alert, knowing their role in the battle on the eleventh of February. Marteau, representing the Emperor, gave the order as they swiftly prepared to move. Although they had no tents to pack, they quickly departed. Within thirty minutes, the squadrons were assembled, and Nansouty, accompanied by his staff and the young officer, led the charge. They swiftly advanced through Montmirail, pushing back the Russian forces at Vieux Maisons. Sacken's troops were caught off guard and scrambled to respond. The French cavalry engaged the Russian outposts, causing chaos in their ranks before retreating to the safety of the woods. Meanwhile, Napoleon strategically positioned his forces to counter Sacken's advance, orchestrating a successful trap that turned the tide of the battle in their favor.|"[""1.

The Count de Vivonne swiftly signaled his cavalry, who eagerly charged down the hill towards the Russian infantry at Épine-aux-Bois, turning their advance into a hasty retreat. Despite the Russians forming defensive squares and fighting stubbornly, Sacken realized his only hope was to join forces with Yorck. However, Yorck's progress was hindered by his mired guns, causing delays. Nansouty, under Napoleon's orders, decisively engaged the Russian columns, driving Sacken from the field. Sacken suffered heavy losses but was saved from total defeat by Yorck's arrival.

The following day, the thirteenth, Napoleon led his troops towards Château-Thierry after leaving a strong force to hold off any potential attack by Sacken. Yorck, having learned of Sacken's plight, had some of Sacken's brigades join him, bolstering his numbers. Despite this reinforcement, Yorck was no match for Napoleon, and he had to retreat, losing men, guns, and supplies in the process. Macdonald's delayed movements allowed Yorck to escape Napoleon's trap. Napoleon's forces captured many enemies and weapons, but also suffered losses. Blücher, realizing the danger, marched westward and engaged Marmont. The next day, Napoleon confronted Blücher, who had superior numbers but was demoralized. The French, inspired by recent victories, attacked Blücher at Vauchamps. The battle was fierce, with Napoleon's tactics and cavalry maneuvers turning the tide. The French pursued the retreating allies, with Grouchy's cavalry blocking their escape near Étoges.|"['1.

The allied regiments bravely fought their way through the French cavalry, losing some squares in the process. Blücher narrowly escaped capture, his forces exhausted after battles and a long march. Napoleon's troops, victorious but weary, faced the looming threat of Schwarzenberg's army. Despite advice to pursue Blücher, Napoleon chose to focus on Schwarzenberg.

Marteau's recollections included Napoleon's fierce determination and the sacrifices made by his fellow soldiers. The bravery of the Fifth-of-the-Line regiment, facing overwhelming odds, left a lasting impression on Marteau.

With shouts of anger, the Austrians were eager to seize the prized Eagle in war. The officer who captured it was highly esteemed. But as they aimed to strike him down, other officers intervened. Pierre and the officer were taken as captives. Before they were marched away, the officer whispered to Pierre to remember where the Eagle vanished in the waters. While in Salzburg as prisoners, they learned of Napoleon's downfall and exile. Marteau fell ill but was cared for by Pierre. Marteau missed his old friend, Bullet-Stopper. As they stood above Grenoble, they saw a white flag. The guard at the town gate recognized Marteau, but Marteau, in disguise, went unnoticed.

Five individuals gathered around the fireplace, engaged in cheerful talk. The weather outside on the second of March made the crackling fire especially inviting. Among the group were four men and a woman. The woman was the first to notice a newcomer entering the room, causing her to drop a cup, shattering it. The man was elegantly dressed, hinting at a military background despite not wearing a uniform. The Marquis d'Aumenier, the eldest in the group, inquired about the newcomer, drawing everyone's attention. An older man recognized the newcomer as a Frenchman who had shared an experience at a château. The Englishman's son, Captain Frank Yeovil, was introduced, set to marry the Marquis' niece. Tensions arose as past connections and unspoken feelings were subtly acknowledged.|"['1.

The Countess was deeply moved. She had thought Captain Yeovil was dead, killed in battle. The Marquis offered him a captaincy in his regiment, a generous gesture. Captain Yeovil, grateful, attempted to return the estates that rightfully belonged to the Countess. The old Baronet intervened, affirming that they didn't need the dowry as they had their own wealth.

"""It seems to me, gentlemen,"" the Marquis calmly stated, ""that I am responsible for resolving this matter. Marteau was right, and I was wrong. He may have a legitimate claim to the estate. Regardless, he is wise to return it to its original owner. I will accept it as my rightful due. I will ensure he faces no repercussions for his generosity.""

""As a person gazes at the sun for sustenance,"" the young Frenchman expressed, ""I look towards mademoiselle. But fear not, sir,"" he assured the English dragoon, ""you have captured her heart. I envy you, but--""

The young Frenchman's refined appearance starkly contrasted with the rugged English soldier to whom she was engaged but not emotionally attached. Her affections were clear. The pride of heritage had eroded in the aftermath of the revolution. She had mingled with commoners on the ancestral land for too long, forming a deep bond with Marteau. However, this was a secret she kept even from herself.

In all fairness, any assistance Marteau provided was in line with the old noble's sense of propriety and the longstanding feudal tradition of mutual service between their families.

The Marquis praised Captain Yeovil for his gentlemanly behavior as he helped his betrothed to her feet. The Marquis then toasted to their health and expressed his pride in the young man. He offered Captain Yeovil a commission, showing his respect and admiration. The Countess seemed moved by the interaction, but the moment was fleeting as the Captain disappeared. Later that night, a group of soldiers, carefully selected and dressed in their finest uniforms, gathered in Major Lestoype's quarters. The atmosphere was solemn and secretive, indicating the importance of the meeting. The soldiers, ranging from non-commissioned officers to privates, were chosen with great care.

The men gathered were all known for their loyalty and bravery. Major Lestoype, a former private turned officer, had served alongside the Emperor during the remarkable campaigns in Italy and Egypt. He held a special bond with the regimental Eagle, a symbol of their unity and strength. The men, adorned with medals and honors, awaited the return of their Eagle with eager anticipation. When the door opened, revealing Major Lestoype and a young man boldly wearing the insignia of Napoleon, the room fell silent. Major Lestoype urged caution, as the situation was delicate.

"He paused for a dramatic moment, as if the scene was planned. Marteau, with his hand hidden behind his back, revealed it in front of him as Lestoype halted. In the candlelight, from the chandelier above, officers and soldiers saw the revered emblem, causing varied reactions. Some eyes sparkled, others teared up, cheeks paled or flushed, breaths quickened, and a murmur filled the room. A veteran cried ""_Vive l'Empereur!_"" The room echoed with the battle-cry, passing from man to man like a sigh. Lestoype, trembling, seized the Eagle, feeling the Emperor's presence. He recounted a day on the Champ de Mars when the Emperor entrusted the Eagle to them, asking for their unwavering loyalty and honor. The soldiers drew their swords in a show of allegiance.

Once more, the soldiers found themselves demoted. Many were forced into retirement without pay, while those who remained were replaced by unfit old royal army officers or inexperienced nobles. The army was discontent, drained by years of war, seeking peace. The people were indifferent, craving rest. Yet, some officers like Marteau remained loyal to the Emperor, rejecting titles and honors. The King and his advisors were aware of the unrest, with the Marquis d'Aumenier understanding the depth of the soldiers' discontent. The King knew he must act decisively in Grenoble.

Laure d'Aumenier found herself torn between two suitors, Captain Yeovil and the deceased Marteau. Initially betrothed to Yeovil due to her uncle's insistence, she had developed feelings for Marteau. However, with Marteau's reported death, she realized the impossibility of marrying him due to her family's expectations. Despite her grief, she knew she would be pressured to honor her engagement to Yeovil. The arrival of Yeovil had shattered her romantic dreams, forcing her to face the reality of her situation.

Laure d'Aumenier lay awake, exhausted by the day's events. Suddenly, she heard a faint noise in her room. Alert and brave, she reached for her dueling pistol and wrapped herself in a gown. With the storm raging outside, she stealthily approached the intruder on the other side of her bed. Despite the urge to call for help, Laure remained composed, ready to confront the mysterious presence. Her courage and training in swordsmanship and marksmanship gave her the confidence to face the unknown intruder.

The woman waited anxiously in her room, feeling the tension rise as mysterious movements behind the curtains unsettled her. Just as she reached her breaking point, a noise caught her attention.

Startled, he revealed himself in the candlelight, expressing astonishment at the unexpected encounter. The woman, initially shocked to find a thief in her room, was even more surprised to realize it was someone she knew and cared for deeply.

When I first arrived at this place as part of the regiment, the château was empty. I roamed every inch of it, exploring its hidden corners. By chance, I stumbled upon a secret hiding spot where the Eagle now rests. The woman, lost in the moment, forgot about the late hour, her attire, and the unconventional nature of their meeting. All she could see was the man she adored, feeling his love for her. Despite his humble origins, he expressed his deep affection, acknowledging the obstacles to their love. He urged her to decide his fate, either to hand him over or to forget him. With a mix of pride and sorrow, he accepted her decision, knowing his capture was imminent. The sudden commotion outside signaled his impending discovery, prompting him to bid a swift farewell to the distraught woman.|"['1.

She reached out to him once more. She appeared very beautiful, with the peignoir slipping from her delicate shoulders, the gentle candlelight revealing and yet hiding the beauty of her face and form in its soft shadows. Marteau didn't want to think about that. He needed to act immediately. He hurried toward her, grasped her hand, and even shook her slightly. He picked up the gun she had dropped on the bed and aimed it upward, pulling the trigger. Startled by his sudden move, she screamed loudly. The door burst open, and the Marquis, Sir Gervaise Yeovil, and a young Captain entered, accompanied by servants and guards carrying lights. Marteau could only bow. He had a brief moment to decide on his next move. He knew his life was in danger, but he would sacrifice it for her safety. Any explanation he offered would not be believed unless he produced the Eagle, which was not an option. Without the Eagle, the more he tried to explain, the more he would implicate the woman he loved.|"['1.

Her lover attempted to take her hand, but she shrank away from him. As Sir Gervaise passed her she bent forward and seized the old Baronet's hand and kissed it. He, at least, had seen that there was something beneath the surface.

From the few loyalist officers in the regiments and in the town, a court had been convened to put Marteau on trial. He was found guilty of various crimes, including treason and disobedience of orders. The Marquis, acting with full powers on the old feudal idea of possessing all rights, influenced the court to sentence the young soldier to death. Despite appeals and protests, Marteau accepted his fate. The Marquis, though admiring Marteau's determination, remained resolute in punishing him for treason. The Marquis, accustomed to having his way, was frustrated by Marteau's stubbornness. The Marquis sought to save Marteau due to his gallantry in a previous incident involving the Countess Laure. The Countess defended Marteau's innocence, but the Marquis remained puzzled by the situation. The court-martial focused on Marteau's actions related to the Eagle, not on theft or assault.|"['1.

On a sunny spring morning in 1815, the troops gathered at the parade-ground. The old Seventh-of-the-Line veterans, led by Colonel Labédoyère, stood alongside the Fifth regiment under Major Lestoype. Officers like Grenier and Drehon with their companies, all in their white cockades and heavy marching gear, shone in the sunlight. The artillery lined the walls, and the household cavalry accompanied the Marquis, looking regal on his horse. The white flag of France, with a golden lily, led the column, drums rolled, and arms were presented. The troops, silent and uncertain, learned of Napoleon's return, marching with a small force towards Grenoble. The news spread fast, reaching Paris before Grenoble, prompting the government to act swiftly against Napoleon's advance.|"['1.

The men were drawing closer, their arms ready. Drums beat loudly at their front. Would they engage in combat with the Guard? Suddenly, a figure on a white horse emerged.

The Emperor Napoleon returned from Elba, reorganized the government, and rebuilt the army. He prepared for war, though he did not desire it. Europe was surprised by his return and swiftly united against him. The Congress of Vienna, previously divided, now joined forces to face Napoleon. Russia, Prussia, and Austria agreed to field large armies, with England providing support. The Duke of Wellington, a skilled commander, was chosen to lead the allied forces against Napoleon.

In the past, assembling, arming, and moving a large army was a challenging task, even for a prosperous country. Napoleon had exceptional organizing skills, unlike his opponents. By June, his enemies were not fully prepared. The Austrians had made little progress, while the Russians were slow to mobilize. The English, Prussians, Belgians, and Dutch were quicker to act. Napoleon, leading 125,000 men, aimed to face the English-Prussian army in Belgium. Despite facing potential opposition from half a million enemies, Napoleon sought victory to regain his former glory. The devotion of his army to him was remarkable, driven by a mysterious attachment to Napoleon himself. This personal loyalty, though powerful, could not replace the enduring love for one's country that inspires heroic acts. Napoleon's hold over his soldiers, even a century later, remains a unique phenomenon.|"[""1.

The army that Napoleon had assembled was truly formidable, with every soldier being a seasoned veteran. Many of them had fought alongside Napoleon for over fifteen years, participating in countless battles. These soldiers were the cream of the crop, carefully selected for their skills, experience, and appearance to join the prestigious Old Guard. While the army was filled with battle-hardened veterans, some notable marshals were missing, either imprisoned, in exile, or retired. Soult and Ney were among the few remaining marshals who stood by Napoleon's side. The rest of the officers were younger and less known, leading a diverse army that lacked cohesion and familiarity. Despite their individual prowess, the army needed victories to come together as a unified force.|"[""1.

The critical question loomed large: Could Napoleon's army endure and triumph? What if victory eluded them? How would they fare under pressure? Could their unity withstand defeat? Would the rest of the army match the Guard's prowess? These were the pivotal concerns. Napoleon faced a significant numerical disadvantage against the allied forces he aimed to confront. Despite this, his audacity and strategic brilliance shone through. He planned to maneuver his army between the enemy's divided wings, aiming to outmaneuver and conquer each segment successively. Napoleon's daring strategy involved risking his forces against two equally matched opponents, banking on his tactical acumen to secure triumph. However, the peril of failure loomed large, with the threat of being ensnared in the enemy's trap ever present. Napoleon's confidence in his strategy was unwavering, yet the outcome remained uncertain.|"[""1.

In intricate detail, Napoleon's initial strategy aimed to confuse Wellington on the right of the allied line. The plan was to strike before Wellington could regroup, either defeating or containing him with Ney's detachment. Meanwhile, Napoleon would personally deal with Blücher. He nearly executed this plan flawlessly, successfully carrying it out until the final battle day. Napoleon believed that defeating Blücher and threatening his supply lines would force the Prussian army to retreat eastward. He expected to then defeat Wellington swiftly. However, his assumptions backfired; the Prussians, under Gneisenau, retreated north instead of east, defying Napoleon's expectations.

The outcome of the battles at Ligny and Quatre Bras during the Napoleonic Wars could have been different if not for a series of strategic errors. Ney, despite a chance at victory, lost the opportunity due to confusion in orders. D'Erlon's corps, a formidable force, wasted time marching back and forth between battles without engaging effectively. Napoleon's failure to utilize d'Erlon's troops further compounded the missed opportunities. The subsequent Battle of Waterloo saw Blücher's Prussian forces regrouping to support Wellington, who positioned his army strategically on a ridge near the village of Waterloo. Key locations like Hougomont and La Haye Sainte played crucial roles in the ensuing battle. Grouchy's delayed actions and failure to support Napoleon's plan further complicated the situation. Ultimately, the battles hinged on a series of missed opportunities, miscommunications, and strategic errors that shaped the course of history.|"[""1.

The Duke had 67,000 men and 180 guns, expecting Napoleon to attack the right side, counting on Blücher's support. Napoleon had 75,000 men and 260 guns. Blücher, with 80,000 men and 200 guns, was at Wavre, while Grouchy had 35,000 soldiers. The valley was cultivated, with ripening grain in fields separated by hedges. The weather was terrible, with heavy rain turning fields and roads into mud. Napoleon waited for the ground to dry before attacking in the afternoon. Wellington chose to defend, wasting time as Blücher approached. Grouchy, realizing the Prussians were at Wavre, turned north. Napoleon, normally alert, was drowsy that day, even seen sleeping at times. His plan was to feint at Hougomont, weaken Wellington's line, then break through the left center with massed attacks under artillery fire.|"[""1.

Napoleon, a skilled strategist, jumped from regimental officer to General, bypassing lower army ranks. Delegating details to subordinates, he launched a grand assault, concentrating fire on the English left. D'Erlon's corps, eager for success, formed in columns under commanders. However, their close formation hindered movement and made them an easy target. Despite strong leadership and troops, attacking in columns against the English line posed challenges. The French artillery kept the English at bay until the infantry reached the ridge. The English, though exhausted, stood firm. Wellington reinforced the threatened area with heavy cavalry, preparing for the French assault. The English, disciplined and resolute, faced the advancing French columns with determination, ready to defend their ground against Napoleon's forces.|"[""1.
