Once upon a time, in the wilderness of the Mustang Valley, a brave and adventurous dog named Crusoe was born. The valley, surrounded by wild horses and untamed lands, was home to squatters seeking a new life far from the bustling frontier settlements. Led by Major Hope, a skilled marksman and nature enthusiast, the settlers built log huts and a sturdy block-house for protection against the lurking dangers of the Red Indians. Crusoe, a pup at the time, grew up amidst the rugged beauty of the valley, playing and exploring the vast wilderness. As he matured into a powerful and majestic dog, he became a loyal companion and guardian to the settlers, ready to face any challenge that came their way.|['1.

Crusoe's parents were magnificent Newfoundland dogs, given as a parting gift from a brother officer. The father, Crusoe, and the mother, Fan, came from Newfoundland itself. The father's name was a mystery, while the mother was named after the fisherman's wife who owned her. When Crusoe, the father, was given away and lost, his son, Crusoe Jr., was born without a name. The young hunter, Dick Varley, watched Sioux Indians set up camp near the block-house during the Indian summer. The Indians prepared supper while an ill-favoured squaw tended to a pot over the fire. Dick Varley, unlike other backwoods hunters, was spirited and loved solitary wanderings in the woods. His earnest and lively nature made him different from his companions. His candid face, bright-blue eyes, and reddish-brown hair set him apart.|"[""1. What were Crusoe's parents?\nA) Cats\nB) Horses\nC) Newfoundland dogs\nD) Parrots\nE) Rabbits"", ""2.

The young man laughed at the baby playing with a pup until the Indian woman cruelly attacked the pup. The youth, named Varley, recognized the pup as Crusoe and was furious. He rescued Crusoe and confronted the woman. Varley was a serious and skilled hunter, while his friend Blunt was Irish-American and a good shooter. Crusoe was saved by Varley's mother despite being singed by the fire. Major Hope, the leader of the settlers, decided to leave and distributed his belongings. He offered Crusoe and a rifle as a prize for the best shot in the valley. A shooting competition was held by the river, but Dick's rifle misfired, making it hard to determine if it was his poor shooting or the rifle's fault.|"[""1.

A dozen hunters arrived at the scene, appearing strong and fearless. The major followed with a unique rifle, accompanied by his dog Fan and her pup Crusoe. The rifle had a special feature with two sets of locks, one percussion, and the other flint. The major set the terms for a shooting contest to win the rifle, Fan, and her pup. Henri, a giant but clumsy man, stepped forward to drive a nail to win the prize. Despite his awkwardness, Henri was well-liked for his good-natured spirit. He was known for his exceptional stalking skills when hunting, despite his size and clumsiness. Henri's unique ability to move silently and his strength in wrestling and running made him stand out among his peers. Although he struggled with certain aspects of backwoods life, his determination and luck often helped him succeed.|[]|[]
"The hunters in the far west used a rifle practice called ""driving the nail"" to test their shooting skills. They fired at a nail from a distance until they drove it into a plank. The major decided to challenge the hunters by increasing the distance to seventy yards. Jim, a long and lank hunter, was not well-liked by his companions due to his appearance. The hunters used Kentucky rifles with small bullets called pea-rifles. They quickly loaded their rifles, aimed, and fired. The competition was intense, with each shot hitting close to the nail. When it was Jim's turn, his shot hit the nail's edge. The hunters cheered as they prepared for a rematch between Jim and Dick, with Dick using a different rifle. However, a commotion caused by a puppy distracted Jim, leading to a missed shot. Jim's anger was redirected towards the puppy, but Henri intervened, preventing harm to the innocent dog. Despite the interruption, the major handed a silver rifle to young Varley, expressing confidence in his shooting abilities."|['1.

Dick was surrounded by hunters who congratulated him on his unexpected good fortune. Feeling a mix of bashfulness and delight, he quietly left the crowd to approach a boy named Marston. Marston, who had longed for a rifle, was overjoyed when Dick handed him his old rifle. However, a new problem arose as Dick's loyal dog, Fan, refused to leave him. After a moment of hesitation, Fan decided to follow Dick to his cottage by the lake. Dick's mother, a widow who had left her peaceful village to join her brother in the backwoods, welcomed them with a loving look that radiated a rare kind of beauty.

Young Varley's mother lived in a small cottage made of logs in Mustang Valley. The house had a central door leading to two rooms. Mrs. Varley's bedroom was separated by a thin partition from Dick's room. Daniel Hood slept in a corner of the kitchen, which also served as a parlour. The cottage had two windows on each side of the door, giving it a peculiar appearance like a face with eyes and a nose. The stunning view of the clear lake and distant hills always amazed visitors. Dick, eager to hunt, sought his mother's permission. As a group of horsemen, trappers heading to the Rocky Mountains, arrived, Dick joined them for an adventure.

Young Varley's excitement waned upon learning the trappers' mission. He abandoned the desire to join them in the mountains but yearned to explore the rocky terrain and vast prairies. He focused on caring for his mother's livestock and occasional hunting. Training his dog, Crusoe, proved challenging at first. Crusoe, a Newfoundland dog, showed signs of intelligence. His first lesson involved fetching a mitten, which he joyfully worried instead. Varley tried to reward Crusoe with meat, but the pup remained fixated on the mitten. Varley then withheld Crusoe's breakfast, prompting the pup to focus on the lesson. Despite initial struggles, Crusoe's devotion to Varley grew, prioritizing companionship over food.|"[""1.

Dick Varley began Crusoe's training by using a piece of meat to entice him. Crusoe, eager to eat it, was stopped, causing him immense displeasure. The mitten was then thrown, and although Crusoe initially approached it, he wasn't in the mood for play and turned back. After a few attempts, Crusoe finally picked up the mitten in his mouth, a crucial step towards his canine education. Varley rewarded him with affection and more meat. Crusoe learned that fetching the mitten led to rewards. Over time, Crusoe's training progressed. He became a skilled companion for hunting, with exceptional swimming abilities and a sharp intellect. He could retrieve items from deep waters, track back long distances, and perform various tasks with precision.

Crusoe, the majestic Newfoundland dog, was immense in size but gentle in expression. He walked quietly with his master, Dick Varley, but was magnificent when excited during a chase. Crusoe obeyed commands instantly, putting the settlement boys to shame with his prompt obedience. His eyes were the chief means of communication, expressing a range of emotions. Crusoe's tail also conveyed messages, wagging with various meanings. Despite being bitten by ill-natured dogs, Crusoe remained meek and protected the weak.

During a conversation, a small dog with a hurt leg hobbled up to where Dick was sitting and peered into the deep water. A larger aggressive dog appeared and attacked the small dog. Crusoe, Dick's loyal dog, swiftly intervened, saving the small dog from harm. Crusoe was not just a servant; he had his own adventures in the woods and by the lake. Accompanied by a little dog named Grumps, Crusoe explored nature, showing a keen interest in plants and rocks. Grumps, in awe of Crusoe, followed him everywhere except into the water, as Grumps despised it. When Dick's whistle echoed, Crusoe raced off, leaving Grumps behind. Later, an officer and cavalry arrived in Mustang Valley to improve relations with Native Americans, led by Joe Blunt. Dick, meanwhile, cleaned his rifle as his mother chatted about their hen's egg-laying habits, while Crusoe observed the scene.|[]|[]
"Joe responded, ""I'd blame Fan for this, if she hadn't been born, neither would Crusoe. But it's good meat, however you cook it. But I have other news.

For a while, they rode silently alongside each other, lost in their own thoughts. Crusoe stuck close to his master's horse. The older hunters pondered their mission and chances of success, their faces serious and eyes fixed on the ground. Dick Varley, on the other hand, was filled with excitement at his first adventure. His mind raced with images of mountains, plains, Indians, bears, and more. The lush scenery passed by them as they rode, with forests, open fields, and streams painting a beautiful landscape. Joe Blunt, accustomed to such beauty, reminded Varley that familiarity can make one overlook the wonders around them.

The little antelope on the North American prairies is very curious and will investigate anything it finds mysterious. Dick used this trait to attract the antelope by waving a rag on a rod. The antelope, intrigued by the movement, cautiously approached. When the flag was lowered, a shot rang out, and the antelope fell. Crusoe, the dog, then startled the horse to set it running while he controlled the reins. As the sun set, Joe found a serene campsite by a stream. In the prairies, horses are hobbled to limit their movement. Indians are known to steal horses, even from enemy tribes, with remarkable stealth. Despite precautions, thieves can sneak into camps, cut horse lariats, and escape unnoticed. The group enjoyed a peaceful evening under the birch tree, free from such dangers.|['1.

In the dim evening light, a warm fire glowed, creating a cozy circle for the hunters. After supper, they enjoyed tea and pipes, chatting happily. Soon, they settled down for the night, each using a saddle as a pillow, rifles close by. Crusoe, the loyal dog, stood guard. At dawn, Dick Varley woke, embracing Crusoe with joy. They set off into the woods, Crusoe playfully following. Dick quickly readied the horses, and the group prepared to depart. Overwhelmed by the vast prairie before him, Dick let out a triumphant yell and galloped off, the others following in exhilaration.

Joe argued that humans are meant to experience a mix of joys and troubles. He warned about the challenges they might face in the prairie, such as the scarcity of water, rattlesnakes, badger holes, and the threat of encountering Indigenous people. As they rode through the barren plain, they encountered a colony of prairie-dogs, which were actually marmots. These creatures lived in burrows and behaved boldly despite being timid. They chattered and showed their teeth at the approaching hunters but quickly retreated into their holes when threatened.

Prairie-dogs, or rather prairie-doggies, had a peculiar companionship with owls in their dwellings across the plains. Each doggie shared its home with an owl, a unique partnership witnessed by many trustworthy travelers. The owls seemed to rely on the doggies for their burrows, as they themselves couldn't dig. This unlikely pairing lived harmoniously, with each hole housing one doggie and one owl. The reason behind this strange cohabitation remains a mystery, but it's believed the owls took over the holes due to their need for shelter. There are rumors of rattlesnakes joining these odd households, adding to the diversity of creatures in the region. As rain poured down, the group sought shelter under makeshift cover, enduring the wet and slobbery conditions with resilience and camaraderie, a lesson in facing challenges with a positive outlook.|"['1.

The hunters had a satisfying meal and drank rainwater from a hut's pool. They tried to sleep but the darkness made it hard. They ended up staying up, sharing stories, and drying their wet clothes by the morning sun. They lit a fire, made soup, and felt much better. They rode off, feeling more comfortable, despite the mosquitoes and flies. Joe predicted they would soon find buffaloes, and they approached quietly, ready for the hunt.

Dick raised his head as instructed and was met with a breathtaking sight. The vast plain ahead was covered with numerous herds of bison grazing on the lush grass. In the foreground, a group of buffalo cows peacefully fed while a massive old bull wallowed in the midst. These fierce creatures, often mistaken as buffalo, are actually bison, the largest ruminants in the western wilderness. Their dark brown fur lightens in winter but turns jet-black in spring. The bison's formidable appearance is accentuated by its large hump, shaggy mane, and cloven hoofs. Despite their ferocity, bison can be easily startled due to their limited vision range. When wounded, a bison can charge with the fury of a tiger, but their clumsy pace allows skilled hunters to outmaneuver them. The sight of a stampeding herd of bison is a terrifying yet awe-inspiring spectacle in the wild plains.|"['1.

A large buffalo bull delighted Dick Varley by creating a mud bath. The bull tore up the mud with its horns, then rolled in it until covered. The other buffaloes watched approvingly. After finishing his bath, another bull attempted to take a turn but was interrupted by hunters. The chaos caused all the buffaloes to flee in fear. However, a young cow was wounded by Joe's rifle and brought down by Dick. Unsatisfied, Dick reloaded his rifle and pursued the wounded bull. When the bull charged at him, Dick stood his ground and fired, but missed the heart. The bull turned and charged again, causing Dick to panic and fire a second shot that also missed.

I suggest we ride swiftly to the sand hills ahead to spy on the Native Americans. If they are Pawnees, we'll approach; if not, we'll strategize. They mounted and hurried to the hillocks, reaching them after a quick gallop. The mounds hid them, allowing them to observe the savages below. The scene was intense; the plain teemed with hundreds of buffaloes in a panic. The savages, armed and on horseback, encircled the herd, closing in on them. Chaos ensued as the Indians attacked the buffaloes, creating a cloud of dust. The battle was fierce, with some buffaloes retaliating and injuring the horses. The hunters watched as the savages hunted the herd. The savages noticed the hunters, gathering and brandishing weapons. Joe rode towards the chief, halting abruptly near him.

Mahtawa, a Native American chief, expressed distrust towards the Pale-faces, believing they are never satisfied and always seeking more. This caused concern among the hunters as they feared for their safety. Just as tensions rose, another chief, more authoritative and intimidating than Mahtawa, arrived on the scene. Joe, one of the hunters, attempted to convey a message of peace from the Pale-faces, emphasizing a desire for harmony between the two groups.

The gun was fixed quickly, and our hunters rode with the Native Americans towards their camp. Along the way, they encountered many women and children heading to the great hunt to help cut and transport the meat. The men, feeling their duty was done in the kill, returned to rest. Dick Varley noticed some of the warriors eating raw buffalo liver, which disgusted him. The vast plain sloped down to a creek with a line of trees marking its course. Tents made of buffalo skins covered the ground, with thousands of Indians moving about. Children played with bows and arrows, practicing their skills. The tribes depended on hunting buffalo for survival, despite the risks. The hunters were welcomed into the chief's tent, where they were seated and their horses cared for.

Joe gave a part of the goods to the chief and kept the rest. The promise of annual gifts stopped the savages from taking everything without permission. The struggle to hold back was evident, and Joe knew they had to be cautious to complete their mission safely. After inspecting the goods, the chief allowed the Pale-faces to talk with the braves in a forthcoming council for peace. Joe, however, worried about giving away too much as they had other tribes to visit. The chief, San-it-sa-rish, prepared meticulously for the council, greasing his body with buffalo fat and adorning himself with ornaments and paint.

The incident did not end there. Tarwicadia stopped immediately after passing, but the Canadian kept going. His large frame couldn't be stopped instantly. The crowd of Indians made way for him, but a tent in his path wasn't as accommodating. He crashed into it, bringing it down along with its occupants, including children and dogs.

At a Native American feast, guests must all be present before the meal can start. The men sat facing each other in two rows, ready to eat a massive pot of maize porridge. Before they could dig in, an elder spoke in praise of the feast giver, followed by others who spoke passionately about war, peace, and hospitality. Each couple was served a bowl of porridge, but first, a portion was set aside for the gods in a ceremony. The rule was to eat every bite quickly, with the fastest eater being admired. Even children puffed up from overeating. The Indians, accustomed to feast or famine, could eat astonishing amounts. Henri struggled to finish his portion, falling in the savages' estimation for being last.

One night, Henri lay on his back in the chief's tent, gazing at the stars, and envying Joe Blunt's loud snoring. The village dogs then put on a vocal concert, howling madly under the night sky. Crusoe, the dog, initially bristled with indignation but relaxed once he realized the source of the noise. Dick Varley pondered his predicament in the Pawnee village, contemplating their escape. Joe expressed concern about Mahtawa's intentions to take their goods and possibly their lives. The Indians were amazed by Dick's rifle, especially his ability to shoot accurately and reload quickly, leaving them in awe. Dick found their fascination amusing and planned to reveal the rifle's secret before departing.|"[""1.

Henri, unaware of the language, couldn't grasp the preceding dialogue. He sensed the unpleasant tone. When the rifle was abruptly taken from him, he reacted swiftly, reclaiming it from the Indian's hold and pushing him out. Mahtawa, enraged, drew a knife and lunged at Henri, but Dick intervened, holding him back. The commotion attracted more warriors who pinned Henri down despite his resistance. Joe Blunt mediated, urging for peace and the return of the rifle to avoid conflict. The situation calmed, and Henri was freed. Later, around the campfire, the friends planned their escape from the tribe's potential threats. Joe expressed concerns about the challenges ahead, but Henri, still angry, proposed a bold escape plan.|['1.

"Joe shook his head. ""A hundred arrows would be in our backs before we got twenty yards from the camp. Besides, we can't tell which are the best horses. Our own are the best in my opinion, but how are we to get them?"" ""Well, they're troublesome. We can't get the horses out of camp without being seen, for the red rascals would see what we were at in a jiffy. Then, if we do get them out, we can't go off without our bales, and we needn't think to take them from under the nose of the chief and his squaws without being asked questions. To go off without them would never do at all."" It may be as well to note here that no restraint had been put on the hunters' movements as long as they stayed on foot, as escaping from mounted Indians on the plains would be hopeless. The savages believed that as long as there was a chance of leaving peacefully with their goods, the hunters wouldn't risk their lives by fleeing. So, the hunters had been allowed to wander freely, paddling about the lake and shooting wild-fowl. Dick led the way to the lake, talking and laughing loudly to avoid suspicion. They launched a canoe, paddled swiftly to the opposite shore, and then hurried through the wood to the prairie. They ran to the bluff from behind. ""Come here, good pup; that will do.

For three days, Joe pleased the Native Americans with gifts and tales of the white men's wealth. Meanwhile, Dick quietly took items from their supplies, replacing them with leather scraps. He hid the goods on himself and, with Crusoe, headed to the village outskirts. There, he gave the dog a bundle to carry away. The dog swiftly ran off towards the river's ford. Gradually, the goods were moved by the dog to a safe spot while the fake pack remained in the chief's tent. Joe decided to escape, choosing a dark night. The Indian woman took the horses for firewood, while Mahtawa, suspicious, followed the hunters. Joe and his companions subdued Mahtawa and swiftly moved him across the prairie. They secured him to a tree, and the dog guarded him, allowing the group to prepare for their journey.|"[""1.

The faint sound reached the willow bluff, and the moon revealed Crusoe's intense stare at the unarmed Indian chief. Hearing a whistle, the chief fled through the bushes like an arrow. Mahtawa ran to the village, raising the war-whoop. The Indian camp quickly armed, ready to pursue. The fugitives raced through various terrains until dawn. Excitement and fatigue prepared them for rest under a willow bush, enjoying antelope steak by a warm fire. The horses grazed nearby, ensuring safety. The camp was filled with the scent of wildflowers, the sound of a rivulet, and the comfort of blankets. Crusoe, always alert, kept watch. The Pale-faces were grateful for their escape and current peace, with Crusoe by their side, never fully asleep.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did the moon reveal about Crusoe?\nA) His fear of the Indian chief\nB) His intense stare at the Indian chief\nC) His desire for peace\nD) His intention to attack\nE) His exhaustion from the chase', 'Question 2:\nWhat did Mahtawa do upon hearing a whistle?\nA) Fled through the bushes\nB) Raised the war-whoop in the village\nC) Ate antelope steak by the fire\nD) Rested under a willow bush\nE) Grazed the horses nearby', 'Question 3:\nWhat prepared the fugitives for rest under a willow bush?\nA) Fear of pursuit\nB) Excitement and fatigue\nC) Hunger for antelope steak\nD) The sound of a rivulet\nE) The scent of wildflowers', ""Question 4:\nWhat ensured the safety of the camp during rest?\nA) The scent of wildflowers\nB) The sound of a rivulet\nC) The comfort of blankets\nD) The grazing horses nearby\nE) Crusoe's alertness"", 'Question 5:\nWhat filled the camp during rest?\nA) The scent of antelope steak\nB) The sound of a whistle\nC) The comfort of blankets\nD) The sight of the Indian chief\nE) The scent of wildflowers', 'Question 6:\nWhy was Crusoe never fully asleep?\nA) Fear of the Indian chief\nB) Excitement from the chase\nC) Desire for peace\nD) Alertness to keep watch\nE) Exhaustion from the pursuit']"|['B) His intense stare at the Indian chief', 'B) Raised the war-whoop in the village', 'B) Excitement and fatigue', 'D) The grazing horses nearby', 'E) The scent of wildflowers', 'D) Alertness to keep watch']
Before the sun rose the next morning, Joe was up and preparing to leave while his companions, Dick and Henri, were still reluctant to wake up. Henri's pipe falling near his face caused him to inhale some ashes, prompting him to cough and wake up. Henri, irritated, scolded Dick for not getting up. Suddenly, Dick's horse stumbled in a badger hole, throwing him off. After a brief check, Dick was fine, and they continued their journey. Accidents like this were common on the prairies due to the uneven terrain. The group was hunting a prong-horned antelope, known for its speed and keen senses. The antelopes' curiosity made them easier to hunt, despite their agility. The narrative compares these curious antelopes to individuals in society who share similar characteristics. Henri advised against chasing the antelope and predicted they would soon encounter buffalo as fresh tracks indicated their presence.|"[""1.

A group of buffalo was spotted in the distance, but the hunters refrained from pursuing them as they had already taken down a red-deer the day before. The red-deer is larger than the prong-horned antelope and is valued for both its meat and its skin, which turns into leather when processed. Despite having enough food, the hunters couldn't resist chasing a herd of nine buffaloes that suddenly appeared. Joe, inspired by his friend, urged Henri to join him in the chase. The buffaloes ran surprisingly fast, challenging the hunters and their horses. Eventually, they closed in on the herd, with each hunter selecting their target. A tense moment ensued as Henri faced a fierce bull, misinterpreting its tail signal. A dangerous encounter followed, leading to Henri's fall. The hunters reflected on their actions, regretting the unnecessary killings. Wolves lurked around, eyeing the hunters, but were not a concern. The travelers later encountered a wounded buffalo attacked by white wolves, illustrating the harsh realities of the wild.|"['1.

The aged bull the travelers encountered had clearly been in a long battle with fierce foes. His body was torn and bloodied, evidence of his valiant fight against dozens of wolves. As the hunters approached, the wolves circled the bull, waiting for their chance to scavenge. With a heavy heart, Joe took aim and ended the bull's suffering. The wolves scattered briefly but soon returned, knowing they would feast on the remains. After reaching a creek, the men stopped to eat. Joe marveled at the constant need for food, unlike snakes that can go long periods without eating. Dick's sharp eye spotted a wild turkey, providing them with a meal. Despite this unexpected bounty, Dick went hunting for more food, finding prairie hens and wild fruit. He concocted a unique dish, mixing the fruits with flour and turkey fat to create a thick porridge.|"['1.

In a vast prairie, three hunters sought a Sioux Indian village, facing pesky mosquitoes and horse-flies. The bloodsucking pests tormented the horses, causing blood to trickle down their sides. Cockchafers and locusts added to the annoyance by flying into their faces, narrowly missing their eyes. While searching, they encountered scattered Indian groups, which they avoided to evade potential danger. The hunters cooked cautiously during the day, fearing Indians at night. Desperately thirsty, they found a salty stream but filtered the water to make it drinkable. Suddenly pursued by savages, they spurred their horses, racing across the prairie. The chase intensified, with both parties riding at breakneck speed. The hunters aimed for a distant forest, hoping to outpace their pursuers and make a stand if needed.|"[""1.

Joe warned Dick about the danger of being caught by the Indians. They quickly dashed through shrubbery to evade their pursuers. Dick's faithful dog, Crusoe, tried to protect him but was tripped by an Indian's lasso. Despite the chaos, Dick managed to navigate a stream and outpace the Indians. However, his horse stumbled, and Dick valiantly tried to save it. Eventually, Dick's horse suffered a severe injury, but he continued to flee on foot. As he rode along the river, his horse stumbled again, and Dick heard the Indians closing in. Despite the challenges, Dick remained determined to outrun his pursuers and reunite with his companions.|"['1.

Dick swiftly rose as the Indians closed in on him, darting like an antelope into dense shrubbery. Although the foliage didn't fully shield him from the chase, it did slow the pursuers down, giving Dick a fighting chance. He reached the edge of a wide river, its fast-flowing waters rushing unimpeded. With a sheer cliff face towering above the riverbank, Dick had limited options. After a brief stand-off with the Indians, he leaped into the river, evading their arrows as he swam downstream. Expert in water skills from his upbringing, Dick navigated the river's dangers with gratitude for his escape. Stranded in the wilderness, miles from civilization, Dick assessed his situation. Despite the dire circumstances, his resilient spirit and survival instincts kicked in. He checked his rifle and ammunition, finding his powder dry and his bullets intact. With a few essential supplies and his mother's Bible for comfort, Dick faced the unknown with determination.|"['1.

In the wilderness, Dick was moved to tears by the unexpected sound of his mother's voice echoing in his mind. He had once viewed religion as somber, but now he found solace in his mother's words. Drying his clothes in the warm sun and breeze, he prepared his rifle and set off into the woods, feeling a sense of lightness despite his heavy heart. Dick, a skilled backwoodsman, knew how to navigate by the sun and stars. Determined to find his companions, he followed their trail, hoping they had escaped danger. As he searched, hunger led him to berries and water. Despite the challenges, Dick found comfort in reading from his mother's Bible, feeling a sense of companionship in his solitude.|"[""1.

Dick's journey took a troublesome turn after losing his pipe in the river. Surprisingly, the absence of tobacco left him craving it more than ever before. This unexpected dependence on the habit cost him precious sleep that night. The text raises a thought-provoking question about creating unnecessary desires and the discomfort they may bring. Dick's search for his companions led him into a barren and confusing landscape, where he struggled to find tracks and sustenance. His desperate quest for food and water led him to the brink of exhaustion and delirium. The narrative describes his hallucinations and moments of lucidity as he battles the harsh environment. Ultimately, Dick finds temporary relief near a stream but faces a new challenge of physical weakness and a looming sense of mortality.|['1.

In his half-asleep state, Crusoe felt an animal's rough coat brush his forehead, fearing wolves. Startled, he was comforted by his loyal dog's affection. Later, Crusoe faced danger from an Indian, dodging arrows and attacking back. Captured, the Indians debated his fate, planning a dog-dance around him. Bound and tied, Crusoe plotted an escape.

On the exact spot, Crusoe rested and slept deeply for four hours. He woke up, gobbled a leftover piece of skin, and sprinted across the prairie to where he had the tussle with the Indian. Reaching the river, he leaped just like his master had and emerged on the other side, higher up. After some searching, he found Dick by a salt creek at dusk. Overwhelmed with joy, Dick embraced Crusoe, shedding tears, laughing, and even fainting. Crusoe, confused by Dick's behavior, howled mournfully, thinking it would help. Later, Crusoe dug frantically in the sand at Dick's command, hoping to find water. When they found a damp spot, Dick drank eagerly, grateful for the brackish water. Crusoe caught a prairie-hen, which Dick drank the blood of before feeding the meat to the dog. Though this tale may seem like fiction, the reality of survival in the wild can lead to desperate measures, even among the most refined individuals.|"[""1.

Poor Dick Varley felt a deep connection with his dog, Crusoe, even though the dog couldn't understand his words. Talking to Crusoe brought Dick comfort in the lonely wilderness. Determined to set up camp, Dick prepared a meal by the stream. He made a canopy from bush branches and lit a fire for cooking. Boiling water and roasting buffalo tongue, he found joy in the simple tasks. The hot syrup with maple sugar tasted better than tea or coffee. Despite his hardships, Dick found happiness in the delicious meal and the company of Crusoe. As they ate together, Dick realized the value of companionship and the joy of sharing a meal with a loyal friend under the stars.|['1.

Dick had set out from his camp a week ago and was now moving quickly towards the Rocky Mountains, closely following the trail of his missing friends. With Crusoe by his side, he easily kept track of the trail. He carried the buffalo hide he had hunted strapped to his back and another animal's skin cut into a long coil around his neck. Crusoe also carried a bundle of meat on each side. Once, a group of mustangs came close to him, startled by his sudden appearance. These wild horses are descendants of the Spanish steeds brought by Cortez to the New World in 1518. The Indians, initially terrified by these creatures, eventually learned to capture them using lassos for hunting and war. Today, the mustangs are vital to the survival of many tribes in the west.|['1.

Dick and Crusoe spotted a herd of mustangs peacefully grazing in a lush green hollow. Excited but cautious, Dick carefully observed the horses and planned his approach. With Crusoe by his side, he crept back to hide from view and then sprinted to a spot where he could conceal himself near the herd. Dick prepared his tools, including a noose and hobbles, to capture one of the magnificent horses, focusing on a dark-brown leader. Taking aim, he fired, causing chaos among the mustangs.

Dick faced a challenging task of taming a wild horse, a mustang. He was familiar with the method used by Indians to break wild horses, but the mustang's strength made it seem impossible. Dick struggled to choke the horse, tire it out, and control it with hobbles and a noose. Despite his efforts, the horse remained untamed. Seeking help from his loyal dog, Crusoe, Dick finally managed to bring the mustang down by tightening the noose. Instead of continuing the exhausting struggle, Dick decided to adopt a new approach. He freed the horse, mounted it, and began a wild ride across the plains. Despite the mustang's frantic attempts to throw him off, Dick held on, displaying remarkable riding skills. The race continued at breakneck speed, with Dick navigating the undulating terrain, showing his determination and courage in the face of the untamed mustang.|"[""1.

As Dick Varley rode his mustang through the dense woodland, he encountered a river ahead. Determined, he urged his horse onward, crossing the river with a daring leap. Safely across, they galloped onto the open plain, but the wild horse showed signs of fatigue. Seizing the opportunity to assert his control, Dick gently guided the horse into a trot and then a walk, soothing it with kind words. After fording the river and passing through the forest, they reached the open prairie, where the mustang regained its spirit. Dick, mindful of the approaching night, calmed the horse and led it back to camp. He cared for the mustang, allowing it to graze before resting himself. Despite his successful taming of the wild horse, Dick experienced discomfort and pain from the arduous journey, a lesson he learned firsthand.|['1.

"Dick approached the wild horse confidently, patting its head and stroking its nose to build trust. He then slowly stroked its back and limbs, circling around it calmly. After offering water and gaining the horse's acceptance, Dick mounted its back despite the initial resistance. The horse galloped, but Dick calmed it with gentle gestures. This process of building trust and familiarity continued, with the dog Crusoe also involved.

Dick followed his lost companions' trail at a fast pace, mindful not to tire his dog and new friend. Each night, he camped under a tree or in the open prairie, securing his horse and resting. Charlie, his new companion, grew comfortable with Dick and his routines. One day, Dick couldn't find wood or water, so he used dried buffalo dung for fuel and a bladder for water. Despite feeling alone when his horse vanished, Charlie adapted and began to feed nearby. The next morning, Dick and Crusoe tried to catch Charlie, who playfully eluded them. Eventually, Dick decided to leave Charlie behind, and as they walked away, Charlie followed, showing his attachment. At a later camp, Dick found a wooden cross marking a grave, stirring deep emotions about the unknown hunter buried there.|"[""1.

In the dark depths of the Rocky Mountains, a young hunter named Dick Varley faced the monstrous grizzly bear, a creature feared by many. With only his faithful companion Crusoe by his side, Dick braced himself for the encounter. The grizzly bear, known for its size and ferocity, hissed at Dick as he stood his ground.

After a fierce encounter with a grizzly bear, Dick found himself in a life-threatening situation. With no time to reload his rifle or escape, he faced a sheer cliff on one side and an impenetrable thicket on the other.

The man, named Walter Cameron, approached Dick Varley, a young hunter from Mustang Valley, seeking guidance through the rugged mountains. Cameron, a fur-trader, led a group on a trapping expedition. Dick, although from the east side of the mountains, was lost. He agreed to guide them as far as he could, then search for his missing comrades. Cameron offered Dick a position as a trapper, but Dick declined, determined to find his friends first. An Indian's sighting of the missing men gave hope.

"Cameron replied to Dick, ""Hold on, let's take care of my people first. But I'll be ready before sunset. Can you lead us to your camp?"" Burning with impatience to help his friends, Dick agreed and guided them to his camp. The fur-traders set up tents, made fires, cooked food, and settled in. The once quiet spot was now bustling with activity, fires, and voices. In the past, fur-trading was done differently, with armed bands venturing into Indian territory.

A tall hunter, resembling Joe Blunt, advised a young man to avoid trouble with Native Americans and alcohol for a bright future. Dick, a seasoned traveler, vouched for his loyal dog, Crusoe. Together with Cameron, they rode through valleys and mountains under the moonlight, following an Indian guide's trail. After two nights and a day's journey, they encountered a group of nine Indians. Cameron, skilled in distinguishing war and hunting arrows, suspected them of being a war party. He confronted them, revealing their true intentions and demanding to be taken to their camp for peaceful negotiations. The Indians, surprised by Cameron's insight, admitted to being warriors but denied knowledge of any white prisoners. Despite the setback, Dick remained hopeful, realizing the Indians might be deceitful about the captives.|['1.

"Cameron whispered to Dick, ""I don't trust what they're saying about your friends. They might be hiding them for ransom or worse. But we'll stop them, don't worry."" The Indians quickly prepared to leave with minimal gear. Within thirty minutes of being discovered, they raced ahead towards the Peigan camp. After a twenty-mile run, they reached a mountain pass with a view of a beautiful valley. In the distance, thin smoke rose above the trees. Despite the large number of Indians, the trappers, armed and fearless, knew they could handle the situation. As they neared the Peigans' camp, the Indians seemed alarmed but regained composure.

"""Joe Blunt!"" exclaimed Dick in utter amazement as Crusoe sniffed around excitedly. But Joe remained bound and silent, his mouth gagged with leather, his body rigidly tied to a pole.

In the past, the trappers had a bold strategy when dealing with the Indians, taking advantage of their superior weaponry. Despite the tense situation, a trapper named Joe sought to mend relations by offering gifts to the Indians as a gesture of peace. This act of generosity surprised the Indians, leading to a mutual exchange of goodwill. The trappers and the Indians parted ways amicably, with the Indians returning to the forest as the trappers rode back to their camp. Following these events, Joe, along with his friends Dick, Henri, and Crusoe, decided to join Walter Cameron's group of trappers. Joe's mission to promote peace among the Indian tribes aligned with the traders' objectives. Dick joined for the adventure and the opportunity to hunt in the Rocky Mountains, while Henri's impulsive nature led him to join the group.

Walter Cameron altered his plan to go east due to a lack of beavers. Instead, he ventured west, exploring the mountains and valleys. This fur-trading expedition was among the first to explore these regions for furs. They wandered, setting traps where beavers were found. Beaver skins were valuable, traded for trinkets from the Indians. Horses were abundant, exchanged for simple items. The trade was fair, as the traders' efforts were significant. The landscape was stunning, with rivers, lakes, and diverse wildlife. Natural wonders like disappearing rivers and natural bridges amazed the trappers. The land provided food and resources, making it a land of wonder and mystery.|['1.

In the wild wilderness, the horse galloped away while the elk trotted swiftly. Bears roamed freely, and the trappers hunted various animals to feed their group. Despite the beauty of the land, dangers lurked, especially from the thieving Indians. Dick, a young and adventurous trapper, reveled in the sights and sounds of nature. The trappers' success in trapping beavers was remarkable, even in strange places like disappearing rivers. The group marched in an organized manner, with hunters leading the way and guards protecting the rear. Joe Blunt excelled as a hunter, while Dick and his horse, Charlie, were always on the move, hunting and exploring. The trappers set up camps strategically, prepared for potential attacks from the lurking savages. This adventure in the wild showcased the beauty and dangers of nature, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and cooperation in the face of adversity.|"[""1.

Trappers were sent out daily in small groups, some by foot and some on horseback, but never more than twenty miles away from camp. Each trapper had ten steel traps to set every night near streams where beavers had cut down trees. Beavers are like giant water-rats with broad, flat tails used for food. They build lodges under riverbanks, damming water to prevent freezing. Trappers would skin the beavers in the morning for their fur and meat. Sometimes trappers had to be cautious of thieves and even murderers. Once, three trappers were killed by a rival tribe while setting traps. Their bodies were found days later by a search party.|['1.

One day Dick Varley rushed back to camp with news about bears nearby. He wanted to wait for more trappers to gather before hunting them. Dick mentioned plans to send a group to explore a valley beyond the Blue Mountains for beavers. He invited others to join, promising bear and even Indian hunting. That evening, a party led by Pierre, a Canadian, left for the Blue Hills, aiming to reconnoiter, not trap. Crusoe and Charlie were part of the group. While ahead, Dick and Crusoe witnessed a fierce fight between a blind wild turkey-cock and a white-headed eagle. As they watched, an arrow narrowly missed Dick, and Crusoe saved an Indian from being strangled. Dick secured the Indian, warning him not to escape, with Crusoe guarding him.|['1.

Dick quickly returned with a piece of leather to bind the Indian's hands behind his back. The Indian eyed his bow nearby, but Crusoe's menacing display of teeth kept him in check. With his hands bound and a noose around his neck, Crusoe led the Indian while Dick followed on horseback. Laughter erupted among the trappers upon seeing the scene. They proposed hanging the Indian as a warning. Dick, determined to save the man, suggested a trial instead. However, the trappers decided to let the horses loose, leading to chaos as the Indians seized them. In the confusion, an Indian tricked Dick and stole a horse.

The trappers returned one by one, tired, angry, and hopeless. They gathered and started blaming each other, leading to fights with bloody outcomes. After supper and a smoke, they slept under the trees until morning. The next day, in a sullen mood, they headed back to camp on foot. Near the camp, wolves had killed seven horses in one night, and another was devoured the following night. The trader set traps to catch the white wolves, which are larger and more solitary than regular wolves. These wolves are strong and fierce, even attacking humans. Their method of killing horses is strategic and brutal. One day, they found a white wolf caught in a trap, looking terrifying with blood on its fur. The men had to shoot it to end its suffering. Meanwhile, another group of trappers encountered seven bears digging for food, leading to a chaotic battle with gunfire and yelling, resulting in casualties among the bears.|"['1.

The horsemen dismounted and rushed into the bushes, finding and killing two bears. The third bear attacked an Iroquois, who was saved by Henri's brave act of stabbing the bear. The trappers, unable to shoot without endangering their friend, fired at the bear's head, saving Henri. The wounded Iroquois survived and recovered. The hunt yielded deer and a buffalo. The Iroquois efficiently butchered the buffalo, using its hoof as a hammer. They ate the raw marrow and liver, a practice some found strange.

Once upon a time, a peculiar man joined Joe and his friend on a journey into the prairies. The man, tall and thin, wore green spectacles and had a penchant for collecting insects. Joe, initially taken aback by the man's odd behavior, soon joined in the collecting frenzy. He crushed beetles and butterflies, filling his pockets with the creatures. The man, unfazed by Joe's method, explained that he collected the insects for observation. Despite this, Joe had a misadventure with the man's revolver, accidentally shooting a charge of insects into a buffalo. The man's revolver, unknowingly used as a makeshift container, had its barrels filled with various items. Eventually, when food was scarce, Joe offered to kill his horse for meat, but the man adamantly refused. Luckily, Joe's friend managed to hunt a wild horse, saving them from starvation.|"['1.

After Joe's tale, they arrived at the camp, finding chaos. Women and children panicked, while few men armed themselves. A cloud of dust signaled mounted Indians approaching. Cameron, with ten men, prepared to confront them. Women and children sought safety within a barricade. Cameron and his men rode out to face the Indians. They discovered only four, driving a herd of horses. Joe and Henri blocked their escape. The Indians fled into the bushes, leaving the horses behind. The trappers drove the horses towards the camp. Not only did they recover their own horses but also seized seventy more from the Indians. These horses were stolen by a band of robbers who were eventually chased by Cameron's men. Cameron then sent a party to search for Pierre and his companions, who were captured by the robbers.|"['1.

Henri started with a burst of energy, showcasing his running and twisting skills for half-an-hour without success. Suddenly, Joe Blunt yelled, freezing Henri in place. In the Rocky Mountains, snow accumulates in winter and avalanches occur when it thaws, carrying debris down steep slopes. An avalanche was imminent, burying Charlie under a snow hill. A grizzly bear dug into the mound, likely to retrieve the horse. The hunters returned to camp, finding Pierre's party disheartened. Upon hearing about the avalanche, they rushed to the gorge. Crusoe led the attack on the bear, and with intense effort, they dug a cavern and found a surprising discovery beyond the snow wall, leaving them astonished.|['1.

Dick and his faithful dog, Crusoe, were out hunting when they heard a distant thunderous sound that soon turned into a roar mixed with wild cries. As they looked on, they saw a herd of buffaloes being driven by a tribe of Indians towards a huge cliff. The buffaloes, terrified and unable to stop, charged towards the edge. Some of them fell over the cliff, crashing to their demise. The Indians, in a frenzy, reveled in the spectacle, their only aim to drive the animals over the precipice for sport. The cliff across from Dick was a massive wedge-shaped promontory, with sheer sides and chaotic rocks scattered around. The Indians, growing in number, worked together to steer the buffaloes towards the cape, where they met their tragic fate. The scene was both thrilling and horrifying, marking a significant turning point in the peaceful valley.|"['1.

The group of front-runners dashed wildly to the cliff's edge. They halted abruptly, staring in horror at the abyss below. In a split second, the force of the herd behind them propelled them over. They plummeted down, a living waterfall, onto the jagged rocks. Some crashed into the rocks during the fall, their bodies shattered, blood spraying. Others leaped from rock to rock, then tumbled headlong. Dick Varley and his dog stood frozen, watching the gruesome scene. Only around fifty of the buffaloes survived the leap, only to face the arrows of the heartless pursuers. Dick had heard of this cruel practice by the Indians but witnessing it filled him with dread. As the noise faded, Dick saw the savages approaching to capture him. He swiftly mounted his horse and raced towards the camp to warn them. Cameron and Joe Blunt swiftly prepared for defense as the Indians closed in.|"[""1.

The creek was crossed in a single leap; the trio of hunters dismounted and advanced energetically, impressing the natives. Cameron seized the moment to suggest a peace talk over a pipe. The Indians agreed, and friendly discussions followed. Despite lengthy speeches and exaggerated compliments, Cameron gifted tobacco and trinkets, signaling his willingness to trade. The next day, the entire tribe arrived, setting up camp opposite the traders. The tribe, consisting of three divisions - the Shirry-dikas, War-are-ree-kas, and Banattees, was formidable. The Shirry-dikas were skilled buffalo hunters, the War-are-ree-kas were fishers, and the Banattees were notorious robbers. The Banattees, especially, were feared for their deceitful tactics. The chiefs expressed interest in peace, but challenges lay ahead, particularly with the Banattees and neighboring hostile tribes like the Peigans and Blackfeet.|['1.

The chiefs were intrigued by the declaration and agreed to make Joe Blunt their deputy to the enemy's court. Cameron then gifted them with red flags and blue surcoats with brass buttons. Pee-eye-em, however, burst his surcoat due to its small size but seemed content. Joe decided to visit the Indian camp for the peace negotiations. Suddenly, a thundering sound was heard, and a herd of wild horses stampeded towards the camp. The camp was thrown into chaos as the horses galloped through, trampling over tents and belongings. Dick and Henri managed to calm down a struggling horse amidst the turmoil. Eventually, the horses calmed down, and the camp was restored to order. Charlie, Dick's horse, broke free and joined the stampede, returning to his wild roots.|"['1.

Dick was surprised when a flood of horses raced past him, but his loyal steed, Crusoe, was among them, happy to be free. Crusoe sensed the approaching horses before they arrived, and when Charlie dashed by with a halter trailing behind him, Crusoe grabbed it with his teeth. Together they galloped off, Crusoe never giving up. As they fell behind, the horses got tangled in underbrush, stopping their wild run. Crusoe's teeth cut the halter, freeing Charlie. Crusoe then led Charlie back to camp. The next day, hunters arrived with plenty of buffalo meat, leading to feasting and joy in the camp. The Indians traded furs with trappers, creating a friendly atmosphere. Joe proposed heading to Mustang Valley with their goods, ready for a new adventure.|"['1.

As Dick and his friends prepared to leave the Indian camp at dawn, the warriors unleashed a powerful war-whoop that echoed through the camp. Despite the cacophony, Crusoe, the loyal dog, remained unfazed, calmly resting by the fire. The group readied themselves for the journey ahead, with Crusoe showing his excitement by frolicking around. As the sun rose over the Rocky Mountains, casting a fiery glow, the companions set off on their horses, bid farewell to the camp, and headed east towards home. Dick, usually brave but now feeling homesick, yearned for the comfort of his cottage and his mother's kindness. Crusoe, sensing his master's emotions, observed and recorded these moments in his memory.

Dick Varley's mood brightened only on their way back home, particularly when they crossed the stunning prairies near the Rocky Mountains. It was then that Dick finally confided in Joe Blunt about his feelings. Joe, a seasoned hunter, shared his own experience with homesickness and how heading back home had always cured it for him. As they conversed, a sudden appearance of a lone horseman alerted them to the presence of Blackfeet Indians. The friends quickly hid behind trees, but the Indians spotted them. Fortunately, the Indians were peaceful and after a friendly exchange, they parted ways on good terms. Subsequent encounters with other Indian bands were also amicable, except for one war party that they managed to evade.|"[""1.

"""I will attempt to negotiate with them,"" stated Joe Blunt; ""but keep a close watch on them, Dick, and if they misbehave, shoot the horse of the leading chief. I will signal with my left hand. Remember, lad, do not harm any human until my second signal, and ensure Henri refrains from action until I return to you."" Saying this, Joe agilely leaped over the small wall of their fort and ran unarmed towards the Indians. In moments, he was amidst them, surrounded. Initially, the savages threatened with spears and yells, trying to intimidate him. However, as Joe stood firm, they ceased and inquired about his presence. As tensions rose, Joe warned, ""The Blackfeet must not move. The first horse that advances will be shot. The second person who steps forward will also meet the same fate.""

"Crusoe responded with a brief, unsure bark before darting away and vanishing behind a small cluster of trees. Shortly after, a mournful howl echoed across the plains, leaving the travelers unsettled. The dog's behavior, combined with its sorrowful cry, evoked a superstitious fear in the group as they exchanged puzzled glances. ""Let's investigate,"" exclaimed Joe Blunt, urging his horse forward. In a few strides, they reached the other side of the knoll, where they stumbled upon a gruesome scene. The ground was littered with the mutilated bodies of around twenty to thirty individuals, scalped and brutally murdered. Most appeared to have been killed in their sleep, while a few seemed to have fought fiercely for their lives. The travelers realized the victims were trappers or hunters, but their identities and intentions remained a mystery. The group suspected the Camanchees, spotted earlier that day, were responsible for the massacre. Despite Joe's desire for retribution, their small party prevented immediate action.

Joe and his companions were being chased by Camanchee Indians when a sudden storm approached. The hunters found shelter behind a rock as the whirlwind swept through the forest, causing chaos and destruction.
