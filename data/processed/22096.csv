In the dark woods, a third tribe of Little People lives underground guarding sacred white buffaloes and keeping serpent monsters at bay. They dance in rings where trees stand alone, ensuring the world stays in balance. Stories are shared in winter when the Little People sleep, for telling tales in summer risks their wrath. One storyteller, nearly turned into an animal for disobeying, was saved by being a White Indian. The old Indian's warning averted disaster, teaching that all must remain true to themselves. The Red Children honor the Great Spirit by cherishing flowers, a reminder of nature's kindness. So, listen to stories in winter, for they hold wisdom and caution for those who hear.|"['1.

In ancient times, Native American tribes had a deep respect for nature and its gifts. They believed that fruits and crops were not only for humans but also for the birds and animals. Before harvesting maple sap, they would offer tobacco and prayers to the Great Spirit, thanking the trees for their service. Planting corn was a sacred event, with prayers for a bountiful harvest. The strawberry was considered a precious gift from the Great Spirit, and its ripening brought joy and gratitude. The Harvest Moon marked a four-day feast where thanks were given for all growing things. Legends spoke of the Spirit of the Corn, a maiden who vowed to protect her fields after a blight.

In ancient times, Native American tribes camped for moons at a time. They only moved if game was scarce or if they didn't like the campsite. The camp was protected by a ring of fires that kept wild animals away. The ability to make fire was highly valued, and the fastest firemaker became a chief. This person was respected for their skill and wisdom. Some chiefs were known as Peacemakers, spreading love and unity among tribes. The Peace fire was tended by a wise woman who ensured it never went out. Nations sought the Peacemaker's consent before going to war, as they promoted peace and understanding. The story of an Oneida and Cayuga chief quarreling but finding peace through the Peacemaker shows the importance of unity and harmony among tribes.|"[""1.

The Oneida chief couldn't forget the lovely woman. After a month, he convinced the Peacemaker to join him at his wigwam. Then, a White man arrived from the east, in a big white-winged canoe. He asked for a small seat, the size of a buffalo skin. The Red Children welcomed him as a brother in the name of the Great Spirit. The White man drove the Indian from east to west. Old Mother Bear cared for a little papoose as her own, raising him alongside her cubs. The boy thought he was a bear and played with them all day.

Once, Mother Bear used her magical powers to protect the boy from the bear hunters. She threw rabbit hairs and partridge feathers to confuse the hunters, but this time, she was worried as the hunters were skilled with four-eyed dogs that could easily track her.

Long ago, a hunter adorned his lodge with wolf, panther, and deer skins. His wife crafted warm coats from fox and beaver skins he brought. However, they never wore bear-skin coats. In the young earth, lacking birds, the Great Spirit from the sky made feathered suits for them. Turkey Buzzard sought the suits, finding many beautiful ones. Reluctantly, he wore the last plain, dull suit with few feathers, cut too low. The Evil Spirit, envious of the beautiful birds, tried to imitate them. People followed strange drumming in the woods, encountering a big bird and smaller birds that startled them with wing drumming.|"[""1.

The elder man trailed behind as they headed to the wigwam village. In front of each wigwam, a skin on a pole marked the clan of the dwellers. The fox instructed them to swim to the river, catch fish by dipping their tails in the water, and wait for a nibble. As the fox led them to the bear, the bear warned the fox to go another way, but the fox pretended not to hear. The dogs pounced on the bear, causing a struggle until the bear broke free from the ice. The bear swiped at the dogs, who then chased the fox. The eagle, the Chief of Birds, declared his intention to fly the Great Sky Trail. The thrush cleverly hid on the eagle's back, and together they soared high into the sky along the Great Sky Trail. Finally, the birds carried the Sky Mother to an island on the turtle's back, where she heard voices beneath her heart, one gentle and loving, the other harsh and quarrelsome.|"['1.

Long ago, the Sky Mother gazed upon her twin sons, the spirits of Good and Evil. She named the Good Mind the Light One. The Light One grew up kind and loving, creating beautiful mountains and forests, while the Dark One, his brother, brought darkness and destruction to the land. In a village, Spread Feather, a proud Indian boy, thought he was the best at everything. He was lazy and refused to hunt, neglecting his son's hunger. One day, the boy vanished, leaving behind a lonely bird. This bird laid its eggs carelessly, unlike other birds that built safe nests.

Not long after, the raccoon spotted the fox approaching along the path. The raccoon was enjoying some delicious yellow apples he had discovered on a nearby tree. Upon seeing the fox, he quickly scurried up a tree and began smacking his lips, imitating the fox's actions to lure the bear. The raccoon then shared directions with the fox on how to locate the apple tree. Following the trail by the river to the pine bluff, then climbing the bluff and running towards the setting sun would lead to a field with a magnificent apple tree filled with juicy yellow apples. The raccoon advised the fox to back off a certain distance from the tree, lower his head, and charge at it to make the apples fall. The fox followed the raccoon's instructions but ended up with a sore head from the impact, remembering the raccoon's earlier trick. As the fox chased the raccoon, they reached a tall pine tree where the fox decided to rest.

Once upon a time, a clever fox decided to paint the dark little birds with the color of the sun. Using yellow flowers as his paint, he began to create beautiful works of art. However, the birds were so joyful and light-hearted that they couldn't wait for the fox to finish. Meanwhile, in the forest, the trees grew strong and proud, each boasting of its own greatness.

Once upon a time, a bird flew into a wigwam and up the chimney, leaving black streaks on the woodpecker's back. The tribe living there destroyed forests, plants, and animals needlessly.

Once upon a time, as darkness covered the land, a council of mice gathered under the moonlight. The wise leader reminded them that strength is not for fighting but for protecting the weak. The mice decided to disarm the fierce warriors by destroying their weapons before the moon rose. With swift precision, they snapped bowstrings and cut sling shot cords, rendering the weapons useless. As the warriors slept, the mice accomplished their mission. A crow named _Ga gaah_ shared a tale of bringing corn to the Red Children, teaching the importance of sharing and planning ahead.

In the spring, the crows forget their winter hunger when the skies turn blue and the sun shines warmly. They gather in the tree, forgetting about the future, focusing only on the present plenty of corn.

The dogs sadly expressed that without the ability to talk, they would still be loyal friends and protectors. They vowed to always support and fight for their human companions when needed. It is believed that in the afterlife, the souls of kind individuals are aided by two dogs guarding a river. These dogs allow good souls to cross on a log due to their kindness to animals. Conversely, souls of those who mistreated animals are denied passage. In a wigwam, Deerheart, Sky Elk, and their son Greedy Fawn lived. Greedy Fawn lived up to his name when he tried to cook chestnut porridge. He stirred the pot vigorously as the porridge swelled, fearing it would overflow.|['1.

Greedy Fawn couldn't reach the porridge in the kettle, so he ran around it, stirring and stirring. The kettle grew so large it filled the wigwam, leaving only enough space for him to run around it. Eventually, exhausted, he fell by the kettle, unable to rise. The porridge boiled over, nearly burying Greedy Fawn. Meanwhile, wolves and panthers, unable to catch a bull, decided to pursue a hound. The bull warned the hound of the danger, and they sought refuge in a pine forest. The hound marked time on a stick, waiting for help.

Once upon a time, a hungry hare found himself stuck at the top of a willow tree. He pondered how long he could survive without food.
