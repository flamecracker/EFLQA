Tom decided to seek out the mechanic to gather more information about the mysterious men. The mechanic revealed that the men came from Shopton and owned a fireworks factory that had burned down. They identified themselves as Field and Melling. Tom learned that they were planning to overhaul their car and were involved in a new business venture. Upon reaching the stranded airship Scud, Tom's suspicions about Field and Melling grew. He believed Josephus Baxter had been deceived in a deal with them.

Tom Swift carefully examined the chemical compound he had created. He ensured it was potent and had set up a strong fire for the test to be challenging. Tom's friends, Ned and Tom, watched eagerly through the smoke as the real test began. Would the fire be extinguished by the chemicals' fumes, or would it persist? The fire initially dwindled after a burst of flames from the bomb, but then unexpectedly reignited. Tom suspected that oil had pooled, causing the resurgence. Quickly, he directed his assistant to drop another bomb, which successfully quenched the flames. Despite the success, Tom sought a faster solution.

Tom was prepared with a small hand extinguisher he had made using chemicals of his own. He aimed to sell a larger version for homes once he was done with his airship invention. Without a word, Tom approached the blazing car and used his extinguisher to put out the fire efficiently. The car was damaged but salvageable. Tom revealed his identity and mentioned Josephus Baxter's help in perfecting the extinguisher. The men thanked Tom and expressed interest in buying the extinguisher's formula for their dye business. Tom declined, stating it was not for sale. Later, Tom visited a candy machine owner and then helped with his extinguisher.

Tom Swift, the young inventor, had created an aerial fire-fighting machine that dropped powerful chemicals to extinguish fires. As he directed his craft to a small isolated fire in a lumberyard, he tested his new chemical mixture. The first attempt was not successful due to a lack of carbon dioxide. Tom then released a different mixture that effectively subdued the flames. The crowd cheered as they witnessed the success of Tom's invention. The generated gases blanketed the fire, causing it to die down completely. Tom's chemicals were safe for humans and effectively put out the fire without harm.
