"A hero, whether human or animal, possesses exceptional abilities and accomplishments that captivate the hearts and minds of those who hear their stories. This volume features tales of remarkable animal heroes, each inspired by the real-life adventures of these extraordinary creatures. One such story is that of the White Reindeer, set in Norway in 1900. Another hero, the 'Jack Warhorse,' earned his crown less than a decade ago with his impressive feats. The nest of the Peregrine Falcons, along with their offspring, can now be found in the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The meat-man in Scrimper's Alley attracts a crowd of cats with his calls of ""Meat! Meat!"" as he distributes pieces of boiled liver to the eager felines. Each cat, known by name, receives its share, with some getting extra treats based on their owners' generosity or payment history. Despite the familiar faces, one black cat with a white nose is rejected, as her owner has fallen behind on payments. The meat-man's memory keeps track of each cat's status, even when their owners fall short."|"[""1.

In the city, a group of Cats gathered around a food cart, eagerly awaiting their turn to grab a meal. Among them was a thin gray Cat, known as a Slummer, who lived a tough life on the streets. She patiently watched as other Cats got their share of food until a big Tom Cat tried to steal from a smaller Cat. In the chaos that ensued, the Slummer seized the opportunity to grab the dropped meat and quickly disappeared. She enjoyed her meal in peace before heading back to her family in a nearby rubbish yard. However, one day, tragedy struck when a large Black Tom-cat threatened her family.

"""We need a pedigree, you know,"" Sam declared. A detailed fake pedigree was crafted for the Cat. One gloomy day, Sam, wearing a borrowed silk hat, brought the Cat and the pedigree to the show entrance. A man of African descent welcomed them. He had once been a barber on Sixth Avenue and could exude more grandeur and dignity in five minutes than Jap Malee could in a lifetime. This likely explained the respectful reception given to the Royal Analostan at the Cat Show. Jap felt immense pride being an exhibitor but also held a Cockney's respect for the upper class. Overwhelmed by the carriages and silk hats at the show, he timidly explored the rows of cages, admiring the prize-winning Cats. However, he couldn't find his Slum Kitty. As he navigated the crowded aisles, he stumbled upon the prized Royal Analostan, displayed in a gilded cage, surrounded by guards.

"In a trial flight from Elizabeth, only forty birds returned. This is a common occurrence. Some birds were weak and left behind, while others were foolish and strayed. Through this process of flight selection, pigeon-owners enhance their stock. Ten birds were sent out, five never returned, but five straggled back later that day. The last to arrive was a large Blue Pigeon nicknamed ""Corner-box."" Despite his size and early vigor, some doubted his abilities due to his build. The training continued daily, increasing the distance from home to test the birds' skills. The flock dwindled to twenty, with only the finest birds remaining, like little Arnaux, who displayed exceptional abilities.

In the wilderness, the Wolf communicates through three distinctive calls: the long, deep howl; the muster signaling game too strong to tackle alone; and the ululation of the pack on a hot trail. Amidst our ride through the Badland Buttes, King and I, with a pack of hunting Dogs, a haunting cry pierced the night, a melody with a spine-chilling undertone. The Wolf-hunter identified it as Badlands Billy, out for his prey. In the past, Wolves followed Buffalo herds until their extinction, leading to a wolf-war. Ranchers offered bounties for Wolf pelts, creating wolvers like King Ryder, who possessed a unique understanding of animal behavior.

At dawn, as we prepared to leave camp, three riders arrived - the Penroof boys. The weather change had brought them back, hopeful for snow. King led the Dogs towards a distant figure on a hill, finding fresh Wolf tracks. Excitement filled our hearts as we followed the trail, uncovering the Wolf's nightly activities. The rough ride continued, tracking the Wolves' movements. The pack stayed close, chasing the Wolves through challenging terrain. The chase led us to a valley where the Wolves scattered, dividing the pack. King knew the Wolves were under pressure. Despite challenges in tracking, the Dogs ran fast, indicating a challenging hunt ahead.|"['1.

In the wilderness, a brave old Wolf faced danger to help a friend in need. Despite the Dogs' fierce pursuit, the Wolf showed courage and loyalty by refusing to abandon his companion. The chase led through snow-covered highlands, with the pack split and the Horses galloping eagerly. Eventually, the relentless pursuit brought them face to face with the majestic Big Black Wolf of Sentinel Butte. The scene was intense as the Dogs closed in, the Greyhounds yelping, and the Horses spurred on by the thrill of the chase. The wolvers were ready to take down the Wolf, but he eluded them skillfully.

We hurried along the edge, eager to witness the spectacle. The Dogs came into view on the far side, not in a group, but in a long, scattered line. In a few minutes, they reached the edge, followed by the imposing Black Wolf. Although he displayed power in every movement, his leaps seemed shorter, lacking their usual vigor. As the Dogs caught sight of him and weakly cried out, the Greyhounds, abandoning us, dashed down the canyon in a reckless pursuit. Unable to follow, we watched as the exhausted pack slowly advanced, with the Wolf trailing behind. Despite his efforts, the Wolf was fatigued, while the Dogs, though weary, pressed on.

A boy, barely fifteen, keen on sport, was out hunting Wild Pigeons near a forest clearing. Despite his efforts, the pigeons always flew away before he could shoot. Finally, he managed to take down one bird near a spring, only to realize that both he and another young man had shot at the same pigeon. They laughed about the situation, aware that food and ammunition were scarce in the backwoods. The young man, Corney, led the way to his log cabin where his family lived. The Colt family, known for their Irish-Canadian spirit, found humor in their rough lifestyle. Corney's sisters, Margat and Loo, were managing the household. Thorburn Alder, recovering from an illness, was staying with them to regain his strength. Their simple home, made of logs and sods, was surrounded by the wilderness, with only a rough road leading to the nearby village of Petersay.|"['1.

Their daily routine remained largely unchanged. Corney would rise early to start the fire, wake his sisters, and tend to the horses while they prepared breakfast. By six, breakfast was finished, and Corney would head to work. At noon, signaled by a shadow falling on a spring, Loo would hang a white rag to signal Corney to return for fresh water. At night, they would gather for a simple meal of pork, bread, potatoes, and tea. Thor might be away during the day but would join them for supper. A large basswood tree had fallen, creating a perfect shelter for a mother Lynx in need. Despite hard times, she struggled to find food, resorting to catching a Red-squirrel and even facing a Porcupine. One day, she discovered an abundance of colorful birds near large beaver houses, sparking her hunting instincts. She stealthily stalked her prey, determined to secure a meal.|['1.

Once the Lynx sensed the Partridges' peril, her huntress heart beat with eagerness. She focused on a white bird among the weeds. As she crept closer, her limbs tingled with the scent of life. With a swift leap, she caught the white bird, swift and deadly. Joyful, she bounded home with her prey. Suddenly, a Boy appeared, and the Lynx, wary of humans, growled a warning. She carried her catch to safety, where her young ones awaited a feast. Thor, a town boy turned woodsman, honed his skills with a rifle. He aimed at a Woodchuck, but it was Corney who made the shot.

Thor was out hunting one day when he encountered a large Porcupine in a tree. Thinking it was a Bear cub, he shot it, only to realize it was a harmless Porcupine.

During a rainy summer, a young hunter followed fresh piglike footprints in the soft ground. Tracking them to an open ravine, he spotted a Deer and a spotted Fawn. Startled, he watched in awe as the mother signaled danger and bounded away with her young. Later, he tried to lure the Deer back with a Fawn cry but couldn't bring himself to harm her. The hunter also encountered Lynx kittens playing innocently before facing the fierce old Lynx protecting her kill. Back at the shanty, the hunter's companion fell ill with chills and fever, treated with pipsissewa tea.

He decided to return home during a brief respite from his illness, instructing the girls to use the canoe if they ran out of supplies.

For three long weeks, a dreadful situation unfolded. The suffering continued, growing worse each day. The Boy's strength dwindled, and soon he could not even rise from his bed. One morning, in the dim light, a strange noise startled him awake. To his horror, he saw two fierce eyes staring at him as a large Beast drank from a bucket nearby. Thor was petrified, thinking it was a nightmare with a Tiger in his room. The creature then vanished under the hut, leaving Thor shaken and fearful. The night passed fitfully, with Thor on edge, fearing the return of the mysterious Beast. The next day, they found themselves with little food, sharing what little they had. Thor prepared for the worst, expecting the Beast to return. He armed himself with a makeshift weapon, ready to defend against the hungry intruder.

In a small shanty, Thor faced a terrifying Beast. With a feeble spear as his only defense, he braced for a fight for his life. The Beast, with glowing eyes and a growling demeanor, crouched ready to attack. Thor, weak but determined, mustered all his strength and lunged at the creature. A fierce struggle ensued as the Beast closed in on him, its claws and teeth threatening. With a final effort, Thor pushed harder, and the Beast, with a snarl, fled through a hole in the wall, never to return. Moments later, Corney, a familiar face, arrived, shocked by the scene.

In the countryside, there was a Dog on each farm, but the Warhorse feared a fierce, black Dog the most. This Dog was swift and persistent, almost pushing the Warhorse to his limits. The Warhorse wasn't bothered much by town Cats except for one large Tom-cat that once approached him under the moonlight. The Warhorse faced the Cat bravely, using his hind legs to spring forward and scare the Cat away. However, not all encounters ended well. Once, he had to flee from a mother Cat protecting her Kittens, and another time he mistakenly landed on a Skunk.

Why would a frightened rabbit reveal itself by showing its black-and-white spots while escaping predators instead of hiding? The reason is simple: it's a clever survival strategy. If the threat is just another rabbit, the distinct markings signal that it's a harmless Jack-rabbit, preventing any unnecessary chase. However, if it's a Coyote or Fox, they recognize the Jack-rabbit and give up the pursuit, knowing they can't catch it. The national colors act as a protective shield, saving the Jack from unnecessary stress and running. These unique spots are like a uniform, a flag that signals safety to fellow rabbits and caution to predators. In a town like Newchusen, where dangers lurk everywhere, even in a melon-patch, Jack's quick thinking and adaptability help him navigate through perils and pleasures, always finding a way to outsmart his foes and find refuge in his familiar territory.|"['1.

In the town, the buildings were considered ugly and temporary, with residents planning to move out after a year. The only beauty was found in the hand-planted shade trees and the grain elevator. The vast prairie beyond the town offered a more appealing sight with farmhouses, windmills, and Osage-orange hedges. A traveler, eager to explore, was directed to the prairie by a young boy who spoke of a mysterious creature living near the melon patch. The creature, known as the Little Warhorse, was a Jack-rabbit with unique traits, including a long tail that left distinctive marks in the snow as he fled from the approaching traveler. The Warhorse's quick observations and swift escape tactics showed his intelligence and survival instincts.|"['1.

The rabbit, Jack, was on the run with a man on his trail. Using his instincts, Jack cleverly outwitted his pursuer by doubling back on his trail and making sharp turns to confuse him. He even used a hen-hole in a fence to evade capture. However, his luck almost ran out when a rooster's loud cackle drew attention to him in a yard where a dog was sleeping. Fortunately, the cat's distraction of the dog allowed Jack to escape unseen. As Jack fled to safety, the man following him arrived, armed only with a stick that kept the dog at bay.

The following day, the stranger embarked on another quest for the Jack-rabbit and discovered not only his own tracks but also the tracks of a smaller Rabbit. They met at various spots, playing, feeding, and enjoying the sun together, indicating the mating season. The summer brought an abundance of Jack-rabbits due to a law that led to a decline in Hawks and Owls, prompting a Rabbit drive. The community gathered armed with sticks and stones to corral the Rabbits. The drive commenced with a deafening noise to disorient the sensitive Rabbits. As the drive progressed, the Rabbits were herded into a corral, with many being captured. Among them was the Little Warhorse, who was selected to be spared due to his health. The corral was filled with thousands of Rabbits, some of which were unhealthy, highlighting the harsh reality of wildlife survival.|['1.

I had a new friend named Snap, a unique dog with no fear and a lot of energy. Snap didn't like it when I moved my feet and would snap at them fiercely. But over time, we became good friends, and he even slept on my bed. Snap was so brave that he would stand up to bigger dogs without any fear. Once, he even broke his leg trying to fight a large St. Bernard. Snap was different from other dogs; he never ran away from danger but faced it head-on. Despite his daring nature, he was respected by all. Snap and I shared a special bond, and I valued our friendship greatly. Eventually, I had to leave Snap with the landlady, which led to unfortunate issues.

Despite the Wolf's fierce nature towards men and Dogs, it showed a soft spot for Jim and other children. Meanwhile, ranchers faced Wolf attacks on their livestock, prompting a German visitor to offer two powerful Wolfhounds to help.

A hunt was organized along the Assiniboine for a Gray-wolf, but after three days of searching, they found Hogan's Wolf chained up at the saloon. The Wolf was put in a box, taken to the prairie, and released for the Dogs to chase. The Dogs, eager for the chase, were held back until the Wolf was let loose. The chase began, and the Dogs quickly gained on the Wolf. Despite the Wolf's attempts to escape, the Dogs were much faster. The young Wolf was no match for the Dogs, and after a brief scuffle, the Dogs emerged victorious.

The Factor was very upset about the situation. It could mean losing his Dogs. He didn't believe the report and decided to investigate the evidence himself. Renaud accompanied him. They found a large track on the riverbank, showing a Wolf following the Dogs. The track led them to where the Wolf attacked the sled, causing chaos. The Dogs fought back, and the Wolf was eventually driven off. Renaud realized the Wolf was protecting his daughter from a man named Paul. This incident led to a big hunt on Christmas Day, with many Dogs joining to track down the Winnipeg Wolf.

Away they went, a group of Dogs, a diverse group of horsemen, a crowd of men and boys on foot. Garou was unafraid of the Dogs, but he was wary of the armed men who posed a real threat. He tried to escape into the dark woods but was forced back by the horsemen. Dodging bullets, he ran through the Colony Creek hollow, evading the horsemen temporarily. Garou managed to shake off the horsemen by crossing a barb-wire fence, but he still had to dodge the bullets in the hollow. The Dogs were closing in on him, but none dared to attack. A lanky Hound tried to keep up but was swiftly taken down by Garou. As the chase led toward town, more men and Dogs joined in. Garou sought refuge at a slaughterhouse, where the proximity of houses and more Dogs prevented further shooting. Surrounded by his foes, he made a final stand on a wooden foot-bridge, facing them with unwavering resolve.

The Wolf vanished after the Grammar School burned down, but the sexton of St. Boniface Church claims that on Christmas Eve, the tolling bell can still evoke a haunting Wolf-cry from the nearby graveyard where Little Jim lies. Utrovand, a cold glacial lake in Norway, is surrounded by stunted trees and rocky hills. Beyond this tree line, only moss and rocks thrive due to the harsh cold. The area is devoid of birds and life, covered in gray-green reindeer-moss, orange polytrichum, and lichens. The rocks retain heat, allowing some plants to survive. The snow is melting, feeding icy streams that flow into the lake. The barren landscape between the timber-line and snow-line is known as the Tundra, home to reindeer and reindeer-moss. Legends speak of a Water-fairy or Waterfall Bird that inhabited the area before humans settled there, singing songs and performing mysterious acts.|"[""1.

Man is often blind to the true nature of others, but Fossekal was different. He sang songs filled with humor and foresight, never causing harm. Perched atop the tassel-birch, he observed the Vand-dam stream winding its way to Utrovand. The arrival of spring brought life to the valleys, with birds returning and Reindeer venturing back to the uplands. Despite the Frost Giants' resistance, the Sun's warmth prevailed, pushing them back to Jotunheim. The Reindeer, led by a majestic Hind, grazed peacefully, each finding their spot in the band.

Filled with rage, the White Calf also charged, leaving his adversary wounded. The mysterious Fossekal, a creature like no other, was said to have flown through streams and vanished.

Even the skilled Borgrevinck couldn't help but admire the majestic horse that had thwarted him the night before and was now aiding his journey. He aimed to reach his destination well ahead of the horse-drawn sleigh if possible. Racing up the incline, they seemed to fly downhill, lifting the driver's spirits with their exhilarating pace.
