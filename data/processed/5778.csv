Herbert, a handsome and well-liked fourteen-year-old boy, lived in a quiet village. He had always helped his mother until her passing, and now deeply mourned her loss. His father, who had faced business failure in New York, moved them to the village where they lived off a small income from a farm. Herbert's father, a well-educated man, had personally overseen his son's education until his own death. Herbert's knowledge of Latin and French made him stand out among his peers. Despite his academic achievements, Herbert also excelled in sports. His future was uncertain after his uncle, Benjamin, suggested Herbert should work to support himself.

"Dr. Kent paced the room, considering Herbert's feelings, but knowing it wasn't wise to indulge them. Herbert, in about half an hour, submitted a note to the doctor. It took him some thought to express himself, but he managed it satisfactorily. The letter began, ""UNCLE BENJAMIN: Dr. Kent showed me your reply. I don't seek support, just your influence to help me find a job in the city. I'll accept the ten dollars as a loan and repay it with interest."" Herbert expressed gratitude towards Dr. Kent for his kindness. The doctor emphasized that Herbert could repay him by growing into a good person. Dr. Kent encouraged Herbert to leave a positive impact on the world, regardless of the size of his achievements. Herbert's uncle, upon receiving the letter, felt a mixture of shame and relief.

In the middle of the road, the ground was better than the sides that were sloping with gullies from recent rains. The road was narrow, allowing just two vehicles to pass if they moved to the side. As a man in a buggy approached, Herbert veered to the side but the man didn't. The man angrily demanded more room, but Herbert stood his ground calmly. The man threatened with a whip, but Herbert stood firm. When the man whipped his horse, causing a collision, his buggy broke while Herbert's wagon remained unharmed. Despite the man's embarrassment at being bested by a younger boy, Herbert continued on his way to the mill.|"['1.

No one feels dignified when picking themselves out of a mud puddle. Our black-haired acquaintance was no exception. He shook his fist at the wagon that caused the incident. Mr. Abner Holden then assessed the damage to his buggy, realizing the expenses it would entail. He needed to figure out how to get it back to the stable and continue his journey on foot if he couldn't find another vehicle. Frustrated by the encounter with the wagon, Mr. Holden's temper flared. Another man, disgusted by Mr. Holden's attitude, pointed out that there wasn't enough room to avoid the collision. Despite the inconvenience, Mr. Holden saw an opportunity to have Herbert, a capable boy, work for him.

Mr. Holden walked through a mowing-field and over a stone wall to reach the three-acre lot where the captain oversaw hired men. The captain, with his coat off, seemed to have been helping them. He mentioned that the boy they were discussing was a good lad, the only son of a widowed mother. The boy was smart and capable, with a good education. Holden agreed to support the boy's schooling for two years, providing board, clothes, and a future reward. Herbert, after a clash with a traveler, rushed to the mill to make up for lost time. He then visited a dry-goods store to inquire about job opportunities. Encouraged by the storekeeper's kindness, Herbert left feeling hopeful. He later returned to the mill, delivering grain before heading back home through the fields.|"['1.

Herbert pondered more on his reluctance to live with Mr. Holden. Could he avoid it? He decided to try and shared Mr. Keyes' promise with the doctor and Captain Ross. Mr. Holden, mentioning Herbert working at his store, dismissed the idea of letting him go. Herbert felt uneasy about living with Mr. Holden due to his demeanor and appearance. As Herbert woke early the next day, the thought of leaving Waverley under unfavorable circumstances saddened him. Despite his gloom, he enjoyed a hearty breakfast. Mr. Holden's unpleasant behavior continued, irking the doctor's wife. Before leaving, the doctor handed Herbert an envelope. Riding away, Herbert felt a mix of emotions, laughing at the thought of being Mr. Holden's favorite.

Herbert was determined to follow the advice he had read, despite Mr. Holden's schemes to take advantage of him. Mr. Holden noticed a banknote in Herbert's possession and wanted it for himself to control him better. He planned to use the money for his own benefit, even though he had agreed to provide Herbert with clothing. When they reached a tavern, Mr. Holden expected Herbert to pay for their meal, showing his true colors. Herbert, aware of Mr. Holden's intentions, decided to stand his ground. He paid for their dinner using his own money, which he had received from Dr. Kent and his uncle.

Herbert sat down to a meal of beefsteak, coffee, and apple pie. Despite his hunger, Abner Holden, a fast eater, managed to consume most of the food. Herbert, determined not to be anyone's slave, decided to give Mr. Holden a chance but vowed not to tolerate tyranny. The house they entered was in need of repair, much like its owner. The housekeeper, a pleasant woman, impressed Herbert. They climbed to a garret, a dark and bare space with a cot bed. Mr. Holden was eager to put Herbert to work, and after two hours of labor, Herbert enjoyed a simple but satisfying supper. Mrs. Bickford, the housekeeper, observed Herbert's appetite approvingly.

Abner Holden frowned, but neither Herbert nor the housekeeper paid much attention. The housekeeper was surprised by Abner's behavior as he had never interfered with Herbert's tea or coffee before. Mr. Holden disliked Herbert and acted like a petty tyrant towards him. He hadn't forgotten Herbert's defiance or refusal to give him money. Feeling tired, Herbert went to his room, took out his money, locked it in his trunk, and hid the key. This caution was wise as Mr. Holden later tried to take the money while Herbert slept. Herbert, aware of Mr. Holden's intentions, kept the money close and even hid a fish horn under his pillow for protection.

Around eleven o'clock, Abner Holden, before retiring for the night, decided to try once more to get Herbert's money. He thought that Herbert might have forgotten to put it away this time. Abner wanted to take the money before Herbert spent any of it since boys tend to spend money quickly. He placed the candle on a chair and checked Herbert's pocketbook again, but it was empty. However, he found a key in it, thinking it was for Herbert's trunk. When he tried to use the key on the trunk, the candle went out, and a loud noise scared him. Abner, not very brave and feeling guilty, hurried down the stairs. Abner had some land but only farmed enough for himself and had some animals. He once got tricked into owning a horse with one eye and a bad temper, intending to trade it.|"[""1.

Abner Holden was eager to strike a bargain, hoping to sell his horse Spitfire for a hefty sum. Fearing he had lost the deal, he rushed to the tavern. Despite the disappointment, he was willing to lower the price. His frustration peaked when the trade fell through due to Herbert's interference. Enraged, Abner grabbed a broom, causing chaos in the kitchen. Herbert escaped, running through the fields. The visitor, unimpressed by Abner's actions, hinted at the brutality of using a broom as a weapon. Abner, though tempted to retaliate, held back.

His sudden departure was driven by the need to escape his employer's anger. Initially, he thought he was being chased but, after running a short distance, he found no one following. Out of breath, he rested by a stone wall, pondering his future. The only certainty was that he wouldn't return to Mr. Holden. The idea of enduring Abner's violence was unbearable.

After catching his breath, Herbert stood up and ventured into the nearby woods. It didn't take long for him to find himself surrounded by the dense trees. Pushing through the tangled branches, he finally arrived at a small clearing, about an acre wide. In the center stood a simple hut made of logs and tree branches. Sitting in front of the hut on a tree stump was a tall man with a rugged appearance, dressed in hunting attire. Despite his rough exterior, Herbert recognized him as Ralph the Ranger, a recluse who lived in the forest. Ralph, puffing on a pipe, shared some wisdom with Herbert, advising him to steer clear of a man named Abner Holden. Ralph, who had distanced himself from society, offered to be Herbert's friend, a gesture he hadn't made in years. Herbert found solace in Ralph's words and trusted him as a newfound ally in the wilderness.|"['1.

Herbert stepped into the cabin. The table was a simple plank on two barrels. Ralph took out corn-bread and cold meat from a box. He fetched water from a nearby brook in a tin measure and placed it on the table. Hungry from a day of hard work since his early breakfast at six, Herbert ate heartily. Ralph, grateful for the company, shared his thoughts on solitude. Herbert, enjoying the tranquility of nature, found solace in the company of squirrels and singing birds. As the day passed, Herbert gathered nuts and returned to the cabin. Ralph suggested resting before their trip to Holden's place at midnight. With Ralph's guidance, Herbert left the woods swiftly to avoid a confrontation with Abner Holden, who preferred having Herbert under his control.|"['1.

When night fell and Herbert didn't return, Abner decided to search for him the next day. He kept his plan secret from Mrs. Bickford, knowing she favored Herbert. After breakfast, he told her to let Herbert know to finish the garden work if he returned. Abner suspected Herbert was hiding in the woods, a logical refuge. He set off to search there first. Meanwhile, Herbert stayed back, cautious of his clothes. With little to do in the cabin, he observed wildlife outside. His curiosity led him to climb a tall tree where he found a bird's nest. Unbeknownst to him, Mr. Holden arrived at the cabin, catching Abner's attention with the noise Herbert made. Abner spotted Herbert in the tree, sparking his interest.|"['1.

"Abner, taken aback by Ralph's boldness, had expected fear and pleas for forgiveness. ""I admire your honesty,"" Abner said, preparing to climb up in anger. Despite his lack of climbing experience, fueled by anger, he ascended halfway, causing unease for Herbert, fearing Abner's capture. However, Abner's triumph was short-lived. Slipping at a height of twelve feet, he fell to the ground, tearing his coat and blistering his hands. As Abner tried to execute his threat with a pistol, a sudden blow disarmed him. While Ralph engaged Abner in conversation, Abner maneuvered to retrieve the pistol. Seizing the weapon, he threatened them both.

Ralph, determined to help the boy escape from Abner Holden, took action. He warned Abner of the temporary inconvenience he would face. Despite being tied up, Abner knew he couldn't resist Ralph's resolve. Herbert, witnessing the scene, remained brave and did not interfere. Alone in Ralph's cabin, Abner realized his plans had failed. The dog sensed Abner's helplessness and barked menacingly. Abner, though a bully, was easily frightened, especially by the fierce dog. As the dog growled, Abner tried to defend himself with an axe.

If Oscar had been wise, he might have thought twice before acting on his threat. A quick look at the two boys would have shown that Herbert had the upper hand in a physical fight. Herbert was slightly taller than Oscar and had a stronger, more muscular build due to his previous physical work. This fact fueled Oscar's determination to defeat Herbert.

Herbert was in disbelief. He disliked thinking poorly of others and hoped for a different explanation. Perhaps Greenleaf took his money as a prank and was waiting downstairs to laugh at Herbert's reaction. Desperate for hope, Herbert considered this possibility. Suddenly, he remembered changing a five-dollar bill for supper and keeping the change in his vest pocket. Relieved, he found the money untouched. However, he was left with only four dollars after paying for another day at the hotel, knowing it would diminish further with breakfast expenses. Hungry and with limited funds, he remembered a letter from Mr. Carroll, praising his bravery and recommending him for a job. Despite the setback, Herbert felt hopeful about his future job prospects.

Herbert, a country boy seeking work in the city, felt a mix of nerves and hope as he made his way to his potential job. Walking through the bustling Broadway, he marveled at the busy crowds and endless flow of vehicles, finding courage in the vibrant scene. Eventually, he located the building on Pearl Street where he hoped to find work. Inside, he met Mr. Pratt, a somber bookkeeper, and a well-dressed boy his age. Herbert's spirits sank, realizing he had to wait two days to see Mr. Godfrey, uncertain of his financial situation.

Herbert felt angry and cheated when he realized he had been robbed by Greenleaf. He couldn't afford to stay at his current hotel anymore. So, he decided to look for a cheaper place to stay. After some thought, he found a rundown boarding house on Stanton Street. Though the place was shabby, he couldn't be picky due to his financial situation. With only two dollars and a half left, he had to budget carefully. He planned to buy a five-cent loaf of bread to last him through the day.

Herbert pondered, recalling his struggles in the West while his well-off uncle refrained from helping. Across the street, he gazed at his uncle's house. A boy, likely his cousin, entered.

"""No,"" Tom said reluctantly. ""I suppose he'll pass; but he's countrified.

""Thomas will do no such thing!"" said Mrs. Stanton, decidedly. ""It's my opinion that the less notice we take of him the better.
