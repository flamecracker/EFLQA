Tom Betts pointed excitedly at a figure scurrying away near a pile of lumber.

Inside, they observed three large boxes securely fastened with wire and nails. Jack proposed hiring Hans as a permanent night watchman due to the increasing number of tramps passing by.

Jack instructed Hans to keep the key to the storage room where valuable cases were stored for his father's friend. The cases were to be protected as someone seemed interested in them.

As the meeting progressed, excitement grew among the scouts. Paul, after ensuring there was no other business, announced a special offer. Two town gentlemen offered their motorboats for a cruise during the vacation. The boys cheered, eager to accept. Paul shared a plan to navigate the motorboats up the Radway River. Some scouts doubted the plan due to the distance and obstacles. Paul explained using an old canal, Jackson Creek, to connect the two rivers.

Several boys felt sad because they wanted to join the troop on a cruise up the Radway, but their families had planned a trip to the sea-shore. Paul counted about eighteen boys who might go, with the possibility of two more joining. They planned to leave early on Wednesday and meet at noon the next day to prepare. Paul mentioned the challenge of sleeping on the small boats but hoped to reach Cedar Island by night. Curly Baxter was nervous about spending the night on Cedar Island.

By midday, the entire town was aware of the upcoming cruise. Boys not part of Stanhope Troop grew excited and envious of their peers. The assistant scout master could have formed two more patrols from eager volunteers, but Paul, wise in his choices, believed in selecting boys who could uphold the scout principles. Some scouts were surprised by a visit from old Peleg Growdy, initially seen as a grumpy man. Despite a past grievance, Paul suggested helping Peleg clean his yard to mend relations. Peleg, touched by the scouts' kindness, offered produce for their trip. As preparations continued, Jack mentioned Ezra Sexton's quick delivery of supplies, sparking Bobolink's curiosity. Jack assured him they would find out later, and Bobolink joked about his inquisitive nature.|"[""1.

"A strong rope tied the boat closest to the shore to a large stake driven deep into the ground. This kept the boats near a small dock called a landing stage. Because the Bushkill's current was swift, the rope was under strain. The boys believed it was secure unless tampered with. Bobolink, warned of potential danger, called the rope his ""dead line"" and kept a close watch. To communicate with Andy, they used Morse code with taps on the boat. Bobolink, feeling drowsy, tried to stay alert. He imagined the chaos if the boats were set adrift. Hearing whispers, he signaled Andy.

"Bobolink, full of eagerness and excitement, saw not just one, but three more conspirators creeping towards his ""dead line."" He decided to act when they were just a foot away.

Every boy on the motorboats felt relieved when dawn arrived. Spider joked that the night felt endless, but he was thrilled that Tom hadn't pranked him with the pin. As the scouts gathered, it was clear many hadn't slept well due to the excitement of the cruise. Paul organized supplies for the trip, ensuring each boat had equal provisions. Eighteen lucky scouts were ready to set sail, while others like the Carberry twins and Poole had to miss out due to parental rules. Despite some boys being left behind, the group was packed with essentials, making it seem like they were embarking on a much longer journey. Bobolink's insistence on bringing a garden pump was denied, emphasizing the need to travel light. The scouts made sure everyone had proper permission to join the adventure, upholding their integrity.|"[""1.

"""He beats anyone in hanging on,"" said the other. ""Remember those boxes the professor stored in your father's mill? Bobolink can't stop thinking about them. He won't be happy until you find out what's inside. After that, he'll move on. Let's start if everything's ready."" The _Speedwell_ and _Comfort_ boats began their cruise down the Bushkill to Lake Tokala Island. Cheered by a crowd, the boats chugged along with flags waving. Bobolink played his bugle, and Bluff wanted to drum but left it behind. The two boats headed for the mysterious island. ""We're off at last,"" said one. ""We've got a lot to be thankful for,"" replied the other. They navigated the river carefully, avoiding sandbars.

"""You're right, Jud; and it looks like the Speedwell might go over on her beam-ends, the way she's tilted now. Good for Jack; he's ordering them all over on the upper side! That may keep her from toppling over!"" Paul exclaimed, as he gave the wheel a little turn, and headed straight for the boat in peril.

""Wow! that was a right smart trick of Jack's!"" cried Jud, in admiration. ""If he'd lost his head, like some fellows I know might have done, nothing'd ever kept that boat on her keel. And just to think what a nasty job we'd have on our hands, trying to right her again, and before our great trip had hardly started.""

""Yes,"" added Old Dan Tucker, who happened to be close to them, ""that ain't the worst of it. You know the main part of the grub's aboard the other boat. Think of those juicy hams floatin' off down the Bushkill, with not a single tooth ever bein' put in 'em; and all that bread and stuff soaked.

Bobolink, feeling relieved after an accident, learned a valuable lesson about being prepared while steering the boat. As they approached Manchester, the Stanhope Troop received cheers from the khaki-uniformed Manchester scouts. The Stanhope boys admired the straightforward nature of the Manchester lads compared to the Aldine troop. Phil spotted the mouth of the abandoned Jackson Creek, and Paul expertly navigated the boat towards it. The group proceeded cautiously due to the muddy canal bed, with Jack following Paul's lead.

Paul and his group of scouts found themselves in a tough situation while exploring a creek near their town. The boat they were on got stuck in the shallow water and thick mud. Despite their efforts to free the boat, it remained firmly grounded. With the creek water levels dropping and no immediate help in sight, the scouts realized they were in for a challenging ordeal. Paul suggested a plan to have everyone move to the back of the boat to help loosen it from the mud when he tried to use the motor at full speed again. However, as the situation seemed bleak, the scouts began to worry about being stranded and running out of supplies.

The group noticed the darkening sky and the possibility of rain. Some of Jack's crew observed the change and hoped for the rain. In the past, rain was not always welcome, but now they wished for it. They reminisced about a previous storm near Rattlesnake Mountain, causing Nuthin to feel uneasy. As the wind picked up, they secured the cover, preparing for the impending storm. The wind intensified, pushing them towards the mud-bank. Despite the challenging situation, they remained determined and vigilant. Nuthin confirmed the cover was secure, indicating safety. Joe Clausin praised Mr. Everett's quality equipment, ensuring their safety. Paul, the scout master, monitored the surroundings, ready to face any challenge.|"[""1.

The scout master explained that he set up a device to measure water gain before the storm. They might have to wait for the water to come down from up-stream. They considered making coffee and having lunch to pass the time. Dan claimed he was hungry, but the boys knew better. Paul suggested lunch might distract them. He also wanted to communicate with the other boat using flags. Paul predicted the water might rise quickly. He advised staying calm and eating. Jud shared a story about falling into the water. Paul suggested staying cool and finding other tasks to stay busy. The boys found the hour long wait tedious and joked about Joe's watch.|['1.

Paul, busy fixing the motor, inquired about the other boat's condition. He expressed his wariness of mud banks after a recent mishap. Steering clear of potential obstacles, they navigated the river cautiously. The crew, including Joe and Little Billie, felt uneasy about the mysterious island they approached. The _Comfort_ led the way, followed by the _Speedwell_. Despite some encounters with mud banks, they reached the swift Radway River. Progress was slow, but they pressed on, wary of hidden dangers. With Paul's guidance, they aimed to reach their destination before nightfall. Prepared for any challenge, Paul assured the crew they could camp on the river bank if needed.

"Joe Clausin grunted, ""Huh! that mightn't be so bad, after all."" Gusty Bellows and Little Billie nodded in agreement about camping on the bank. Both boats resumed crossing the stream.

Nuthin' mentioned a bear being killed nearby last year, making Paul glad he brought a gun for protection. Gusty believed in using an axe for defense against bears.

"""I know it, and we must be pretty near the place now,"" said the leader. ""If we don't spot it in the next ten minutes, we'll head to the shore at the next decent spot to dock our boats."" Paul was sure they were close to the big lake where the Radway flowed, once they turned the bend. Joe was amazed by the lake's size, comparing it to another one near Rattlesnake Mountain. They believed they saw the island in the distance, and Paul suggested looking for a cedar tree on top of a hill to confirm. As they left the noisy Radway waters for the calm lake, the crew felt relieved. Paul shut off the motor to wait for the other boat. As darkness fell, they navigated carefully. The boats met at the island, ready to set up camp for the night. Despite Joe's spooky story about a wild man, the scouts were excited about the adventure.

Yet, the camaraderie around the fire, with steaming coffee and hearty meals, made it all worth it. They shared duties, from cooking to dishwashing, and found joy in simple pleasures.

"""I saw him, all right, don't you forget it,"" declared the one addressed. ""And I certain sure thought he was after _me_. But if Jud says he took our nice string of bass, why that changes the thing, and makes me mad as hops. Think of us workin' all that time, only to fill up a crazy crank.

During the early afternoon, most boys gathered around the camp, each engrossed in different activities. One boy meticulously organized the morning's plant collection, while another polished quartz specimens he had discovered. A third boy focused on developing his pictures using a daylight tank. Paul, observing the busy scene, decided to fish with Jack to ensure there was enough food for supper. As they walked and chatted, Paul carried a shillelagh for protection, following Jud's example. When they spotted boot prints on the beach after a rainstorm, they speculated about potential visitors to Cedar Island.

Bobolink and Paul were discussing mysterious tracks found on Cedar Island. Bobolink speculated that the tracks could belong to yegg-men, who pretend to be hoboes but are actually burglars. Paul suggested that the men might have hidden stolen goods on the island. Jack joined the conversation, sharing a story he read about counterfeiters hiding in an old mill. The story inspired Jack to consider if the tracks on Cedar Island could be related to criminal activities. While the group acknowledged the possibility, they agreed that it was likely just a coincidence. Despite the spooky legend of Cedar Island, they concluded that the idea of criminals being involved was far-fetched.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Bobolink speculate the mysterious tracks on Cedar Island could belong to?\nA) Hoboes\nB) Burglars\nC) Yegg-men\nD) Counterfeiters\nE) Smugglers', 'Question 2:\nWhat did Paul suggest the men might have hidden on Cedar Island?\nA) Stolen goods\nB) Counterfeit money\nC) Weapons\nD) Drugs\nE) Clothing', 'Question 3:\nWhat story did Jack share with Bobolink and Paul?\nA) A story about pirates\nB) A story about lost treasure\nC) A story about counterfeiters\nD) A story about spies\nE) A story about explorers', ""Question 4:\nWhat did Jack consider could be related to criminal activities on Cedar Island?\nA) The mysterious tracks\nB) The old mill\nC) The group's conversation\nD) The spooky legend\nE) The coincidence"", 'Question 5:\nHow did the group feel about the possibility of criminals being involved on Cedar Island?\nA) Excited\nB) Nervous\nC) Concerned\nD) Skeptical\nE) Hopeful', 'Question 6:\nWhat did the group ultimately conclude about the idea of criminals being involved on Cedar Island?\nA) It was probable\nB) It was certain\nC) It was far-fetched\nD) It was dangerous\nE) It was intriguing']"|['C) Yegg-men', 'A) Stolen goods', 'C) A story about counterfeiters', 'A) The mysterious tracks', 'D) Skeptical', 'C) It was far-fetched']

Jack expressed his commitment to humane treatment of animals, emphasizing the importance of minimizing their suffering. Tom changed the subject, concerned about time away from camp. The group heard a bugle sound and rushed back. They found the scouts excited by something Jud held. Paul and Jack observed the commotion. Bobolink discovered his bugle had been tampered with. A mysterious note found on a ham puzzled the group. Despite the confusion, they were ordered to leave the island. The scouts were perplexed by the abrupt command, pondering its meaning.|"['1.

Paul determined that the note was not from someone in their group but from an outsider who sneaked into their tent unnoticed. He suspected the intruder used a nearby scrub for cover and crawled in on all fours. Upon checking the tent, they found three tent pins loosened, allowing the intruder to slip in. Paul noticed the neat writing on the note, indicating the intruder was skilled with a fountain pen. He decided to follow the trail with Jack and Bobolink to find where the intruder left. The trio ventured into the forest, keeping an eye on the tents. Bobolink expressed his frustration at the audacity of the intruders, while Jack agreed to stand their ground and not be intimidated.

However, Paul wants everyone to have a fair vote without influence. Jack suggests a hiding spot for their motorboats if they return at night.

"""Yes, I know the spot,"" Paul replied. ""There's a good place among the rocks and trees where we could set up camp and stay hidden, as long as we're quiet.

Paul agreed, emphasizing the importance of presenting their side of the plan. The scouts listened as Paul explained the situation, showing a range of emotions from alarm to annoyance. Eventually, thirteen scouts agreed to return to the island to investigate the mysterious events. They packed up in a hurried and noisy manner to give the illusion of a quick getaway. The scouts left the island under the cover of darkness, using setting poles to navigate the shallow waters back to the mainland, emphasizing the need for silence throughout the journey."|['1.

On the way, the boys were silent, lost in thought about the situation. The scout leader's plan appealed to their adventurous spirit. One boy, Old Dan Tucker, stayed quiet because he believed it was dangerous to talk with his mouth full. No one supported the plan to make a fire on the shore. Paul suggested going right to mislead others. Bobolink joked about their retreat being strategic, unlike Napoleon's. They whispered as they crossed the lake. Paul led them back to the island precisely. They adjusted their approach based on Jack's description, with Jack leading the way.

The scouts enjoyed setting up their new camp among the rocks and trees. Paul led them to a hidden spot where they could not be easily seen. They worked together to pitch their tents and build stone fireplaces for cooking. The scouts knew the importance of having a proper campfire for cooking meals. They learned to make a stone fireplace with flat stones to hold their cooking pots. The fire needed to have red embers to cook efficiently without excessive flames. Jud showed the others how to make the fire and soon they had several cooking fires going. They were careful not to create too much light or strong smells that could give away their location.

Spider Sexton noted the excellent fires, and Old Dan Tucker praised the food. Despite the feast, uneasiness lingered among the scouts, fearing hostile eyes.

Paul assigned posts, and the boys, though excited, maintained composure. They relished the adventure but were wary of the danger. In the morning, they planned to investigate the island cautiously.

Bobolink decided to sneak back into camp, leaving his post unguarded. He believed it was safe since there were three other sentries on duty. He gently woke the scout master, showing he knew where everyone was supposed to be. The scouts were aware of wildcats and wild dogs in the area, so Paul bringing a double-barreled gun was smart. Nuthin overheard Bobolink and Paul's conversation about possible danger and decided to investigate. Bobolink led Paul back to where he saw the mysterious eyes, but they were gone.

Paul had a clever idea to scare off the wild animal without using a gun. He decided to use his electric hand torch to flash light into the animal's face, hoping it would frighten it away. The scout master had thought ahead and brought the torch along for situations like this while camping. Bobolink, though lacking caution, followed Paul bravely. As they approached the rustling bushes, a growl made Bobolink chuckle nervously. Paul, prepared with his gun and torch, faced a crouching panther-like creature. Instead of firing, Paul advanced toward the animal with the bright light. Surprisingly, the beast turned and fled, disappearing into the dense scrub. Bobolink, amazed by Paul's bravery, followed closely with his club ready.

Paul and his friend Nuthin discussed the strange occurrences on Cedar Island. Nuthin mentioned that the wild dog might have joined forces with a mysterious man living like a savage. Paul thought the dog was just hungry and scared by their torchlight. As morning came, the boys were alert, showing signs of a restless night. They prepared breakfast cautiously to avoid giving away their location. Paul explained the importance of using specific woods for signaling with smoke.

The scouts were curious about the mysterious men who arrived on the island in a rowboat. They pondered the wild man's identity and his connection to the strangers. Bobolink suggested the wild man might be used to scare off intruders. The scout leader, Paul, selected a team for exploration, including Bobolink, Jack, Bluff, Tom Betts, Phil, and Andy. The remaining scouts were left under Jud Elderkin's charge. As they prepared for the expedition, they discussed theories and plans. Bobolink insisted on taking a gun in case they encountered Nuthin's old Lion, suspected of attacking local farms. Paul agreed, emphasizing the need for a lookout with a flag at the lone cedar tree.

Paul, the leader of the scout group, wanted to explore Cedar Island, but the unknown dangers made the boys nervous. As they ventured deeper into the dense forest, they kept their senses sharp, ready for any surprises. The boys were prepared for trouble, each armed with a club except for Paul, who carried a gun. The mystery surrounding the island added an exciting element to their adventure, but also a sense of responsibility and danger. The boys were on high alert, knowing that they might encounter lawless individuals on the island. Paul grappled with the decision of how far to push the group in the face of potential danger.

Paul and his friends had cleared a lot of ground on Cedar Island, though their path was not straight due to dense thorn bushes. The detours made their journey longer but promised to reveal more of the island. Paul was surprised by the thick trees blocking most of the sky, making the place seem spooky. As they approached a hill, Paul speculated the island might be closer to the mainland on the northern side. After a while, they discovered a forge in the wilderness, suggesting it was a field smithy. The scouts examined the forge and found dry ashes, indicating it hadn't been rained on. Despite hoping to find more, they only discovered a few shining coins, leaving them wondering about the forge's purpose on the secluded island.|"['1.

The boys looked serious as they realized their guess about the men making fake coins wasn't far off. Should they return home to alert the authorities or keep investigating the island? They noticed evidence of a forge being used to make the coins. The ground was trampled, indicating heavy objects were moved around. They followed tracks but noticed they abruptly stopped. Bobolink teased Bluff about grabbing the coins. Phil suggested leaving to avoid trouble if the men returned. Phil believed honest men wouldn't mind the scouts camping there.

There was no sign of life around the rustic hut. The scouts cautiously approached from what seemed to be the rear, where the entrance was located. Light filtered in through the partly open side, revealing a figure asleep on old blankets and animal skins. The scouts refrained from making noise to avoid waking him. They observed bones, a lair, and a broken rope nearby, indicating the presence of a wild man. Phil suggested that officials should capture him to prevent rumors. Bobolink found it odd that the wild man had coffee, speculating about his connection to counterfeiters.

Out of sight now. Answer!'"" No wonder Bobolink fairly held his breath, and the other five scouts looked at each other, as though they could hardly believe their ears. For a full minute they sat there and stared; while Bobolink remembered the far-away black object that, at the time, he had thought to be a buzzard. Here they had thought themselves so far removed from civilization that the only persons within a range of miles might be set down as a wild man and some lawless counterfeiters, who had chosen this region because of its inaccessibility. And now they had learned that one of the latest inventions of the day had been moving above the island, with the pilot actually looking down on the camp, and so discovering the fact of the Boy Scouts having returned after their banishment from the place. ""Picking up?"" gasped Bobolink; ""Seems to me they're getting to the red hot stage about as fast as they can. An aeroplane!
