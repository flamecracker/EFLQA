Agnes swiftly took Connie and Ronald, the well-dressed children, out onto the street. However, their hope of escaping was quickly dashed as Agnes, a stricter guardian than Mrs. Warren, steered them through the town. Agnes, appearing older and more stern, led them around without stopping for shopping. Although Connie was used to the stares, Ronald, hopeful to find his father, gazed at every passing gentleman. Upon returning home, Agnes revealed that Mammy Warren may have gone mad with grief, possibly wandering off. Agnes decided to lock the children in for safety. Connie, terrified, burst into tears, while Ronald, comforting her, shared tales of his brave father, who once saved his mother's life in a shipwreck. Ronald's courage and wise words impressed Connie, making her feel safe in his presence.|"['1.

Connie and Ronald cautiously entered Mammy Warren's room, a peculiar space with no bed in sight. Connie explained that the large wooden wardrobe likely transformed into a bed at night. Mammy Warren, the owner of the upper part of the tenement-house, rarely had visitors. The children knew to be wary of footsteps on the creaky stairs. As they searched the room, they found empty drawers and no tools. The mysterious yellow and black silk dress had vanished, leaving behind old beggar's clothes. Despite the scarcity of provisions, Connie made a meager but satisfying meal of tea and toast with jam. Feeling safer, Connie suggested bringing their beds into the room, convinced Mammy Warren wouldn't return that night.

Connie decided to move her bed to the front room and lay on the floor beside Ronald. Despite her urging, Ronald refused to undress before falling asleep. Connie, noticing Ronald's deep slumber, chose to sit beside him instead. As they slept, the chimes of Big Ben rang out, but the children remained undisturbed. In their dreams, they found solace from their harsh reality. The fire, now dwindling, had tried its best to warm them but eventually faded away. Suddenly, a loud roar jolted them awake. It was the cry of a fire spreading through the building. Connie reassured Ronald, reminding him to stay brave like the verse they cherished.

Sue was deeply troubled by Peter Harris's distressing story about Connie's disappearance. She was moved by his regret for turning her away and his concern for the missing girl.

She decided to seek refuge with Mrs. Anderson if her father did not return. Connie then visited Giles and Sue, finding Giles weak and in need of a doctor. Mrs. Nelson mentioned that Dr. Deane was attending to another patient in the house and would see Giles soon.

Connie was relieved to have the doctor nearby and returned to the boy, who was now lying with closed eyes, breathing rapidly. Dr. Deane, a kind young man who understood the struggles of the less fortunate, examined the boy carefully. After assessing the situation, he comforted the boy and prescribed a strengthening medicine, a bottle of port wine, and other nourishing foods. The doctor urged Connie not to worry and assured her that he would send over a basket of provisions for the boy. Connie, who had faced many challenges, had learned to be selfless and composed. She quickly prepared a meal for the boy from the provisions sent by the doctor and tended to him attentively.

Connie, a young and inexperienced girl, felt a mix of fear and joy as her father, Harris, left to bring back a boy named Giles. She prepared a cozy place for Giles in her home, using her mother's precious belongings. Connie's optimism shone through as she imagined Giles recovering in the comfort of her care. She made a warm bed for him with linen sheets, a soft blanket, and a down pillow covered in a frilled case. A crimson and gold silk shawl, once her mother's, adorned the couch for Giles. Harris returned with Giles, and Connie tended to him lovingly, ensuring his comfort with a hot bottle for his feet. The next morning, Connie reflected on the kindness of a mysterious man named Simeon Stylites, who had helped her.

Connie's mind quickly shifted from various characters to the fact that Sue was missing and Giles was at her father's house. She hurried out of bed, got dressed, and entered the living room. To her surprise, her father had already left, and Giles was sitting up, looking pretty with a shawl covering him. Giles mentioned that Sue had left to explore and surprise him. Connie mentioned the beauty of the countryside, but Giles pointed out that not all people from London were good. He admired Connie's beauty, comparing her to Cinderella.

Mrs. Price had two very different sons. William, the elder one, was quiet, thoughtful, and kind-hearted. He was reserved but spoke wisely when he did.

Tea was served, and the children enjoyed it, but Ronald's mind was preoccupied with seeing Giles. He pleaded with Connie to take him to visit the little boy, despite needing permission from Mrs. Anderson. As they debated, a cab arrived, and an elderly man entered the house. Ronald, intrigued, rushed to the window but missed seeing the man. Excited by Connie's tentative approval, Ronald hurried to get ready to visit Giles, forgetting to change his house shoes.

I'll hide here with you, Giles."" He jumped up and walked across the room. His eyes were dim; his heart was beating rapidly, for he was still weak and had gone through much. Oh, that cruel old man who had made his mother cry so often! He thought of him with growing terror.

""Yes, but I must. I am very sad. I wish I needn't send him; but the gentleman who called today is his father's uncle, and his nearest relation in the world. Connie, you must bring Ronald home. I will go with you myself to fetch him.""

It is true that Pickles had tightened the screws on Harris, making him feel uneasy on his way home. Sue had been apprehended and imprisoned, witnessed by a bothersome boy who observed her flight, heard her pleas of innocence, and saw her taken away.

Harris adored Connie, missing her deeply during her absence. He found solace in his home, especially with little Giles, who held a special place in his heart. Harris feared the day Giles might look at him with disappointment or turn away. The guilt of past mistakes weighed heavily on him. To escape his torment, Harris turned to alcohol at a nearby pub. Meanwhile, Connie and Giles awaited Sue's return, but she never showed up. Giles, despite his illness, remained optimistic, believing that trials were part of a greater plan. As Giles' condition worsened, Connie's care helped ease his suffering. Harris struggled with his guilt but found some peace in providing for Giles and Connie.

Two days later, it was Sunday. Pickles and his mother went to church, but Sue stayed behind. She had been too scared to go out in public despite her disguise. Today, when her mother and brother left, she hurried to her small attic room. Inside an old box without a lock, Sue found musty clothes. Among them was a purple silk dress that she admired. She put it on, along with a Paisley shawl and an old bonnet, feeling completely disguised. She ventured outside, breathing in the fresh air through a gauze veil.

As Harris approached, his initial instinct was to flee, but the clever young detective Pickles prevented his escape. Harris, overwhelmed by a mix of emotions and fear, confessed to his daughter, Connie, about the theft. Connie, displaying unwavering loyalty, stood by her father despite the shocking revelation. Determined to help Sue, Connie and Harris embarked on a search that led them to St. Thomas's Hospital, where Sue was being treated for a broken leg.

"""Hush, be quiet,"" said the rough man. ""I am willing to do all that is necessary. Now then, nurse,"" he continued, ""you see my girl--she's rather upset about that poor Cinderella upstairs. But have you nothing else to say about her?""

""Sister Elizabeth has given you permission to come up and see the child for a few minutes. This, remember, is absolutely against the ordinary rules; but her case is exceptional, and if you can give her relief of mind, so much the better.""

Then Connie and her father followed the nurse up the wide, clean stairs, and down the wide, spotless-looking corridors, until they softly entered a room where many children were lying, some asleep, some tossing from side to side with pain.

Sue's little bed was the fifth from the door, and Sue was lying on her back, listening intently, for Big Ben would soon proclaim the hour. She did not turn her head when the nurse and the two who were seeking her entered the ward; but by-and-by a voice, not Big Ben's, sounded on her ear, and Connie flung herself by her side and covered her hand with kisses.
