When I was a boy, I had amazing adventures. I share my book with boys, hoping they find joy, profit, and fun. But if anyone prefers gloom, this book isn't for them. I've always loved exploring. Born at sea, my family has deep ties to the ocean. My father, grandfather, and great-grandfather were all sea captains. I inherited their love for the sea. My roving spirit emerged early. As a child, I longed to walk and explore. My mother was shocked to find me muddy among ducks. I roamed more as I grew, until my father let me apprentice on a ship. My shipmates called me Ralph Rover due to my love for travel. They found me old-fashioned, but I didn't understand why. Despite their jokes, I smiled and stayed curious about the world.|"['1.

During my time in the coasting trade, I met seasoned sailors who shared thrilling tales of their adventures around the world. Their stories of surviving storms, encountering dangerous creatures, and exploring exotic lands fascinated me. Among all the places they described, the Coral Islands in the Southern Seas captured my imagination the most. These islands, created by coral insects, boasted lush landscapes, abundant fruit trees, and a delightful climate. However, the inhabitants were often savage, except in places where Christianity had reached. These captivating narratives inspired me to embark on a voyage to the South Seas at the age of fifteen. Despite initial reluctance, my parents eventually agreed, with my mother's heartfelt plea for my safe return echoing in my ears as I set sail on the _Arrow_ with a seasoned captain and newfound friends, Jack and Peterkin. The journey began with the lifting of the anchor, signaling our departure from familiar shores towards the unknown adventures that awaited us at sea.|"['1.

As we neared Cape Horn, the weather turned icy and turbulent. Sailors shared tales of the fierce storms and perils of this dreaded cape. Surprisingly, we passed it smoothly and soon found ourselves sailing tranquilly across the Pacific. Our journey was a mix of fair winds and calm seas, with moments of fishing and marveling at the ocean's wonders. Eventually, we reached the Coral Islands, their white shores and lush palm trees a sight to behold. One stormy night, disaster struck our ship, leaving us at the mercy of the elements. Amidst the chaos, we spotted an island ahead, surrounded by treacherous coral reefs. With courage and a plan, we faced the impending danger, clinging to hope and each other as we braved the unforgiving sea.|"[""1.

After waking from fainting, I found myself lying on soft grass under a rock, with Peterkin beside me. He was gently tending to my wound and offering water. Slowly regaining consciousness was a strange feeling, a mix of dreaminess and weariness that wasn't unpleasant. As I heard Peterkin's voice checking on me, I felt like I had overslept and would be in trouble. Thoughts of home and the sea crossed my mind. Peterkin and Jack explained how we ended up on the island after our shipwreck. They detailed our escape and the fate of our ship and crew.

We were dressed in sturdy canvas trousers and thick sailors' shoes. Jack wore a red flannel shirt, a blue jacket, and a red nightcap, along with worsted socks, a cotton handkerchief with Lord Nelson's portraits, and a Union Jack. Peterkin sported a striped shirt, worn outside his trousers like a tunic, and a black straw hat. I had on a blue flannel shirt, a blue jacket, a black cap, and worsted socks. Grateful for our survival, we set out to explore the island. The scenery was breathtaking, with hills covered in colorful trees and bushes. The sea was calm near the shore, with waves crashing on a distant coral reef. The beauty of nature filled our hearts with joy, reminding us of the Creator's wonders. Peterkin's excitement over a discovery added to our delight.|"[""1.

Upon reaching the shore, Peterkin struggled to free the axe lodged in the oar, where Jack had wedged it while cutting tangled cordage. Luckily, the axe held firm, resisting Peterkin's efforts. Jack, with a deft twist, freed the axe, praising its value over a hundred knives. Peterkin, exhausted, noticed iron on the blade, a welcome surprise. They decided to burn the wood off later to retrieve the iron. Jack proposed exploring the island's tail for more washed-up items, met with agreement from the others. As they walked along the dazzling beach, Peterkin realized they lacked food, except for wild berries. Jack assured them the berries were safe, having seen birds eat them. Spotting a coconut palm, Jack pointed out the nuts above, prompting Peterkin to climb and retrieve three large nuts. Thirsty, Peterkin wished for a spring, amazed at Jack's knowledge despite being new to the South Seas.|"[""1.

Jack responded to Peterkin's skepticism about the value of books by highlighting the practical knowledge he gained from reading. He challenged Peterkin to climb a cocoa-nut tree and taste the refreshing liquid inside a green nut. Peterkin's comical reaction to the unexpected taste amused them all. They then discovered the captain's boots washed ashore, indicating he might have survived.

Peterkin quickly tried on the oversized boots, trousers, and vest, but they were too big for him. Even though they fit Jack perfectly, he insisted on giving them back to me. We decided to build a leafy bower to sleep in for the night, although the island's weather was pleasant. As night fell, we struggled to light a fire for supper until Peterkin remembered the spy-glass could be used as a burning glass. Jack ingeniously created a fire using a bow and tinder. The warm glow of the fire illuminated our makeshift shelter under the palm trees. The next morning, we awoke to the beauty of the tropical sunrise and ventured into the sea to explore the coral groves, marveling at the wonders of the deep.|"['1.

As I sat pondering, thoughts of my Bible crossed my mind. I had vowed to my dear mother that I would read it every morning, but I had left it on the ship, causing me distress. Yet, I found solace in knowing I could still keep my promise by saying my prayers. Quietly rising so as not to disturb my sleeping companions, I retreated to the bushes for this purpose. Upon returning, finding them still asleep, I lay back to contemplate our circumstances. Suddenly, a small parrot caught my eye, amusing me with its antics near Peterkin. The parrot's antics made me chuckle, imagining the bird falling into Peterkin's open mouth. The parrot's loud squawk woke Peterkin, who, realizing our situation, joyfully leaped into the sea, followed by Jack. Inspired, I shed my clothes to join them, though my clumsiness provided Peterkin with some amusement. After a few mishaps, I managed to swim and dive alongside Jack. The sea floor, a vibrant coral garden teeming with colorful fish, left me in awe.|"['1.

"""Jack exclaimed, 'Dreaming! Ralph, I feel like we're in a dream. But if it is, I'm going to enjoy it. Let's dive again!' So, we plunged for a second time, amazed at how long we could stay underwater due to the warm water. Jack dove down, exploring coral and picking up oysters. He even tried to catch a colorful fish but came up coughing and sputtering. Back on shore, we found oysters for breakfast and planned our day.

After preparing and putting out our fire, we set off along the beach until we reached a valley entrance with a stream. The view was stunning as we entered the valley, with ridges on each side covered in lush trees and shrubs. We decided to head towards a small mountain at the valley's end. Jack led the way with an axe, Peterkin followed with a club to defend us, while I foolishly left my club behind. The foliage was thick but allowed us to move easily, although we couldn't see far ahead. As we walked, we saw various plants and birds, enjoying the scenery and marking our progress towards the hill. Suddenly, a loud noise startled us, but it turned out to be just a rock rolling down the hill. We realized it was a common occurrence due to the rocky terrain.

We continued our journey, vowing to steer clear of the perilous cliff in our future explorations. As we approached the hill, Jack's excitement grew as he spotted a magnificent tree. He identified it as the prized bread-fruit tree, explaining its significance to us. This tree bore fruit resembling bread, providing essential sustenance for the islanders. Additionally, it yielded valuable gum for canoe sealing, cloth from its branches' bark, and sturdy wood for construction. Jack's knowledge impressed us, but he humbly admitted there was much more to learn. Peterkin praised Jack, only to be playfully tripped by him. Undeterred, we admired the tree's lush green leaves and colorful fruit, marveling at the island's unique flora.

"We were puzzled by the discovery of a large tree stump on the mountain, unlike the small wood the crew of a ship would usually cut. Jack, scratching the stump, uncovered three marks resembling initials. Weathering had made them illegible, but they seemed to be ""J.S."" As we pondered this mystery, we reached the island's peak, offering a panoramic view of our surroundings. The island featured two mountains, a lush valley, and a white sandy beach encircled by a coral reef. The calm lagoon contrasted with the roaring surf outside the reef. The island's diameter was approximately ten miles, with several small coral islets marking the reef openings. Our captain had aimed for one of these openings before our shipwreck. The lagoon housed coral islands, while smaller uninhabited islands dotted the sea beyond."|"['1.

From the mountain top, we observed signs of past human presence: a decayed pole, squared wood pieces. Excited, we returned to camp. On the way, we spotted animal tracks, boosting hopes of food. Despite our comfort, we hesitated to settle permanently, longing for home. Uncertainty lingered about island natives or a rescue ship. As days passed, we faced reality and focused on our shelter. We experimented with cooking coconuts, moved to a cave briefly, then back to our bower. Jack crafted a knife from hoop iron, using it to make tools. Peterkin, unhappy with small catches, requested Jack swim him to deep waters for fishing. Jack, always inventive, pondered a solution.|"['1.

We all agreed and set off for a tree near the water's edge. Jack took the lead, chopping at it with the axe vigorously. After a quarter of an hour, I took over, and then Peterkin joined in. With combined efforts, we brought the tree down with a crash. We then cut the log into manageable pieces and used them as levers to roll it into the sea. Once in the water, we fashioned the levers into paddles and tried to balance ourselves on the log to fish. Despite a few mishaps, we managed to stay afloat and even caught a fish. Suddenly, Jack warned us of a shark nearby, and we quickly paddled away, leaving our fishing behind.|"[""1.

The terror we felt was indescribable. Picture this: our legs dangled in the water, unable to move for fear of tipping the log. Peterkin swiftly reeled in the line and paddled with all his might towards the shore. But the heavy log moved slowly, and the shark circled closer, its fin cutting through the water. Jack sensed the imminent attack and urged us to paddle frantically. Just as the shark lunged, Jack's quick thinking saved us. With a fierce thrust, he jabbed the shark's jaws with his paddle, causing it to roll the log over, plunging us into the water. Gasping for air, we emerged from the water, safe but shaken.|"[""1.

Peterkin followed Jack's lead and swam with such speed that he cut through the water swiftly. I, unburdened, managed to keep up with them. As we neared the shore, we landed safely but exhausted and shaken from our encounter with the shark. Our daily swims in the lagoon had to be replaced with fishing in shallow waters until we could build a raft. We missed diving among the coral groves but discovered a deep pool surrounded by rocks, our Water Garden. Here, the sea life was more vibrant, and the water crystal clear. We observed the coral insects and marveled at the underwater world, making new and fascinating discoveries.

"""New 'prentice!"" exclaimed the captain, furious at the young boy who he thought had run away. The captain, angry at the idea of stopping the ship to send the boy ashore, decided to toss him overboard. The boy, being able to swim, made his way to the pierhead. There, they found a tree that they identified as a candle-nut tree. Its silvery white leaves contrasted with the dark-green foliage around it. They filled their pockets with the nuts from the tree.

Jack mentioned hearing a mysterious sound that had been faint in the past but was louder that night. Although Peterkin was not spooked by ghosts, Jack was curious about the sound. The three boys prepared for an upcoming adventure by crafting weapons. Jack made a bow with arrows, Peterkin modified a spear, and the narrator fashioned a sling. They practiced using their weapons but needed improvement. Jack's leadership and perseverance motivated them. The next morning, they readied themselves for the journey. Jack, the narrator, and Peterkin set out equipped with their weapons and belts. They did not carry food, relying on finding coconuts along the way.

Peterkin, Jack, and I explored our island together, sometimes in single file through the woods and other times walking abreast along the sandy shore. In the woods, we followed each other to move easily, with Jack leading, Peterkin following, and me at the rear. Along the beach, we walked side by side, enjoying each other's company. Peterkin joked that if he were taller, our order of march would remain the same. As we strolled, we noticed the beauty of the tropical vegetation. Suddenly, we saw mysterious columns of spray rising from the rocks inland. Curious, we approached the spot and were surprised by spouts of water bursting from the rocks, drenching us.

We found ourselves on a remarkable island with a diverse array of flora and fauna. The discovery of various roots and fruits enriched our provision. The banyan tree, with branches that grew down to form new trees, was a natural wonder. We marveled at the lush valley and its abundant trees, some with golden fruit and silvery foliage. Among them were cocoa-nut palms, standing tall like guardians. The trees' hues and shapes painted a mesmerizing scene, a true gift of nature. Jack pointed out that what we thought to be a forest was actually one magnificent tree. Its branches sent down shoots that rooted themselves, creating a forest-like illusion. The island's beauty left us in awe, grateful for being in such a paradise.|"['1.

After finding a chestnut tree with remarkable buttresses that could be used as natural planks, Jack and his friends decided to head back to the coast to camp due to troublesome mosquitoes. On their way, they admired colorful birds like paroquets and wood-pigeons. They attempted to hunt for food but were unsuccessful until they managed to catch a pigeon with a sling. Later, they spotted wild-ducks flying towards a blue lake surrounded by lush trees. The lake was teeming with ducks and other waterfowl. Jack and his friends tried to catch a duck but couldn't find any. As they were about to leave, they stumbled upon a massive tree with yellow plum-like fruit and hogs sleeping contentedly underneath, suggesting a bountiful feast had taken place.|['1.

Advised, I threw my stone accurately at the hog's flank, causing it to startle and run off. Simultaneously, Jack's arrow struck the pig's ear, pinning it briefly before it escaped with the herd. As we approached our campsite, prepared by Peterkin, we realized he was missing. A distant shriek alarmed us, followed by the hogs' yells. Despite the confusion, we managed to cook a feast of pig, taro-root, yam, potato, plums, and wood-pigeon over the fire. Jack skillfully butchered the pig with the axe. The taro-root resembled a grey potato, the yam was sweet, and the potato surprisingly palatable. After the lavish meal, we rested under the coral rock ledge. The next morning, despite the late start due to our heavy supper, we felt invigorated and ready for breakfast after a refreshing morning swim.|"[""1.

In my later years, I often ponder why people in my homeland do not take advantage of the refreshing benefits of water, particularly through cold baths. While I understand that the climate may not always permit swimming in the sea or rivers like we did on the Coral Island, a simple washing-tub and sponge can provide a delightful substitute. The invigorating feelings of freshness and vitality that followed my sea baths, and even wash-tub ablutions in England, were so enjoyable that I would prioritize them over breakfast. I encourage readers to consider incorporating cold bathing into their morning routine for its rejuvenating effects. As I transitioned from my adventurous life to learning about the cold-water cure, I realized the importance of balance in all things. While I cannot advocate for or against the system, my personal experiences with cold bathing lead me to believe that it's better to risk overindulging than depriving oneself of such a beneficial practice.|"['1.

We observed that while many fruit trees thrived in the valleys or near streams with rich soil, the coconut palm grew everywhere. It flourished on hillsides, seashores, and even on coral reefs with sandy soil. The roots of these palms were washed by sea spray, yet they were as healthy and fruitful as those in the valleys. Exploring a high mountain, we found shells and coral, indicating the island was once underwater or the sea was higher. Puzzled by how the island rose, we debated if a volcano or natural forces were responsible. Noticing the different rocks inland from the coral, we delved into deep discussions. Despite Peterkin's humor, we continued our observations. We discovered wild animals' footprints, including a blind and deaf black cat that showed immense joy and affection towards us, hinting it may have known humans before.|['1.

We decided to follow the trail further, and Peterkin gently placed the weak cat on the ground, but it seemed too feeble and let out a pitiful meow. Peterkin picked it up again and cradled it in his arms until it drifted off to sleep. As we advanced, we encountered more felled trees and the path veered right, running parallel to a stream. Suddenly, we reached the remains of a rudimentary bridge, stones scattered in the water and covered with moss. Continuing forward, we discovered a small, desolate hut nestled under breadfruit trees. The structure was simple, measuring about twelve by ten feet, with a low door and a roof of coconut and plantain leaves. The hut appeared abandoned, with moss and decay evident throughout. Inside, we found only a small wooden stool, an iron pot, and two skeletons - one of a man and the other of a dog, both resting in a heap of dust. This discovery left us somber and reflective, pondering the mysterious history of this solitary dwelling and its inhabitants.|['1.

After a long journey exploring the island, we stumbled upon a lonely hut with a sad tale to tell. Inside, we found the remains of a poor wanderer, possibly a shipwrecked sailor, and his loyal dog and cat. Despite the desolation, we were moved by the love and loyalty the dog showed, while the cat chose a solitary life. We decided to dismantle the hut to create a grave for the recluse and his pets. Returning to our bower, we realized the importance of rest for both body and mind, each needing different forms of respite. Our exhausting journey left us in need of deep repose, and we found solace in a long rest, falling into a profound sleep until the following day.

After waking up feeling refreshed, we were worried we might have lost track of time. We had been keeping count of the days since we arrived on the island to remember the Sabbath. Thankfully, after discussing it, we all agreed on how long we had slept, easing our minds. We then headed to the Water Garden to swim and check on the animals in the tank. To our dismay, most of the animals were dead, and the water was foul. Peterkin pointed out that the animals couldn't survive in such conditions. Jack suggested imitating the ocean in the tank and maintaining the right saltness level by adding fresh water. He also advised adding seaweed, sand, and gravel to create a miniature Pacific. Peterkin joked about needing three little men to dive in the tank for perfection. But then he noticed a crab shedding its shell, a fascinating sight for all of us.|['1.

We quickly bent over the tank and were quite amused by the behavior of one of the crabs that had survived its companions. It was a small crab, similar to those found on the coasts of England. As we watched, its back split away from its body, and a soft lump emerged and wriggled continuously. The lump grew into a bunch of crab's legs, and soon a complete new crab emerged, leaving behind its old shell. This amazed us, especially when we realized the new crab was larger than the original one. I began to appreciate Jack's advice on maintaining the tank, which proved to be very effective. I spent days observing the tank's inhabitants with a burning glass, witnessing the fascinating activities of sea creatures. I wished that people inland could witness the wonders of the sea through tanks like mine.|"['1.

Interrupting their talk, I mentioned we hadn't figured out the strange sight near the water-spouts on our island journey. We decided to investigate. Making our way to the water-spouts, we peered over the rocks and saw the green object still moving in the sea. Peterkin aimed his spear, striking the object cleanly. Curious, I suggested diving down. Jack, a skilled diver, stripped and plunged in. Minutes passed, and worry set in as Jack stayed underwater longer than usual. Fear gripped us. Peterkin, pale with dread, cried out, fearing a shark had taken Jack. Suddenly, Jack emerged, astonishing us with his prolonged dive. Relieved, we helped him ashore, amazed by his endurance.|"['1.

Peterkin finally calmed down, listening to Jack's explanation. He couldn't resist winking at me every two minutes to show his relief at Jack's safety. However, due to his swollen eyes from crying, his attempts resulted in funny faces. Despite this, I understood his joy and smiled back. Jack explained that the green light wasn't a shark but from a cave. He described his dive into the luminous cave, where he saw glittering objects. Excited, we planned to explore the cave with a torch. Crafting a torch from tree bark and resin, we wrapped it in coconut cloth to keep it dry. Jack assured Peterkin we'd return soon, and with a playful farewell, we dived back into the sea to explore the mysterious cave.|"[""1.

We entered the submarine cave easily and floated in the water, holding our bundles above us to adjust to the dim light. Once our eyes adjusted, we swam to a rocky ledge and landed safely. After drying off, we lit a torch and were amazed by the stunning coral structure of the cave. The pillars and ceiling sparkled like precious stones, and the floor resembled rippled water. As we explored deeper, we noticed openings leading to other caverns but didn't venture in. The cave's pure white coral rock near the entrance reflected light, creating a mystical atmosphere. Before leaving, we extinguished our torch and marveled at the beauty hidden in the darkness. Exiting the cave, we rejoiced in the sunshine and fresh air, grateful for the unique experience in the Diamond Cave.|['1.

"Jack and I were amazed that we hadn't noticed this in the first few days of living here. We were so engrossed with the obvious marvels of our new environment. I have since realized that many people miss incredible things happening daily before them due to this common human trait. I sympathize with them and recommend a practice I've adopted—forcibly paying attention to all around me, taking interest in things whether I naturally feel it or not. We had a serious talk about tides, with Jack explaining how they benefit the world by cleansing the shores and carrying away filth. Peterkin, always ready to joke, found it ""tidy"" of the tides.

Peterkin, despite his initial hesitation, decided to take down the old sow with a single, swift strike, surprising his friends. Jack, upon arrival, questioned Peterkin's choice of prey, to which Peterkin explained his need for leather to craft shoes. The trio then devised a plan to transport the heavy hog back to their bower by tying its feet and carrying it with a spear handle. Laden with their spoils, they returned triumphantly. Jack dedicated himself to building a boat using materials from a chestnut tree, displaying remarkable ingenuity with limited tools. By fashioning wooden nails and cordage from coconut husks, they successfully constructed the boat, illustrating their determination and resourcefulness on the island.|['1.

We made a boat from chestnut tree planks, sewing them together with cordage. To make it waterproof, we used cocoa-nut fiber between the planks and coated the inside with pitch. Our table was a coral rock, where we enjoyed feasts of bread-fruit, roast pig, and more. Our cat shared in the bounty too. Jack surprised us by finishing the boat sooner than expected. We laughed and joked over a meal, planning to row it that afternoon. Although we couldn't sail, rowing would be a good start.|['1.

Jack excitedly shared his plan with us. We would craft a sail from coconut cloth and set up a mast to sail to other islands to visit our penguin friends. The thought of exploring new islands and sailing across the beautiful sea filled us with joy. After dinner, we got to work making oars. Jack cut them roughly with an axe, and I smoothed them with a knife. Meanwhile, Peterkin spun strong cordage to fasten the oars to the boat. By sunset, we had four sturdy oars ready. As we approached our bower, we heard a voice. Curious, we peeked in and saw Peterkin having a conversation with our black cat. He expressed his love for the cat and playfully scolded it for keeping us waiting for supper. Despite the amusing sight, Peterkin blushed when he noticed us listening. We launched our boat on a serene morning, rowing over the calm waters of the lagoon, surrounded by the beauty of nature.|['1.

Initially, filled with joy, we rowed aimlessly around. But as our excitement waned, we pondered our next steps. With four oars but a small boat, only two were needed, the rest kept in case of emergency. Two rowed while the third steered. Landing on a small island, we explored but found nothing remarkable. Moving to a larger island with coconut trees, we ate and then headed to the coral reef. The sight was captivating, with a massive breaker rising above the sea level. The wave crashed with a thunderous roar, leaving us mesmerized. We observed how the reef served as a barrier against the force of the waves, witnessing the formation of future islands. Reflecting on how coral islands are created, we marveled at nature's intricate processes.|['1.

"""Be quiet, Peterkin,"" Jack said sternly, grabbing the oars. ""Come help me. First, gather coconut fiber to make twine. Then assist Ralph with coconut cloth for a sail. I'll handle the mast and rigging. Let's get to work."" We worked diligently, setting up a mast and sail in three days. The sail, though patchy, was sturdy. Jack added a false keel for safety and wind resistance. With the boat ready, we joyfully sailed the lagoon, exploring the island and watching colorful fish. Peterkin made a fishing line, and Jack crafted hooks from ironwood and a brass finger ring. Fishing became a daily pleasure, observing porpoises, swordfish, whales, and sharks. The swordfish, with long spears, amazed us with their hunting skills. Fishing with the brass hook provided endless entertainment and a bountiful catch of fish."|['1.

Sharks were a rare sight, but we made sure to always have someone in the boat to warn us if one approached while swimming in deep water. Whales were often seen spouting beyond the reef but never entered our lagoon. The first encounter with a massive whale left us in awe. Witnessing its immense size up close was unforgettable. Flying-fish darted away from dolphins, intriguing us with their escape tactics. After rain, we found fish in shallow pools, a mystery Jack suggested might be linked to waterspouts. Our fishing adventures yielded eels, turtles for soup, and an array of shrimps and prawns for our meals.

The massive wave crashed over the reef with a deafening roar, sending water spouts shooting up like geysers. The force of the wave swept over the island, devastating everything in its path. The boys feared for their bower and boat, but miraculously found the boat nestled safely in a bush. It took them two days of hard work to free the boat and clear the debris. Following the cleanup, they decided to visit the penguins. After repairing the boat and gathering provisions, they set off on their adventure, with Peterkin hunting for hogs in the woods. Despite his reckless nature, Peterkin was a skilled hunter, but sometimes his adventures led to mishaps. Once, he was found unconscious at the foot of a bank, with a pig pinned under his spear.

Peterkin and his friends set out on a hunting and gathering adventure. Despite some mishaps, they managed to secure three hogs and several ducks for provisions. The group prepared the food, including a stuffing concocted by Peterkin, which turned out to be quite awful. After sampling it, they discarded the stuffing. They loaded their boat with an abundance of supplies, ensuring they were well-prepared for their voyage ahead. The next morning, under clear skies, they rowed out towards the open sea, opting for a more adventurous route.

"Jack exclaimed excitedly, ""Or bore a hole through a shark's tail, and reeve a rope through it, eh?"" anticipating an adventure. As a breeze approached, he swiftly commanded, ""Ship your oar, Peterkin. Up with the mast, Ralph; I'll see to the sail. Mind your helm; look out for squalls!"" The dark-blue line on the horizon swiftly advanced, churning the sea into white foam. The crew turned the boat's stern to face the forceful wind, then swiftly hoisted the sail, gliding joyfully over the waves. Approaching Penguin Island, they marveled at the peculiar penguins with their distinctive features and amusing behaviors.

We watched as the penguins on the island went about their daily routines. The young penguins were fed by their mothers, who seemed to deceive them into swimming. Some of the young ones were pushed into the water by their mothers, who tried to make it seem like a gentle nudge. We observed how the penguins hopped clumsily towards the sea, some rolling and scrambling down the slope. Once in the water, they were transformed, diving and swimming with agility. As we debated whether the island was enchanted, we decided to land and explore. Armed with cudgels and a spear, we approached the penguins, who showed no fear. One penguin bravely advanced towards the sea, even when confronted by Peterkin. Despite the challenges we faced with the wind and waves, we marveled at the wonder of these creatures, considering them the most extraordinary beings we had encountered.|"['1.

Jack spoke as the wind shifted suddenly, forcing us to hoist more sail to beat towards the island. Strong squalls nearly upset us. Accustomed to trusting Jack, we hadn't questioned much. Anxious, we heard Jack's concern about the approaching squall. We swiftly lowered the sail as a heavy squall hit, causing the boat to fill with water. Bailing out water, we realized making it to Penguin Island was impossible. Swept towards the open sea, we faced the grim reality of being stranded. Spotting a low island ahead, we aimed for it. The island, a coral formation, was battered by waves. We managed to reach a calm creek, barely fitting our boat, where we secured it. Though safe, we were drenched, surrounded by raging sea. Peterkin likened our situation to a mermaid's cave, enclosed by water and spray.|"[""1.

Thankfully, the cave, though not deep, was dry, making us more comfortable than expected. We unloaded our supplies, dried our clothes, used the sail as a carpet, and after a good meal, felt cheerful. However, as night fell, our spirits dropped. The storm erased all signs of safety, leaving us in darkness. Lightning flashes and thunder added to our fear. Waves crashed, threatening our refuge. After enduring three days and nights of the raging storm, it finally calmed. We set off for home, relieved to see our island on the horizon. Rowing and sailing, we passed islands, including Penguin Island. Returning to our beloved home, we found it untouched. Living harmoniously on the island, we fished, hunted, and enjoyed the perpetual summer climate, feeling content in our captivity.|"['1.

During our time on the island, we kept busy making clothes from coconut cloth as our old garments were getting worn out. Peterkin even crafted shoes from the old hog's skin. He cut an oblong piece longer than his foot, soaked it, sewed one end to imitate a shoe's heel, and then laced it up. Although the shoes had puckers, they were useful. We also made other items for comfort and considered building a house but decided against it as we loved our bower. We enjoyed diving in the Water Garden, and Peterkin improved his swimming skills. Jack joked that we might turn into fish with our water skills. One day, we saw two canoes approaching fast. Jack warned they might be cannibals, so we hid. We armed ourselves with clubs and watched the canoes closely as they landed on the beach.|"[""1.

The distance between the two canoes was about half a mile, and they quickly closed the gap due to their high speed. As the pursuers approached the shore, they showed no signs of fear or hesitation. They charged forward like wild animals, paying no heed to the stones thrown at them. When the canoe hit the shore, the men leaped out with terrifying yells, engaging in a brutal battle. Most of them used large clubs to attack each other savagely. The attackers, led by a peculiar chief with yellow frizzy hair and a fearsome appearance, fought fiercely. Suddenly, the chief was challenged by an equally strong man, resulting in a dramatic and violent confrontation. Eventually, the attackers were defeated, and the survivors were captured and bound. The victors then proceeded to treat the captives in a gruesome manner, causing shock and horror among the observers.|['1.

In the forest, two savages suddenly emerged dragging three women and two infants towards a fire. One of the women, much younger and of a lighter complexion, showed modesty and gentleness. The savages wore short petticoats and tippets. The chief cruelly tossed one infant into the sea, causing the mother to faint. Threatening the young girl, the chief pointed to the fire.

"After the battle, the natives gathered around us, asking questions we couldn't understand. Jack shook hands with the chief to show goodwill, and soon the others followed suit. Jack then signaled a girl to join him, and they found a baby alive on the shore. The mother, slowly recovering, embraced her child joyfully. Jack then led the group to their bower for a meal. They enjoyed roast pig, ducks, fish, and fruits. We, exhausted, drank coconut lemonade and fell asleep. When we awoke, the sun was high. Jack, surprised, roused us for breakfast.

"Jack approached the woman and spoke the word ""Avatea."" She smiled sadly, pointing to her chest and then the sun, just like the chief had done. Perplexed, we had to accept this mystery.

Jack gestured for a burial, and the natives quickly dug a pit, tossing the dead into it. One savage attempted to eat flesh from the fallen chief, causing disgust.

When the boat was ready, we helped the locals load the prisoners and supplies onto it. Peterkin went after the hogs, catching six for a feast before our friends left. Tararo invited us to his island, but we politely declined. As a parting gift, we gave him our rusty axe, a wooden piece with our names, and a string. We all exchanged nose rubs as a farewell gesture.

Peterkin took a deep breath as he reached the surface, and soon we were all safe on a rock ledge. Jack searched for the tinder and torch in the cave, quickly lighting it to reveal the wonders within. Wet from our ordeal, we wasted no time exploring. Our priority was drying our clothes. Jack reassured Peterkin that the pirates wouldn't stay long on the island. We prepared to spend the night in the cavern, where we had stored supplies like coconuts and cloth. Our meal by torchlight felt eerie but comforting. As night fell, we extinguished the torch and settled in for rest. The next day, uncertain of the time, I decided to scout outside while Jack and Peterkin remained behind.

My heart raced as I saw a towering man with a fierce look and a hint of contempt in his smile.

Upon regaining consciousness, I saw that we were beyond the coral reef next to the small, fast-sailing schooner. Quickly, a crew member ordered me aboard with a rough kick. As I climbed up, the boat was hoisted, and we sailed away from the Coral Island. The crew, busy working, paid me no mind, so I observed the ship's neatness and lack of weapons. The captain, tall and fearless, stood out among the crew of thirty to forty men. Their attire varied, but all weapons were stowed except for the captain's cutlass and pistol. The captain's bold and fierce demeanor made him both feared and respected. As I thought of my friends left behind, tears welled up, drawing the captain's ire.

In thirty minutes, we approached a schooner, likely a trader from its appearance. As we got closer, the schooner attempted to escape, but we were faster. We raised British colors, but they didn't respond. Our captain fired a shot across their bow, revealing a hidden brass gun.

They were part of a native missionary ship carrying cargo like coconuts, pigs, and cats, along with the Gospel. Despite the crew's initial laughter, the captain treated the missionary kindly. The captain's actions were explained as a strategic move to ensure safe trade by respecting islands where the Gospel had been introduced.

Springing up the ladder, I quickly climbed to the cabin, thinking about the impact of the Gospel on savage natures as described by the men. Once back on deck, I found Bloody Bill at the helm, and attempted to engage him in conversation. He shared that the ship trades when possible but resorts to force when needed. He also mentioned the captain's favor towards missionaries as they help tame the brutal South Sea Islanders. Our journey took us through clusters of islets, where we faced dangers from both natives and coral reefs. One day, while seeking water on an uninhabited island, we were attacked by natives, prompting a fierce response from our crew. Despite the violence, we managed to fill our water casks and swiftly sailed away, haunted by the brutal events that unfolded.|"['1.

As I gazed at the captain, who stood smoking a cigar with indifference as we passed the green islets, I pondered his favoritism towards missionaries. I wondered if any missionary could tame him. I planned to escape the pirate ship at the next island, despite the horrors I witnessed. When I shared my plan with Bloody Bill, he warned me about the dangers of the islands. He spoke of the Feejee Islanders' gruesome practices, revealing the harsh reality of survival in those parts. Bill recounted a chilling tale of a ruthless trader who killed shipwreck survivors for food. His stories painted a grim picture of the islands, making me reconsider my escape plan.

Bill, a sailor on the ship, shared a plan with Ralph to escape the dangers they faced. He suggested that they could run away to islands near Tahiti where the natives were Christians and less hostile. Another option was to cut the boat adrift during their watch at night and escape. However, this plan carried the risk of being caught by the natives. As Ralph pondered his situation, a sudden red blaze on the horizon and a shower of ashes interrupted his thoughts. The ship sailed away from a distant volcano, leaving a thick coat of ashes on the decks. Soon after, they encountered a lush island with two tall mountains and a river flowing down to the sandy shore. Bill mentioned that the island was known for sandalwood but warned of the natives' growing distrust due to past encounters.|"[""1.

We quickly sailed into the coral-reef barrier and dropped anchor in six fathoms of water near a small creek lined with mangroves and tall trees. The main village was a short distance away. The captain led a well-armed group ashore, including me. We were warmly greeted by Romata, the island's chief, who hosted us in his house. After a feast, we discussed trade terms. Romata, forgetting past misunderstandings, promised full support. The next day, Romata introduced us to a visiting chief, who marveled at our ship's equipment. We demonstrated the ship's power by firing a gun, impressing Romata. The chief was intrigued by the gun's strength. Romata's grand appearance, with a distinctive beard and elaborate hair, caught our attention. The visit ended with mutual respect and a display of our ship's capabilities.|"[""1.

Romata was pleased with his successful shot and asked the captain to fire at a man on the shore, thinking his permission was enough. The captain refused, causing surprise and annoyance. The crew went to cut sandalwood, while Romata's visitor was fascinated by the ship's pump. He spent the day pumping water and even sent for his stool to sit comfortably. The crew encountered native houses in the woods and were escorted by the chief's men. The chief later arrived with food, and I learned about their customs, like the _tabu_. Bill explained the different races on the island, including light-skinned people from Tongan Islands. We saw a huge eel in a pond after a native boy summoned it with a whistle.|"['1.

"""There!"" exclaimed Bill, his lip twisted in disgust. ""What do you think of that as a god, Ralph? This is one of their gods, and it's been fed with many living babies already. How many more it'll consume before it perishes is uncertain.""""Babies,"" added Bill. ""Your kind-hearted folks back home would exclaim, 'Oh, terrible! impossible!' to that, and then walk away as if their words had made it untrue. But I tell you, Ralph, it's a _fact_.

As we walked back, I asked Bill for more details on this matter.""The mothers _do_ it! There seems to be no limit to the evil these people commit.

The next day, I joined the wood-cutting group once more as they went ashore. During lunchtime, I strolled into the woods alone, not feeling hungry. As I wandered, I unexpectedly reached the sea-shore after crossing a narrow strip of land dividing the village from a vast bay. There, I found islanders working on a war-canoe, nearly ready for launch. The canoe was impressively long, measuring a hundred feet and spacious enough for three hundred men. Intrigued, I watched as they fastened the parts together similar to how Jack did with our boat. Nearby, children played games on the beach. One group played a game like blind man's buff, while others walked on stilts. Some girls opened their eyes wide with straw between their lids, a strange sight. Despite the odd games, the children seemed joyful and carefree.|"['1.

Bill explained to Ralph how the natives' love for the sea led them to invent a thrilling game of surfing on the surf. Each person swam out with a short board, riding the thundering breakers back to the shore. The swimmers, resembling black seals, braved the waves with excitement. Tararo, a familiar face from the Coral Island, surprised Ralph. As they conversed, Tararo revealed the story of Avatea, a Samoan woman captured in war and kept as Tararo's daughter. Her refusal to marry a chief led to a dire ultimatum. Suddenly, a shark attack unfolded, sending shockwaves through the onlookers. The tragic event underscored the dangers lurking in the waters.|['1.

In many countries, such a scene would have deeply affected the onlookers. However, the islanders swiftly left the sea, fearing a similar fate for themselves. Their disregard for human life did not pause their activities. Surf-swimming abruptly ended, but they resumed other games immediately. Bill explained that sharks rarely attack due to the noise and numbers in the water. Despite witnessing a shark attack, the islanders continued their activities unfazed. The natives engaged in wrestling and boxing matches, causing injuries due to their lack of technique. The spectators applauded as the combatants fought fiercely. The chiefs and men displayed intricate tattoo designs on their bodies, showcasing their culture. The process of tattooing was described as painful and elaborate, starting at a young age. The women had fewer tattoos than the men, but it was noted that the practice reduced their appearance of nakedness. The passage also depicted a chief's violent outburst under the influence of alcohol, highlighting the dangers of intoxication.|['1.

"As we made our way to the beach, a horrifying scene unfolded before us. Men, seemingly indifferent or contemptuous, carried out a brutal act of violence. Witnessing this callousness towards bloodshed troubled me deeply. Reflecting on how exposure to such brutality was desensitizing me, I realized the natives and pirates around me had grown accustomed to such horrors. Even Bill, known as ""Bloody,"" displayed a fierce nature. Feeling helpless, I prayed for deliverance. The captain, embroiled in conflicts, sent me to offer a gift to Romata. Despite my surprise at the modest gift's value, I complied. At Romata's house, we witnessed a disturbing procession of bound captives, further revealing the savagery around us.

During the rest of the day, I felt like I was in a bad dream. I barely understood what was being said to me and got scolded by the men for not working. Finally, it was time to go back on the ship. We walked down to the beach, and I felt relieved when I stepped back onto the schooner's deck. Later that evening, I overheard a conversation between the captain and the first mate that surprised me. They were talking quietly in the cabin, but I could hear everything through the skylight. The mate suggested leaving without the others, but the captain disagreed. He had a plan to scare the villagers and take what they needed. Bill, the mate, also had a secret plan to warn the village without getting caught. As midnight approached, the men cut the cable and rowed up a creek. They reached the shore quietly and prepared for their mission.|"[""1.

The leader agreed and instructed me to be ready with the boat-hook to either push the boat to shore if needed or to move away if the savages returned. With anxiety, I waited to see the outcome. I knew where the gun was hidden, but there was no sound. Suddenly, a click and sparks appeared. The trigger had been pulled, but the gun didn't fire. Fear crept in as I stood in the boat, waiting in the dark. Shots were fired, and chaos ensued as our men clashed with the savages. The battle sounds grew louder, and I heard the savages approaching from behind. Our men were overwhelmed, and a sense of dread enveloped me. I considered fleeing but was frozen in fear. Just then, a crew member's agonizing scream pierced the air, followed by savage shouts. The scene was chaotic, and as I prepared to push off, a man emerged from the bushes.|['1.

"""Stop! Ralph, stop! Push off!"" Bill shouted as he leaped into the boat, nearly tipping it over. With a forceful stroke, Bill began rowing, propelling the boat down the creek. Suddenly, a horde of savages on the bank noticed their escape. One powerful man managed to board the boat, but Bill swiftly knocked him overboard. As more savages closed in, Bill fired the cannon, creating chaos and allowing them to sail to safety.

I gazed gratefully as I took a sip, then my head drooped heavily on my arm, and I dozed off. When I woke, the sun was high, and I savored the tranquility.

I felt deep regret and guilt for neglecting my Bible, realizing I was a greater sinner than the pirate I encountered. Despite being taught to read the Bible by my mother, I couldn't recall a single verse to comfort the pirate. Distressed, I searched my memory until a text finally came to mind. The pirate, Bill, shared his troubled past as a sailor turned pirate, feeling his fate was sealed. He emphasized the challenge of truly believing, likening it to trusting a rope over a precipice. As a squall approached, I hurried to adjust the sails, and the storm hit us with force. The schooner battled the waves, and I struggled to keep control as Bill was knocked unconscious. Despite the chaos, I steered the vessel through the storm until the squall passed, leaving us in the midst of the turbulent sea.|"['1.

When my shipmate, Bill, succumbed to his injuries, I was filled with sorrow and fear. Alone in the vast Pacific Ocean, my knowledge of navigation limited, and the schooner requiring a full crew, I felt the weight of my predicament. Despite my grief, I tied a cannon-ball to Bill's feet and gave him a solemn burial at sea. As I sailed westward, a steady breeze aided my progress. Although I lacked the captain's quadrant for navigation, I relied on dead reckoning to guide me towards the Coral Island.

In a hurry, I fetched seawater on board to examine its unusual glow. The mysterious light vanished near the lamp but reappeared when the lamp was removed. I discovered a phosphoric substance on my hand that shone in the dark. Upon close inspection, I found clear jelly-like patches. These patches were likely from animals, similar to jellyfish. On the fourteenth day, I was awakened by a cry to witness a majestic albatross flying above. The sight brought me joy and a sense of companionship.

All was set. A steady breeze blew as I neared the reef. Sailing through the entrance, memories of bidding farewell to the island flooded me. Anchoring near the Water Garden, I fired the gun, startling Peterkin and Jack. They dashed away but recognized my voice, rushing back. Overjoyed, we embraced in the sea, laughing and sputtering.

The islands in the Pacific can be classified into three types. The first type is volcanic, with tall, rugged peaks reaching heights of up to fifteen thousand feet. The second type is made of crystallised limestone, with hills ranging from one hundred to five hundred feet, covered in lush vegetation. The Coral Island where the group was shipwrecked likely belonged to this category. The third type consists of low coralline islands, often featuring lagoons. During their stay, the missionaries shared fascinating stories, including one about a cat brought to the island to control the rat population. The cat's escapades, including scaring locals and being mistaken for a supernatural being, provided amusement.

Coral islands and reefs are formed through a fascinating process involving coral insects called polypes. These insects attract lime from the saltwater to build their tiny cells or homes. They prefer to work near the surface, often choosing the summit of a volcano or the top of an underwater mountain as a foundation. As they work, the insects at the mountain's top reach the surface first, followed by those at the outer edges, forming coral reefs around lagoons of water and central islands. Once the surface is reached, the insects die, and birds bring seeds that grow into lush vegetation. The missionary shared this explanation, also recounting the challenges faced when introducing Christianity to the islanders. Despite initial hostility, the missionary persevered, eventually leading to the conversion of the chief's son to Christianity.|"['1.

The teacher shared a remarkable story with us about the Feejee Islanders. In their tradition, when the chief grows old, the heir can depose him and bury him alive. Despite the shocking customs, the teacher's prayers led the tribe to embrace Christianity. The son, now chief, burned their idols, symbolizing their conversion.

"As he spoke, I turned suddenly and saw the men nearby, all lifeless. They were tied with ropes, sitting on planks, staring blankly and grinning at the crew below. They were the fallen soldiers from the battle the day before, destined for a ritual sacrifice. Following them was a man, seemingly indifferent to his fate. We reached a circular temple surrounded by bones and skulls. Inside, a priest with knives dissected bodies. A ""dan-vosa"" scolded the dead. The bodies were baked in a fire pit. Next, a man was buried alive as part of a gruesome dedication ceremony. The crowd then prepared to erect a house frame, leaving us horrified yet unable to turn away.

When we got back to the shore and told our friend what had happened, he was upset. Tararo then arrived with his followers carrying baskets of food. Jack insisted that Avatea, a Samoan girl, should be allowed to follow her wishes and join the Christians. Tararo refused, as he had promised to send the girl to someone else. Jack threatened to use a gun from his ship to destroy the village if Avatea was not released. Suddenly, Avatea appeared, and Jack fiercely defended her. A confrontation was about to happen when the teacher intervened, preventing a fight. Tararo agreed to spare Jack's life but kept the schooner. The teacher encouraged Jack not to lose hope and to find a way to free Avatea from slavery. Jack was determined to act despite feeling helpless.|"[""1.

The teacher advised Jack to be patient and submissive to ensure success. Jack eagerly listened to the teacher's plans to help him get the girl on board the schooner. The teacher warned Jack about the dangers involved in the plan. They discussed a risky but necessary plan to take Avatea to a Christian island for her safety. The teacher suggested abandoning the schooner to deceive the savages and safely transport Avatea. They planned to meet Avatea that night to finalize the escape.

"Jack responded, ""I have counted it. If Avatea agrees to take the risk, I will, and so will my friends. Besides,"" Jack continued, looking earnestly at the teacher, ""the Bible, our Bible, speaks of someone who rescues those who call upon Him in times of trouble, who controls the winds and the waters."" We began preparing for the voyage, gathering supplies and placing provisions on deck to last several weeks. We planned to load the canoe with as much as it could carry safely and quickly. Covered with a tarpaulin, we intended to move them to the canoe shortly before departure. As night fell, we knelt with the natives and the teacher for a blessing on our journey. Quietly rowing to the shore, we followed a guide to the meeting point, where Avatea joined us. After explaining our plans in detail, we set a rendezvous at the cliff for the next night. We rowed back to the schooner quietly, fearing our intentions might be discovered. The following day, we strolled around the village, trying to appear casual.

Peterkin's amusing idea made me smile, but I feared the consequences if the food went down the wrong throat. When I mentioned this to him, Peterkin jokingly retorted, saying it couldn't be the wrong throat if it was Avatea's. Jack, quietly calling Peterkin a villain, shared some food with him. As we paddled away in the canoe, Jack noticed land ahead, giving us hope of escape. However, our hopes were dashed when the supposed land turned out to be a fog bank. Despite the disappointment, we paddled with renewed determination. Eventually, we had to face the pursuing savages, resigning ourselves to our fate. The imminent danger spurred us on, even in the face of despair, until we could paddle no more and had to confront our pursuers.|"[""1.

Silently, Jack, with a determined expression, raised a boat-oar in defiance. Peterkin, holding the other oar, showed no anger. Avatea looked sad. As the war-canoe approached, the savages readied their spears. The canoe struck us, throwing us into the sea. Bound in the large canoe, we endured the scorching sun without water or food. Upon landing, we were taken to Tararo's hut. Jack expressed regret for his actions. We were then led to a cave and left in darkness. Jack admitted his fault, hoping the teacher could help.

Suddenly, the barricade at the cave entrance was removed, and three men came in, taking us away through the forest. We heard drums and shouting in the village, thinking we were headed back to Tararo's hut. Instead, we were led to the temple where people were sacrificed.

In my life, there were times of deep sorrow and darkness that felt endless. We were confined, fearing execution. As time passed, the longing for freedom grew, and despair set in. We dreamt of home but found ourselves in a gloomy cave. Peterkin's once cheerful voice was now filled with sadness. The Bible's comforting words were missed. Peterkin wept, and we sat in silence. Suddenly, our jailer freed us. At first, we feared the worst, but we were set free. The teacher, moved to tears, shared the news of our freedom and the village's conversion to Christianity.

We were amazed by the sight before us. We had been trapped in a dark cave for so long, dreaming of freedom, that we hesitated to believe this was real and not just another dream. The bright sunlight blinded us, overwhelming our senses. As we followed our guide, the vibrant colors of the trees, the sounds of parrots, and the sweet scents of flowers confirmed our deliverance. Tears of joy filled our eyes as we cheered loudly. Nearby natives greeted us warmly, leading us to Tararo's home. The scene was unforgettable. The chief sat with a teacher and an English missionary. The missionary's kind eyes and warm smile welcomed us. Tararo explained that the Gospel had brought us freedom. We were offered provisions and the chance to leave on our schooner.
