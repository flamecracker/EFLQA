"Poets have long been admirers of nature, helping us to appreciate the beauty that surrounds us.

From the frost that freezes rivers to the awakening of spring, nature's wonders are all around us.

"Mr. Prideaux asked, ""Was it your dog that troubled my dog last night when he was on a mission of trust? My dog had a guinea to carry to my friend, and instead of dropping it, he endured being injured by your dog, Tiger. Today, my dog has shown his bravery, and yours has realized his error. This is the guinea he dropped when he returned to me after midnight, hurt and upset!"" Excited, Mr. Prideaux continued, ""Here, Turk, take the guinea again, and let's go!

"Ernest Harold Baynes, a naturalist-author from Meriden, New Hampshire, had a bear named Jimmy who loved to entertain children. Despite Jimmy's playful antics, he sometimes got a bit rough, like during a boxing match with a girl. The children enjoyed playing with Jimmy until he accidentally slapped one of them too hard. As the evening wound down, Jimmy was led back to his den under the porch. Baynes, who also wrote about birds and animals during World War I, organized bird clubs to protect wild birds. Questions for discussion include why Jimmy wasn't popular with the farmer's wife, why the children liked the bear, and how the party might have been different without the ""uninvited guest."" Students can practice silent reading by summarizing Jimmy's actions at the party and the boxing match. Additional bear stories can be found in various books mentioned in the passage."|[]|[]
In the autumn of 1889, I learned that a few bison remained near the head of Wisdom River. I journeyed there and searched diligently, finding plenty of other game but no trace of the bison. Surprisingly, a few days later, I unexpectedly encountered these magnificent beasts in Idaho, just south of the Montana border and about twenty-five miles west of Wyoming. While hunting for moose and sheep with a companion suffering from rheumatism, we stumbled upon a breathtaking valley encircled by steep mountains. Following fresh bison tracks, we tracked them to a tranquil lake where they grazed peacefully before venturing into the forest. After a cautious pursuit through the woods, we finally spotted the bison herd, waiting for the majestic bull to appear before taking action.|"['1.

"Discussion: In the poem, the day is called a ""new day"" because it brings opportunities for fresh starts and new beginnings. The lines that suggest the day will pass quickly remind us to make the most of our time and not waste it. The poet encourages us to ""think"" in the first stanza, prompting us to reflect on our actions and choices. These same lines are repeated in another stanza to emphasize the importance of thoughtful contemplation. In the short story about Titus, he regrets not helping anyone, feeling like he lost a day. This aligns with the poet's idea of not letting a day go to waste.

I cherish her forests, dark and secluded, For there the wild bird's joyful song I hear from dawn till dusk; And there are more beautiful flowers, I believe, Than ever in Eastern lands were seen, In diverse, vivid colors. Her forests and her fair valleys, Her flowers that perfume the morning breeze-- All have their attractions for me; But most of all, I love my country's name, Those words that resonate with eternal glory, ""The Land of Liberty.""

Legends about a national hero have been passed down among common people. One of the oldest collections of tales is the Arabian Nights, filled with enchanting stories of treasure-filled caves and magical palaces. These stories were initially told in desert tents and bustling bazaars before being written down. The Arabian Nights Entertainment captivated a cruel King, who planned to harm the women in his kingdom. His wife saved them by telling captivating stories for a thousand and one nights. Another famous hero is Robin Hood, known for his archery contests and battles against unjust laws. Unlike Arabian Nights, Robin Hood's tales focus on his fights in the greenwood.

In a desolate state, I was filled with sorrow, regretting my past decisions. Climbing a tall tree in despair, I scanned the horizon for a glimmer of hope. Spotting a distant white structure on land, I gathered my remaining provisions and made my way towards it. As I drew closer, I realized it was a massive white dome. The sudden darkness that fell was due to a colossal bird, the roc, guarding its egg within the dome. Tying myself to the bird's leg, I hoped it would carry me away from the island. The next morning, the roc took flight with me, soaring high before swiftly descending, causing me to lose consciousness. Upon waking, I untied myself, only to witness the roc flying off with a serpent in its beak. Surrounded by mountains, I found a valley scattered with diamonds, realizing the tales of the valley of diamonds were true. Determined to escape, I devised a plan using the diamonds and a piece of meat to be carried by an eagle to a merchant's nest. Upon reaching the nest, the merchant, initially alarmed, eventually accepted my offer of diamonds, content with one gem that would secure his fortune.|"[""1.

Little John delivered the King's seal to the Sheriff, who welcomed them as messengers from the King. They were treated to a feast, and when the Sheriff fell asleep, the two outlaws snuck to the prison. They overpowered the guard, found Robin Hood, and freed him. Little John led Robin to safety over the city wall. Robin offered to make Little John the leader of their group, but he only wanted to remain a comrade. Meanwhile, the King, angered by Robin's actions, planned to capture him with his Knights. However, an old Knight advised the King to be cautious. Despite Robin's elusive nature, the King eventually encountered him in the forest. Robin demanded charity from the King, who invited them to Nottingham.

"The King hesitated. ""I should not strike such a strong man,"" he said. But Robin urged him on. The King rolled up his sleeve and delivered a powerful blow to Robin's head, causing him to tumble to the ground. The King then asked Robin if he had any green cloth to sell. Robin provided thirty yards, dressing the King and his men in Lincoln green. They cheerfully rode to Nottingham, causing fear among the townspeople. They thought Robin might harm the King. However, the King reassured them and they celebrated. After some time, Robin felt homesick. He sought permission from the King to go on a pilgrimage. The King granted him seven nights.

"My name is Lemuel Gulliver, and I hail from Nottinghamshire. I attended Cambridge University to study diligently, as my father's wealth was modest. To secure my future, I pursued a career in medicine and also honed my skills as a sailor. After marrying, I served as a ship's surgeon on voyages, including one aboard the Antelope bound for the South Sea. During a storm near Van Diemen's Land, our ship wrecked, and I, along with six sailors, rowed away in a small boat. Exhausted, we were capsized by another gust of wind. I swam to safety, washed ashore on an uninhabited island, where I woke to find myself tied down by tiny creatures. Bewildered, I was greeted by their cries of ""Hekinah degul!"" in what seemed like admiration."|"['1.

During my time with the tiny people, I felt great discomfort. After a struggle, I managed to free my left arm and turn my head slightly. The little folks ran off, shouting loudly. Suddenly, a shower of arrows pricked me, causing much pain. Despite wearing a leather waistcoat that protected me, the onslaught continued. I lay still, hoping for nightfall to escape. When I signaled hunger, they brought me food. The Emperor of these small beings appeared, indicating I was to be taken to their capital city.

They began to construct a large wooden frame, raised slightly from the ground, resembling a bed frame in size. Five hundred workers readied this contraption to transport me to the city. After much commotion, they faced the challenge of lifting me onto it. Eighty poles were driven into the ground, acting as support. I was then secured with bandages and hooks attached to cords, pulled up by strong men using pulleys. Eventually, I was hoisted onto the machine and tied securely. The Emperor's horses, each about four inches tall, pulled the machine towards the city gates. Upon arrival, the Emperor and his court greeted us. They led me to an old temple where I was to reside. The temple had small windows and chains fastened to my leg with padlocks. The Emperor and his nobles observed me from a turret. Despite the onlookers, the Emperor restricted further climbing on me.

The Empress, young princes, and nobles gathered around the Emperor to watch me eat. He was taller than the rest, standing about my nail's breadth above them. Handsome and dignified, he reigned victoriously for seven years. His plain attire included a gold helmet with jewels and a plume. Holding a small, diamond-adorned sword, he stood guard while I ate. The court departed after two hours, leaving soldiers to protect me. One man shot an arrow at me, narrowly missing my eye.

Once upon a time in the land of Lilliput, there was a brave foreigner who had earned his freedom from the Emperor, despite the efforts of his enemy, General Skyresh. This foreigner was approached by a noble named Reldresal, who revealed a grave threat: the neighboring island of Blefuscu was preparing to invade Lilliput. The Emperor trusted the foreigner's abilities and sought his help in defending their land. The foreigner devised a clever plan to defeat the enemy's fleet using ropes and iron bars. With courage and skill, he swam to the enemy ships and caused such a fright that the Blefuscudians abandoned their vessels and fled. The Emperor was grateful for the foreigner's bravery and resourcefulness, proving himself a valuable servant of Lilliput.|"['1.

I used my hooks and ropes to attach a hook to each ship and then tied all the ropes together. While doing this, the enemy shot many arrows at me, causing some to stick in my face and hands. I was hurt and slowed down by the pain. I was most worried about my eyes, so I put on my spectacles to protect them. With my glasses on, I continued working despite the arrows hitting me. After cutting the anchors of the ships, I was able to pull fifty vessels with ease. The Emperor of Lilliput was amazed by my feat and wanted me to bring more enemy ships. I refused, stating it would be unfair to enslave a brave people. This angered the Emperor, leading to ill feelings towards me. Eventually, peace was made with Blefuscu, and their messengers thanked me for my fairness and invited me to their island.|"['1.

The next time I saw our Emperor, I asked to visit Blefuscu, which he allowed but seemed displeased by. The Blefuscudians are tiny, about six inches tall, with animals even smaller. Their laws differ from ours but are fair. Lying is punished severely, deceit is worse than theft, and promises must be kept. Good behavior is rewarded, and the Emperor values bravery and honesty over intelligence. Despite the good laws, the Emperor didn't treat me well after I helped him. To accommodate me, they made a large table and chair and sewed clothes from the island's strongest linen. The tailors measured me uniquely, and the cooks prepared my meals, which were served by many attendants. Meat portions were huge, and I once had a sirloin so big it took three bites.|"[""1.

I was getting ready to visit the Emperor of Blefuscu as promised when a Lilliputian noble visited me secretly. He looked anxious and troubled, revealing a plot against me by Skyresh and other nobles who accused me of treason. They planned to put me to death, but the Emperor decided to spare my life and have my eyes put out instead. Reldresal, my true friend, suggested mercy due to my past services. However, the other nobles, especially Skyresh, were adamant about my punishment. The plan was to starve me and then blind me by shooting sharp arrows into my eyes.

I almost decided to use my strength to overpower the Lilliputians and destroy their city with stones. However, I felt it was unfair and dishonorable to break my promise not to harm the island.

One day, I found myself stranded on an island after my ship wrecked. I quickly set up a makeshift nest on a tree to sleep in and made a stick to ward off predators. When I woke up, the ship had drifted closer to the shore. I swam to the wreck and found it leaking. I scavenged for food and supplies, then decided to build a raft to transport my findings. I used spare ship parts and created a sturdy raft. With the help of oars I found, I navigated the raft to shore, battling the wind.

After I found a stone to grind my tools on, bags of nails, spikes, saws, knives, and other useful items in the tool chest on the ship, I decided to bring them to shore before a storm destroyed the ship. I built a tent with spare sails to store my goods and made poles from wood. I arranged casks around the tent for support and slept inside on one of the beds from the ship. I felt lonely and cut off from the world but kept busy fetching items from the wreck each day. During one trip, I found some tea and gold coins, which I decided to keep. I also built a secure home with a fence and a cave in the sand rock nearby. I marked the days on a post to keep track of time and had four loyal pets: two cats, a dog, and a parrot. My dog was a great companion, always ready to help, and my pets were my only friends in this lonely place.|"['1.

I lived far from any ship routes, feeling lonely without loved ones to share laughter, tears, or thoughts. Roaming from the woods to the shore, I dwelled on my solitude. Yet, being safe on land while the crew was lost had its bright side. The island lacked dangerous beasts, and I salvaged supplies from the wreck. I expanded my cave to store the goods, turning it into a home. Crafting shelves, a table, and a chair, I transformed it into a cozy space. Working diligently, I improved my shelter but faced challenges like the roof caving in. To prevent mishaps, I built a wooden roof. I used a lamp for light, grew grains from husks, and cultivated fruits. After a year, I explored the island, discovering fruitful lands and clear streams.|['1.

Living on the isolated island, I found solace in the serene vale devoid of sea views. Despite the challenges, I toiled to make bread from scratch, fashioning tools from wood. Threshing grain, I yearned for sieves and a mill. My makeshift methods led to a hearty meal. Crafting pots from clay was comical, with some collapsing and cracking in the sun. The ship's boat, stranded on a sand ridge, taunted me. After futile attempts, I resolved to build a smaller boat. Eventually, equipped with sails and provisions, I embarked on a daring voyage around the isle. Navigating treacherous waters, I nearly met my end. Yet, my resilience and resourcefulness as the island's sovereign sustained me through the perils, fostering a spirit of ingenuity and self-reliance.|"['1.

Returning home after a long day on the boat, I rested under a tree and dozed off. I was startled awake by a voice calling my name thrice in the wilderness - it was Poll, my parrot, mimicking me. Determined to catch goats, I set traps with rice as bait, but they were empty come morning. So, I devised a pit trap and successfully caught some kids. However, the old goat was too fierce. I tamed the young goats by hand-feeding them in a park I built. Concerned they might grow wild, I reduced the park's size with a hedge. My attire, made from goat skins, was comical compared to city clothes. One day, I found a man's footprint on the shore, puzzling me deeply.|"['1.

Fear gripped me as I left the spot, taking cautious steps and glancing around. The stump of an old tree startled me, sending me running home in panic. How could a stranger reach the shore without my knowledge? The fear of being discovered haunted me, keeping me indoors for days until hunger forced me out. Venturing to the coast, I compared footprints, realizing men were on the island. A chilling sight of bones and a fire pit left me anxious. Spotting smoke nearby, dread consumed me, fearing discovery.

He led me to the northwest side of the island the next day. Familiar with the place, he recounted being there once with a dozen men. To illustrate, he lined up twelve stones for me to count. Assuring me that there was no danger and no boats were lost, he mentioned a tribe of white men with beards living far off where the moon rose, likely from Spain, working in gold mines. Curious, I asked if I could join them. I shared my life story with him, including my birthplace and childhood memories. I gifted him a knife and a belt, which thrilled him. Observing his longing gaze towards the distant land, I grew apprehensive. I worried he might return with his tribe to harm me. Despite my unfounded fears, I gradually distanced myself from him, questioning his desire to return home. He spoke of the kindness shown to some white men by his people, and we embarked on building a boat together. After two months of labor, we had a sturdy boat ready for the voyage.

"The following passage has been refined for middle school students using the provided vocabulary:

Our next task was to store our boat in the creek and build a small dock. When the tide was low, we made a dam to keep the sea out. As it was time to sail, we gathered our supplies to load onto the boat. One morning, my companion Friday rushed in, shouting, ""Master, they're here!"" I quickly got dressed and followed him through the thick woods to the shore. A boat with a sail was approaching, not from the direction of the shore but from the south end of the island. Unsure if they were friends or foes, I grabbed my spyglass and saw an English ship anchored nearby. The boat landed, and eleven Englishmen disembarked, taking three prisoners. Shocked, I prepared for a possible confrontation. As they rested in the woods, I cautiously approached them, offering help. They were surprised but relieved to find a friend in me."|['1.

Twenty-five men were sent to steal along the river bank on the opposite side, stationing themselves among the trees. Another group was to form a line connecting the two wings across the valley. Beatte, Antoine, and Tonish were to drive the horses forward into a circle formation. The flanking parties extended themselves out of sight on each side, while the rest formed a chain across the valley. The wild horses sensed danger and pranced off towards the river, disappearing behind a green bank. Unfortunately, a Frenchman on a Count's horse broke the chase system, leading to a chaotic pursuit. The horses dashed down the valley as the hunters galloped behind them. The chase continued with rangers and half-breeds joining in.

King Midas was a wise ruler who became so excited by his newfound wealth that even the palace seemed too small to contain his joy. As he descended the staircase, his touch turned the ordinary balustrade into gleaming gold. In the garden, he found beautiful roses in full bloom.

The child sat at the table, consumed with grief over the ruined roses, oblivious to the magic happening around her. The china bowl she usually admired was now a dull yellow, losing its intricate designs to the golden hue. Meanwhile, King Midas poured his coffee, only to find it turning into gold as he sipped. Even the trout on his plate transformed into a metallic fish when touched. The hot cakes and boiled eggs suffered the same fate, becoming inedible gold. Midas, perplexed and hungry, realized that his newfound ability to turn things into gold was more of a curse than a blessing.
