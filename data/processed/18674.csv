Ko-ai, Kwan-yu's daughter, felt anxious when she noticed her father's worried expression, recalling she had tried to dissuade him from the Emperor's task. She joined a loyal servant to pray at the temple. On the significant day, the Emperor and his court gathered, the Emperor seated on a special platform. As the room heated up, attendants fanned the Emperor, and an ice block cooled the air. Kwan-yu's wife and daughter, aware of the task's importance, watched nervously.

"Closer and closer approached the fiery ball. When it finally landed on the deck, to Ying-lo's surprise, something incredibly peculiar occurred. Just as he was about to be frightened, the light disappeared, and a peculiar little man appeared before him, peering into the child's scared face. ""Yes, you are the boy I seek,"" he eventually said in a high-pitched voice that nearly made Ying-lo chuckle. ""You are Ying-lo, the sole survivor of this unfortunate group."" Pointing towards the bodies scattered around the deck, the man continued speaking. The ship was now rocking violently, seeming like it might capsize at any moment. Not far off to the right, jagged rocks protruded from the water, waiting for the helpless ship. The newcomer slowly made his way to the mast and tapped it thrice with an iron staff he used as a cane. Instantly, the sails unfurled, the ship stabilized, and it swiftly sailed over the sea, leaving the seagulls far behind and the menacing rocks in the distance. ""Do you recall me?"" the stranger asked, approaching Ying-lo. However, his words were drowned out by the howling wind, and the boy could only see his lips moving. Bending down until his mouth was near Ying-lo's ear, the old man inquired, ""Have we met before?"" With a tap of his staff, the fairy ceased the gusts of wind and addressed his young companion once more. """|['1.
