"Robin's living space served multiple purposes. It was his parlour, dining-room, drawing-room, bedroom, and kitchen all rolled into one.

Robin shared this space with his wife, son Roy, who was twelve, and daughter Nelly, around eight.

In quietness, three hunters ventured into the dark woods near Fort Enterprise. Robin led the way, with Walter and Roy following his path. The father sank slightly with each step due to the snow, but the fine, dry snow fell through his snow-shoes like dust. Walter and Roy had an easier time walking in their footsteps. Walter, nearly as strong as his uncle, took turns leading every two hours. They journeyed through the woods, crossing frozen swamps and plains until noon, when they halted for a simple meal of dried meat and hot tea. They planned to check traps at Wolf's Glen and then head home for New Year's dinner. Meanwhile, Wapaw, a seasoned woodsman, neared Fort Enterprise, battling starvation and exhaustion.|"[""1.

Wapaw, a once strong and active man, found himself in a desolate plain on a bitter cold day. With no food or tobacco left, he prepared to face certain death. Despite the odds, he made a camp under a pine tree, lit a fire, and tried to find sustenance in his firebag. Exhausted and facing his mortality, he resorted to eating a portion of his leather bag mixed with snow. As he lay down, accepting his fate, a group led by Robin found him. They provided warmth, food, and tea, reviving Wapaw from the brink of death. The group, cautious of a possible war-party, prepared for any potential threat as they tended to Wapaw's needs.|"[""1.

The boy quickly returned with a flat wooden sledge used by trappers to transport their game. Wapaw, an Indian, was securely tied to the sledge and pulled by the hunters towards Fort Enterprise. Robin, the leader, reassured his companions that Wapaw was not likely to die and needed food. The group prepared for a New Year's feast with game provided by Robin. However, Wapaw warned of an imminent attack by his tribe to burn the fort and take captives. Robin, undeterred, prepared for the impending threat. Meanwhile, the children, Roy and Nelly, set out for a walk in the woods. Mrs. Gore busily prepared a lavish New Year's dinner, including dishes like cloudberry jam tart, salt goose, bear's ham, rabbits, and ptarmigan. As the storm intensified, Robin searched for the missing children, but they were nowhere to be found in the growing snow.|"['1.

At the end of the day, dinner was served, waiting for Robin to return with the children. Robin came back, and Walter and Larry quickly geared up in warm coats, fur hats, and snowshoes to join Mrs. Gore, who anxiously waited for them. Roy and Nelly, feeling adventurous, decided to explore further than usual. As they wandered, the snowstorm intensified, making it hard to see. Despite the snow, they laughed and enjoyed their time, until Roy accidentally triggered a snowfall from a tree. Unharmed, they continued until Roy's snowshoe broke. Lost in the snow, they struggled to find their way back, facing challenges with the deep snow and broken equipment. Eventually, they found their way back, tired but relieved, after a challenging adventure in the winter wilderness.|"['1.

"""Come on, don't worry, Nell,"" Roy comforted gently, ""Let's camp in the snow! We've done it near the house for fun before, so now we'll do it seriously."" Nelly, shivering, said, ""But it's dark and cold, and I'm so hungry! What should we do?"" Roy, trying to be brave, said, ""Don't lose hope. Father will search for us. Let's make a camp, light a fire, and wait."" Building a snow shelter wasn't new to the kids. They dug a hole, made a soft bed of pine branches, and lit a fire. The flames warmed them, making the snow walls sparkle like gems. They forgot their worries, enjoying the fire's comfort. Meanwhile, Robin searched desperately. Night fell, and the hunters returned to Fort Enterprise to prepare for a thorough search.

"A Native American chief named Hawk, a clever but wicked man, suspected Wapaw's quick departure from their camp alone. Hawk, influential among his people, convinced them to attack the ""pale-faces"" fort the next day. Traveling faster, they almost caught up with Wapaw. They camped near the fort, ready to attack. Hawk warned his group that if Wapaw reached the fort first, they should retreat. They set out before dawn. Hawk noticed a distant fire and led his group towards it. They found two children, Roy and Nelly, asleep near the fire and shivering from the cold. Hawk woke them abruptly. The group debated what to do with the children. Roy, unable to understand the Indians, mentioned Wapaw. The Indians questioned Roy, who tried to signal that Wapaw was hungry but now safe.

After some talk, they stood up to leave, motioning for the children to rise and follow. Roy showed his damaged snowshoe, but Hawk solved the issue by discarding it and having him wear his sister's. A strong warrior carried Nelly on his back, and they departed, led by their chief. Initially, the children cooperated, thinking they were being taken to the Fort. However, their dismay grew as they were led in the opposite direction through the woods. Roy hesitated but was prodded by an Indian, realizing escape was futile. Nelly, unable to communicate with her brother, cried on the warrior's shoulder. Despite the storm erasing their trail, the tribe continued their journey, with Roy's snowshoes repaired and Nelly walking more.

Spring arrived suddenly in the region where the wanderers found themselves. One night, the temperature rose significantly above freezing, and the next day, all the signs of Nature awakening were evident. The air felt warm against their cheeks, carrying the scents of greenery. Roy and Nelly absorbed the refreshing atmosphere, akin to a thirsty traveler finding an oasis. However, amidst this beauty, war loomed as enemies descended upon their tribe. Scouts brought alarming news, prompting preparations for battle. Roy decided they should flee to safety, back to Fort Enterprise. Nelly, though anxious, trusted Roy's judgment.

Roy and Nelly journeyed through the wilderness, guided by the pole-star at night and the sun by day. Despite many miles traveled, Fort Enterprise remained unseen. They cautiously avoided signs of Indians and trekked through the unknown land. One day, as frost set in, they glimpsed a beautiful lake reflecting the sky's splendor. The serene scene uplifted their spirits. Roy proposed a break to replenish supplies and rest. Nelly agreed, trusting her brother's judgment.

With quick steps and excited expressions, Roy and his sister hurried down to the edge of Silver Lake to set up their camp. The sunny area they chose was perfect, sloping gently towards the lake with a beach of white pebbles and sheltered by trees. Roy noticed the nearby rocks could serve as a jetty for his raft. The grass was soft for their night's rest, and a stream from a hillside spring flowed nearby. The lake was teeming with wildlife - geese, ducks, swans, and plover. Deer came to drink, and the air was filled with the sounds of nature. Roy quickly built a hut with fir branches and poles, while his sister helped. They enjoyed their dinner by the fire and settled down under the stars for a peaceful night's sleep. Sunrise the next day brought a sense of joy and new beginnings.|['1.

Nelly Gore woke up to a breathtaking sight of the sun's golden rays flooding the valley, turning Silver Lake into a shimmering gold. Roy, startled by the beauty, mistook Nelly's excitement for danger. Roy, armed with a new bow and arrows, set out to hunt. His first attempts were unsuccessful due to the elusive ducks and geese by the lake. Opting for the woods, Roy encountered a tree-grouse. Despite a clumsy fall, Roy managed to stun the bird with a blunt arrow. North American grouse are known to be naive and easily shot if aimed at the lowest bird in a group.

Roy demonstrated his skill with a bow and arrow, successfully bagging five birds in a row. Rather than excessive hunting, he aimed to provide food for a few days. As he headed home to help his sister, his thoughts wandered from the wilderness to the settlements and even to Silver Lake. Roy's mind was a whirlwind of ideas, jumping from one topic to another. Along the way, he mused about his mother, the noisy ducks, and his successful archery. His sister praised his inventive plan, which he credited to their father's reading. Roy lamented their lack of books, wishing they had access to more reading material.|"['1.

Roy and his sister were avid readers, taught by their mother from the Bible, the only book they had in the wilderness. While Roy and his sister enjoyed reading, others like Walter and Larry couldn't read. Mrs. Gore wanted more books, but her husband believed the Bible was enough. The small library led to more Bible reading. However, the young ones craved fairy tales and adventures. Roy had a special reed basket made by Nelly. He used it to hide in the water and approach ducks. Nelly watched anxiously until Roy startled a duck with the basket, followed by the duck's mother. The mother duck was surprised as she was pulled underwater. Nelly was amazed by the scene, filled with joy.|"['1.

"When the bundle moved towards the father of the duck-family, that gentleman became agitated and suspicious. Probably males are less trusting than females, in all conditions of animal life. At all events he sheered off. The bundle waxed impatient and made a rush at him. The drake, missing his wife and child, quacked the alarm. The bundle made another rush, and suddenly disappeared with a tremendous splash, in the midst of which a leg and an arm appeared! Away went the whole brood of ducks with immense splutter, and Nelly gave a wild scream of terror, supposing--and she was right--that her brother had fallen into a hole, and that he would be drowned. In the latter supposition, however, she was mistaken, for Roy swam ashore in a few moments with a duck in each hand!

Roy and Nelly had feasted heartily, and had piled wood on the fire so high that the hut was comparatively warm, and they slept soundly till morning: but, about sunrise, the fire having died out, they both awoke shivering with cold. Being _very_ sleepy, they tried for some time to drop off again in spite of the cold. Failing in this, Roy at last jumped up with vigour and said he would light the fire, but he had scarcely issued from the hut, when a shout brought Nelly in alarm and haste to his side.

Roy and Nelly, being children, decided to make the most of the situation. They tested the ice on the lake, ran around, and attempted to slide but struggled due to their soft shoes. Roy then crafted wooden soles for both of them, improving their ability to slide on the ice. With the new invention, Roy glided across the ice surface with joy. They then tried fishing, catching various fish by cutting a hole in the ice and using a fishing line. They prepared the fish for later use. Excited about the snowfall, Roy planned to hunt for deer before their journey. Nelly would repair the snowshoes and sled lashings. They were ready to embark on their adventure the next day.|['1.

During their challenging journey, Roy and his sister Nelly lost track of the days of the week but decided to set their own Sabbath day to rest and reflect. Roy, being the philosopher he was, reminded Nelly of the commandment to work six days and rest on the seventh. They resolved to travel for six days and observe the seventh as their Sabbath. As they lay down to sleep one night, a snowstorm hit their hut, covering them in snow. Roy, ever the optimist, sprang into action, tightening his belt and preparing to face the storm. Despite the fierce winds and snow, Roy and Nelly, accustomed to the wilderness, faced the storm with courage and determination. Roy led Nelly outside to witness the powerful spectacle of Silver Lake in the storm, showcasing their resilience and adaptability in the face of nature's challenges.|"['1.

Silver Lake shimmered under the silver light, with snowflakes swirling like waves on a stormy sea. The chaos was so intense that it blurred the boundaries between land, water, and sky. Despite appearances, there is no disorder in God's plan. Common sense and science confirm this truth. Nelly and Roy, lost in the snow, focused on survival. They battled smoke-filled huts and falling snow, creating a makeshift shelter to weather the storm. As they reminisced about home and their mother, they repaired their gear and set snares for rabbits. Roy even devised a trap for a bear he encountered. The siblings worked together, resourceful and determined, as they faced the challenges of the wilderness.|"[""1.

Roy woke up the next morning from a dream about bears, feeling tired but excited. He remembered setting snares for rabbits and decided to check them. As he walked through the woods, he spotted a deer. Startled, he shot it successfully. Continuing his journey, he found most of his snares had caught rabbits. Excited by his good luck, he headed towards a bear-trap he had set. To his surprise, he found a live bear caught in it. Without time to reload his gun, Roy used his axe to fight the bear. After a fierce battle, he managed to defeat the bear by striking its neck. Roy's day was filled with unexpected adventures, from hunting deer and rabbits to facing a bear in the woods.|"['1.

Roy and Nelly had a successful hunt, but dragging the deer home was tough. They decided to leave the bear carcass outside overnight to avoid attracting wolves. With a huge fire burning, they camped beside the bear. The next day, they skinned the bear and dried the meat. In the evening, they went shoosking. Shoosking is a thrilling game where you slide down a snowy slope on a sledge. Roy and Nelly had a wild ride down the hill, experiencing some bumps along the way. Despite the crashes, they had fun and became more skilled with each slide. Shoosking is a popular game played by people of all ages in different parts of the world like Canada and Russia.|['1.

Their last journey that evening was just as the sun's final rays were shining between the hills on the opposite side of Silver Lake, casting a red glow on the hut and the scenery. Roy had fastened a snow-shoe on the outer edge of the snow-drift to mark the distance of their last leap, giving the sledge an extra push for more speed. This extra push made steering difficult, causing the sledge to turn over, throwing them into the snow in confusion. Luckily, they were unharmed. Roy, with a serious tone, discussed their journey ahead as they sat by the fire. Despite the enjoyable stay, they felt a sense of regret leaving. However, as they journeyed, their spirits lifted, and they looked forward to returning home. Challenges arose, like broken snow-shoes and a snowstorm, but they persevered, finding shelter in the woods. The hurricane raged outside, but they stayed safe in their sheltered spot. Roy led the way with the sledge, and Nell followed with her belongings. The landscape was barren, with plains and scattered trees.

Roy and Nelly were out in the snow, having a great time until evening came. As it got darker, they couldn't see well and accidentally got close to a dangerous cliff. The snow on the edge looked just like the rest of the snow around, so they didn't notice the drop. Suddenly, the snow gave way, and Roy fell over the edge with their sled. Nelly, standing at the edge, was frozen in fear. Roy managed to grab onto a bush growing on the cliff, saving himself. Nelly tied their belts together to help Roy climb back up. After a scary night, they found some forgotten food and felt hopeful again. They sadly made their way back, missing home more with each step.|['1.

That evening they had a more cheerful dinner. The next morning, they breakfasted heartily before heading out to fish, set snares, and make traps, feeling hopeful once more. As their young hearts filled with hope, they laughed and played like they did when they first arrived. Initially focused on replenishing their food, they fished, hunted, and dried provisions. However, a sudden thaw ruined their fish, and a wolf stole most of their dried meat. The harsh frost made game scarce, and fish harder to catch. By November, Roy and Nelly were still working hard but remained hopeful on the shores of Silver Lake. Meanwhile, Robin Gore and his wife were at Fort Enterprise, discussing plans with Black the Indian to search for their children, who were last seen with Hawk's party in the Black Hills. Robin's brother Jefferson and three others arrived at the fort, and Robin planned to leave them in charge while he embarked on the search with Walter and Larry.|"['1.

Robin Gore, upon hearing Slugs' harrowing account, altered his plans. Determined to seek retribution on the murderers before embarking on the quest for his missing children, he gathered a small but resolute group. Despite the odds, Robin believed his six-man party could confront the band of fifty savages. Leaving some men to guard Fort Enterprise, Robin set out with his chosen companions, including his nephew Walter and the hunter Slugs. As they silently traversed the snow-covered terrain, they spotted smoke in the distance. Waiting for nightfall, they devised a strategic attack plan. When the moment came, they ambushed the unsuspecting savages, swiftly taking down several foes. In the chaos, they managed to eliminate their targets, including Hawk, one of the key adversaries. Unbeknownst to Robin, this shift in plans unknowingly brought him closer to reuniting with his lost children.|"[""1.

Slugs and his companions found Macdonell fatally wounded in the camp. Before dying, Macdonell managed to convey that Wapaw was wounded but had escaped. The group set off to follow Wapaw's trail up into the hills. Slugs noticed Wapaw's pace slowing, indicating his weakening state. Despite concerns, Larry O'Dowd reassured the group that Wapaw's resilience would see him through. The party camped on a mound, creating a large fire to deter potential attackers. They kept watch through the night, with Slugs remaining cautious of any approaching danger. As dawn broke, the group silently prepared to resume their pursuit, venturing back into the woods.|"['1.

Larry disagreed, sharing his experience of how he used to think drinking was essential back in the old country. However, upon moving to the woods where he couldn't access alcohol, he realized he didn't need it to enjoy life. The group then ventured out of the woods into a beautiful, undulating landscape with snow-covered ponds and hills. While trying to locate Wapaw, who might have fallen over a precipice, they found tracks leading to a campsite. Despite their efforts to reach the sledge that fell over, they were unsuccessful, but they discovered clues that Wapaw was not far ahead.

The evening meal from the night before was repeated, with each member of the group taking turns to keep watch in case the Indians were tracking them. While enjoying their pipes after dinner, the Black Swan suddenly exclaimed and pointed to something in the snow beside Larry. It was a moccasin that Larry had unknowingly uncovered. The leader examined it closely, then smiled and dropped it. He mentioned that it reminded him of his daughter but quickly dismissed the thought. The group bantered about tea and their plans for the following day to continue their journey. As night fell, they settled down to sleep, except for Robin Gore, who stayed awake contemplating the worn-out moccasin. The scene then shifts to Silver Lake, where Roy and Nelly are facing dwindling provisions and a challenging winter ahead.

Roy displayed rebellion when Nelly suggested united prayer for the first time. Despite his rebuff, Nelly prepared for the promise of a deer. She expertly cut firewood, displaying skill and determination. As she rested, a large bird startled her. Nelly, undaunted, took her bow and arrows. The first arrow missed, but the second hit the bird, bringing her joy. She cleaned and prepared the bird for roasting. Suddenly, an unexpected visitor, a gaunt and half-naked savage, appeared.

"As the young girl stared in fear at the Indian approaching her, he greeted her with a simple ""Ho!"" and gently shook her hand like a white man. Nelly's look of terror turned to surprise as she noticed the Indian was tired and wounded, maybe even hungry. She quickly fetched water to clean his wounds, but he drank it all, so she went for more. Nelly, who had learned some Indian language, spoke with him, discovering that he was fleeing from a group that had killed white men. Suddenly, they heard a cry in the forest. The Indian, Wapaw, listened intently, and Nelly hurried towards the sound. There, she found Roy, startled by strange tracks.

Wapaw agreed to the plan and suggested they rest immediately. Roy, exhausted from the day, agreed. In less than half an hour, all three were fast asleep. The next morning, they woke up refreshed. While Wapaw and Nelly packed their belongings onto the sledge, Roy went fishing at Silver Lake. He caught four good-sized fish. With this added to their provisions, they set out around noon, taking a detour to avoid any pursuing Indians. That evening, a group of hunters, led by Robin, arrived at Silver Lake. They found the hut, saw signs of the missing trio, and decided to follow their trail. After a night and day of tracking, they reached a point where they saw a faint light on a mound. Wapaw, Roy, and Nelly, alerted by a noise, watched the hunters from a safe vantage point. Robin sent Black Swan to scout ahead. Black Swan approached the camp cautiously, ready for any threat. He signaled the others to join him, and they moved closer, with Robin filled with anticipation.|"['1.

Roy hesitated, his hand trembling as he raised it. Despite his tough life in the wild West, he had never faced the prospect of harming another person. The thought of taking a life in such a deliberate manner made him shudder. However, he knew their situation was dire, so he steeled himself for the task. Just then, Obadiah Stiff entered the camp and stirred the fire, revealing some white men among them. Wapaw, recognizing them, lowered his rifle. He then led Roy and the others to a hidden spot, cautioning them not to move until he returned. After a brief moment, Wapaw joined the group and swiftly integrated himself into their midst. The hunter's words carried a hint of doubt, prompting Wapaw to go fetch the children.

In the midst of their busy preparations, Robin suggested to his daughter, Nell, that they take a break and go shoosking. Excited, the group grabbed their sledges and spent the morning sliding down hills. Once ready to depart for Fort Enterprise, the hunters strapped provisions on the sledges, put on snow-shoes, checked their weapons, and set out on a frosty December morning. As they journeyed through the North American wilderness, the snow whirled around them, the wind howled, and the sun set in a fiery red sky. On New Year's Day, they halted, realizing their goal was unattainable. Despite the setback, they celebrated the day with a hearty breakfast. Mrs. Gore, initially melancholy, found solace in reading the Bible. Jeff, always in good spirits, emphasized the importance of a full stomach for any undertaking. Suddenly, the dogs' barking signaled a visitor, and a familiar figure approached, bringing cheer to the group.|"['1.
