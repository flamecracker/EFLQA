"Miss Stevens came to Roselands with a plan to win Mr. Horace Dinsmore's heart by being kind to his daughter, Elsie. However, Mr. Dinsmore's disapproval hinted at trouble for her scheme. Miss Stevens, confident in her looks and talents, was not discouraged. During a dinner party, she tried to sit next to Elsie, but Mr. Travilla beat her to it, making Elsie sit on his lap.
