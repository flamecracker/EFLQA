"Marjorie managed to get two plates of ice cream and some cakes, holding them above the crowd as she made her way to the far corner where Ruth had pointed. She found Alice, a lonely freshman, sitting by herself, looking sad and homesick. Marjorie felt sorry for her and chatted with her during the break. She even arranged for Alice to have a dance partner for the next dance before promising to check on her again later.

Marjorie was puzzled by Ruth's sudden decision to host a tea party. She suspected Ruth might be trying to gain popularity to secure a leadership position.

Ruth shivered as she faced her old rival, Marjorie, at the tea she had planned to avoid her. Feeling fate or her conscience haunting her, Ruth subtly criticized Marjorie's focus on sports over class duties to sway classmates against her. Ruth's scheme worked as classmates echoed her sentiments. In an English class meeting, Marjorie's idea to help homesick freshmen was met with Ruth's suggestion of fostering competition instead of pity. Ruth's plan gained support as Evelyn backed her stance. Ruth's strategic moves aimed to diminish Marjorie's popularity, showing her determination to secure her own success.

"""Let's start with our class elections,"" suggested Doris, checking the time. ""We can continue our discussion afterward until nine o'clock. Nominations are open!"" The speed of the process left Marjorie's friends surprised by her sudden loss of the class presidency opportunity. Marjorie, engrossed in hockey and Scout activities, wasn't bothered. Lily, shocked by her own nomination, didn't realize Marjorie's absence. Ruth, thrilled by the chance, felt certain of her victory against Lily and Evelyn. However, the election results surprised Ruth as Evelyn won with seven votes, including Ruth's support. Ruth learned that some girls were envious of Scouts and voted for Evelyn. Ruth remained confident but was defeated, realizing Lily's genuine nature and hard work earned her the presidency. Marjorie was delighted with Lily's win, despite her own missed opportunity to help freshmen. Lily's victory showed that authenticity and loyalty triumph over past perceptions."|"['1.

Marjorie enjoyed the situation because Ruth, who had been over-confident and scornful the previous year, had a big disappointment for not being elected. Marjorie advised making Ruth a friend before she turned into an enemy due to spite. The next day was warm and beautiful, making the girls think of summer. Lily Andrews decided to consult with Doris Sands while Marjorie planned to spend the afternoon paddling her canoe and reading poetry. Marjorie usually enjoyed others' company but today felt dreamy and wanted solitude. She received a letter from John Hadley, a Boy Scout she admired, which made her heart flutter.

Every Scout proudly wore her uniform as they gathered in the room set aside for their troop meeting. The Captain, seated at her desk, received each Scout with a salute. It felt nostalgic, reminiscent of old times, except for the absence of the two seniors who had graduated. The current members couldn't help but think of them. Marjorie, pondering the relentless passage of time, realized that she too would graduate one day, leaving the school and Scout troop to younger girls. As they began the meeting with the customary ceremony, Marjorie, a newer member, found the Scout laws and pledge particularly meaningful. She shared the troop's plan for a Good Turn, supporting a girl named Frieda Hammer to attend public school in town.

The freshmen were eager to come up with a plan for action, but lacked direction without appointed leaders. Ethel Todd, the junior president, known for her resourcefulness, took charge. She suspected Ruth Henry's schemes and decided to outsmart her. Observing Ruth's movements, Ethel noticed a pattern with other girls tailing specific freshmen. Ethel devised a clever plan to ensure the freshmen's success. She secretly instructed forty freshmen to meet at the shower-bath compartment early the next day in bathrobes. Ruth, oversleeping, rushed to the shower only to find a group of freshmen already there, celebrating Florence Evans' election as freshman president.

Marjorie felt regret for losing her temper and hoped her outburst had gone unnoticed. Lily found Marjorie despondent, distracted from her geometry book. Lily tried to cheer her up with news, but Marjorie's disappointment was evident. Miss Phillips, the teacher, announced the team lineup for the upcoming game, including Marjorie and her friends. Marjorie's attention wavered, and she seemed distant. Miss Phillips noticed but said nothing, understanding everyone has off days. Marjorie inquired about Helen's ankle injury, showing concern for her friend's recovery. Miss Phillips praised Mae's improvement, noting her dedication to studies after missing out on the Scout troop. Marjorie realized she had neglected a homesick freshman, Alice, in favor of another friend, Frieda. Marjorie learned that education can profoundly impact a person's life.|"[""1.

Marjorie expressed her gratitude with a quick look before leaving. While she momentarily felt uplifted and relieved, she knew this feeling wouldn't last. Deep down, she sensed upcoming challenges and dangers that Frieda, Lily, and their friends would have to navigate before achieving true moral safety. In October, the hockey team roster was revealed, sparking intense interest among the students. Disappointment spread as many girls who had hoped to become Girl Scouts fell short. However, those who made the team, like Mae, Barbara, and the freshmen Florence, Alice, and Daisy, cherished the honor. Marjorie, now the team captain, enjoyed her newfound popularity and the joy of her friend Alice. Despite some tensions with Frieda, the girls were excited to explore the colorful woods and a distant stream, eager for adventure.|['1.

As dessert was served, Miss Allen's gaze met hers, and she sadly shook her head in response. The Principal then stood and shared Marjorie's story, inquiring about the missing canoe. No one spoke up. Miss Allen decided to convene a meeting at eight that evening to question each girl about their whereabouts that afternoon. The girls, though nervous, complied, and all alibis were verified. Marjorie felt disheartened, fearing the girls might suspect her. The meeting, initiated formally, turned chaotic upon learning of Frieda's disappearance. The Scouts knew Frieda's situation, and Marjorie's idea to trust her with funds. Despite the loss of her canoe and trust, Marjorie was reluctant to accept defeat. Miss Phillips suggested using funds for a new canoe and aiding a needy family for Christmas. Marjorie appreciated the gesture but questioned accepting defeat.|"[""1.

The mood at the meeting shifted from discussing a theft to planning a carefree Halloween party. Marjorie, despite her worries, joined in the fun. The Scout troop prepared for their last event before new members joined. The girls of Pansy troop were close-knit, except for two. They eagerly anticipated the party but Marjorie's hopes dimmed with a telegram. The party had a costume theme with homemade outfits. The gym was decorated with autumn leaves and paper witches. Guests arrived in historical costumes, and Lily tried to count them. When more guests arrived, suspicions arose that outsiders were invited. The guessing game and costume contest added to the excitement. Marjorie felt homesick without John, but found solace in the festivities and a dance with David Conner.|"['1.

Miss Phillips explained that they would reach the basement through an underground connection from the gym to the main building. They walked single file through a dark passage with their hands on the shoulders of the person in front. As they advanced, the passage became lower and pitch-black, making them bend down and feel their way. Doris, leading the group, got scared when a ghost-like figure with skeletal hands and a skull for a head approached her. However, it turned out to be a cleverly decorated basement for a picnic supper celebration. Marjorie, reflecting on her past mistakes, felt remorse for not helping Alice with her studies. Despite this, Alice successfully joined the Girl Scouts, along with other new members, leading to a joyous and congratulatory atmosphere among the girls.|"['1.

The house looked like any other, just larger and once grand. It's said to be haunted, but Miss Phillips doubts it due to its disrepair. The girls, led by the Scout Captain, approached the eerie house. Doris, timid yet intrigued by ghost stories, asked for the haunted house tale. They strolled through the woods, spotting winter birds. Ruth won a nut-gathering game. As they climbed a hill, they saw the village below and the old stone wall alongside the road. The iron gates, now rusted, marked the entrance to the haunted house. As they admired the gate's design, an old woman approached, sending chills down their spines.|['1.

As the car drove down the main street, Marjorie noticed a large building on the corner with a crowd of girls streaming out. Approaching closer, she recognized some in Girl Scout attire. Marjorie glimpsed Frieda and noticed a remarkable change in her appearance. Frieda looked neat, her hair styled nicely, and most importantly, she appeared happy and transformed. Frieda shared her journey with Marjorie, including starting a Girl Scout troop, saving money for Marjorie's canoe, and attending night school. Marjorie's radiant joy was evident to all, and even John realized the depth of her happiness, though he felt a pang of jealousy. This newfound happiness stemmed from Marjorie's involvement with the Girl Scouts and a factory visit. The girls attended a college function, feeling youthful and shy. The day ended with Marjorie falling asleep on the ride home, exhausted from the day's events. On Saturday, the Scouts participated in an operetta set in a beautiful outdoor amphitheater, adding a touch of magic to the spring festival.|"['1.
