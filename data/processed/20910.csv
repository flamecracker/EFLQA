The first part of this new volume of the _American Fights and Fighters Series_ needs no special introduction. Partly to make this the same size as the other books, but more particularly because I especially desired to give a permanent place to some of the most dramatic and interesting episodes in our history--especially as most of them related to the Pacific and the Far West--the series of papers in part second was included.

""The Yarn of the _Essex_, Whaler"" is abridged from a quaint account written by the Mate and published in an old volume which is long since out of print and very scarce. The papers on the _Tonquin_, John Paul Jones, and ""The Great American Duellists"" speak for themselves. The account of the battle of the Pitt River has never been published in book form heretofore. The last paper ""On Being a Boy Out West"" I inserted because I enjoy it myself, and because I have found that others young and old who have read it generally like it also.

One of the first significant expeditions along the northern coast of South America took place in 1499-1500 led by Ojeda, a remarkable explorer accompanied by Juan de la Cosa and Vespucci. They were involved in various explorations along the Gulf coast and its surroundings, including voyages by Pizons, Lepe, Cabral, Bastidas, and La Cosa. Columbus, on his fourth voyage, reached Honduras and unknowingly sailed along the Gulf of Darien, mistaking it for Veragua. Subsequent voyages by La Cosa, Vespucci, and Ojeda aimed at establishing colonies, trading, or searching for gold and pearls. Ferdinand, the Crafty, was alerted about potential English presence on the coast, prompting him to thwart any English colonization efforts by establishing Spanish colonies. Two contenders, Alonzo de Ojeda and Diego de Nicuesa, vied for the opportunity to lead these expeditions, each possessing extraordinary qualities but facing challenges in their endeavors.|['1.

Ferdinand could not choose between the rival claimants. He decided to send out two expeditions. The Gulf of Uraba, now called the Gulf of Darien, was to divide the territory. Ojeda would have the land from the Gulf to Cape de la Vela, named new Andalusia. Nicuesa would get the area between the Gulf and Cape Gracias รก Dios, called Golden Castile. Each governor had to fund their expedition. They both used Jamaica as a base. Ojeda had fewer resources than Nicuesa, who arrived with a larger fleet. The governors quarreled, and Ojeda challenged Nicuesa to a duel, but it never happened. Ojeda sailed first, followed by Nicuesa, who faced delays. Ojeda landed at Cartagena, despite warnings of danger from La Cosa.|"['1.

After landing without trouble, Ojeda gathered the locals and read them a nonsensical message from Spain, demanding they convert to Christianity and submit to Spanish rule. The natives, not understanding, responded with poisoned arrows. Ojeda captured seventy-five men and women as slaves. When the enraged natives attacked, Ojeda and his men fought fiercely. Eventually, only Ojeda remained unharmed, using a shield to fend off poison arrows. La Cosa saved Ojeda from the attacking natives. Ojeda, in a fit of rage, fought the natives alone. La Cosa and his men, surrounded, fought desperately. La Cosa was mortally wounded, leaving one man standing. The surviving Spaniards were left alone by the Indians, and La Cosa instructed his comrade to inform Ojeda of their fate. Ojeda was found near death but was rescued and brought back to the ship. Nicuesa's ships arrived, and Ojeda and Nicuesa reconciled their differences.|"[""1.

The following night, a group of four hundred men gathered secretly. They landed near an Indian town, encircled it, and set it ablaze. Despite fierce resistance from the defenders, many Spaniards fell to poisonous arrows. The village was destroyed, and the inhabitants perished. Nicuesa's horses terrified the survivors, causing some to flee back into the flames rather than face the unfamiliar beasts. Nicuesa and Ojeda parted ways, with Nicuesa heading to Veragua and Ojeda establishing San Sebastian. Facing conflicts with the native people and suffering losses, Ojeda led his men in search of gold and slaves. In a brave act, Ojeda endured excruciating pain to remove a poisoned arrow from his thigh, showing remarkable endurance and determination.

Talavera and his group had no other place to go, so they remained at San Sebastian. Soon, their provisions ran out, and with no sign of Encisco bringing help, someone had to go back to Hispaniola for rescue. Ojeda volunteered. He left Francisco Pizarro in charge at San Sebastian and set sail with Talavera. Ojeda believed he was in control of the ship, but the crew disagreed. They put Ojeda in chains, but he challenged them to a duel. As a storm hit, they had to release him. Ojeda took command and managed the ship until it wrecked in Cuba. They trekked eastward under Ojeda's leadership. They reached Cueyabos, where they were welcomed. Ojeda fulfilled his vow by leaving a picture of the Virgin Mary in a shrine. Eventually, they were rescued, and Ojeda returned to Santo Domingo. Talavera and his crew were tried and executed for piracy. Ojeda, facing misfortune, died in a monastery.

Pizarro had faithfully kept his promise to Ojeda, waiting fifty days for more of his men to perish so they could all escape on the two remaining ships. Despite the loss of one ship due to a fish incident, only Pizarro and about thirty men survived from the original three hundred. Encisco, doubtful of their actions, eventually led the survivors back to San Sebastian. Balboa, a valuable addition, suggested a new opportunity in the Gulf of Darien, where a tribe with gold awaited, unaware of poisoned arrows. The colonists eagerly prepared vessels to journey across the gulf to Panama, once Nicuesa's territory. Balboa's proposal was met with enthusiasm, marking a turning point for the desperate group.|"['1.

The Spanish explorers, led by Balboa, discovered Indian villages and engaged in a fierce battle with Cacique Cemaco. They captured the village, found gold, and established a fort named Maria de la Antigua del Darien. Balboa gained favor and replaced Encisco, who had imposed harsh rules. Meanwhile, Nicuesa's ship wrecked, and his crew was stranded on a desert island. Diego de Ribero and three sailors went in search of help. Nicuesa and the others, struggling through forests and swamps, reached an almost deserted island. The sailors believed to have abandoned them, but Ribero returned with help just in time. Nicuesa, after a series of misfortunes, sentenced Olano to death but later commuted the punishment.|"[""1.

Nicuesa faced a series of disasters, losing ships and men. Reduced to a mere hundred, they found refuge in Porto Rico. Attacked by Indians, they built ships from wrecks. When reinforcements arrived under Colmenares, factions formed. Nicuesa, arrogant, claimed their gold. The colony, fearing his rule, plotted against him. Balboa advised preventing Nicuesa from landing. Despite attempts to modify his approach, Nicuesa was confronted by soldiers upon landing. He was powerless against the angry crowd.

He ran away. Balboa, a nobleman, tried to help the fleeing governor Nicuesa but failed. Nicuesa, rejected by his people, was forced onto a poorly made ship with little food. He and his loyal followers set sail, never to return. Did they perish from hunger, storms, or attacks by angered natives? No one knows. A legend on a tree in Veragua hinted at Nicuesa's tragic end. Only a few men from the original group of eleven hundred remained in Antigua. Balboa's rise to fame and his eventual downfall will be discussed in the following text.|"['1.

This is the adventurous tale of Vasco Nuรฑez de Balboa, a Spanish explorer who sailed on small caravels and brigantines in search of new lands. Balboa, a noble and kind-hearted man, found love with an Indian girl amidst his daring expeditions. Despite facing challenges from rivals like Encisco, Balboa remained determined to explore and establish peace on the Isthmus. His actions, including sending messengers to Spain, led to misunderstandings with the King of Spain, who accused him of various crimes, even the death of Diego de Nicuesa. As tensions rose, a new governor, Pedrarias, was appointed to lead a grand expedition to Darien.

The first fleet departed on April 11, 1514, and safely reached Antigua on June 29 of the same year. The settlement was well-established with about 300 soldiers carefully selected for their skills and strength. Balboa, the leader, remained calm and welcoming despite the arrival of Pedrarias, the new Governor. Balboa's character had transformed from a reckless adventurer to a responsible and successful captain. He led expeditions with wisdom, treating the natives respectfully and maintaining peace. Despite facing threats from Pedrarias, Balboa aimed to impress the King with his achievements to gain favor and protection. Balboa's soldiers admired him, although a few rebelled against his strict discipline.

Balboa, a Spanish explorer, had a daring plan to discover the ocean on the other side of the Isthmus. Nicuesa left some men at Nombre de Dios when he came down. Balboa rescued them and brought them to Antigua. During an expedition, two white men disguised as Indians revealed themselves to Balboa. They had escaped from Nicuesa and sought refuge with an Indian chief named Careta. They offered to betray the Indians in exchange for forgiveness. Balboa agreed and captured the chief, but instead of harming him, he released him. Balboa's kindness was due to a woman, Careta's daughter, whom he fell in love with and married. Balboa met Chief Comagre, who told them about a land with abundant gold across the Isthmus. This news excited Balboa and his men, sparking their desire to explore the new lands and seas beyond.|"['1.

Balboa sent a report to Spain requesting one thousand men, but the message arrived before Pedrarias set sail. Balboa decided to lead the expedition himself after learning of Spain's plans against him. With a group of 190 men, bloodhounds, and Indian slaves, he departed from Antigua in 1513. The journey was tough, through hostile tribes and challenging terrain. Despite the obstacles, Balboa's determination led them to the foot of a mountain where they could see the South Sea. Only 67 men, including Francisco Pizarro, could climb the mountain. Balboa, with his mix of courage and diplomacy, reached the summit alone and saw the vast ocean, which he named the South Sea.|"['1.

"In the name of Castile and Leon, Balboa drew his sword and claimed the land. His soldiers, led by Pizarro, gathered beside him in silent wonder. A chant broke the stillness as they sang the ""Te Deum Laudamus"" atop the peak in Darien. Balboa's vision and imagination soared, seeing lands rich with treasures and distant isles. They built a cross on the mountain peak, then journeyed to the beach. After days of searching, they reached the shore at low tide. Balboa, with a banner of Spain and drawn sword, waded into the ocean, claiming its waters for the King. They named an island San Miguel, ventured back to Antigua, and shared their treasures with the colonists. Balboa dispatched a ship to inform the King of their discovery and seek permission to explore further.

"Balboa faced challenges with Pedrarias, enduring trials and accusations. Despite being acquitted of wrongdoing, Pedrarias harassed him, leading to financial ruin. The expedition under Pedrarias suffered greatly, losing many men to disease. Pedrarias, seeking riches, sent survivors to gather treasures, resulting in violence and chaos. Balboa's efforts to establish peace were undone by the cruelty of Pedrarias. Known as ""The Scourge of God,"" Pedrarias ruled with ruthless ferocity.

Balboa suggested to Pedrarias that they embark on a voyage to the South Sea. Despite Balboa being a mere provincial governor under Pedrarias, the latter eventually agreed. Balboa planned to construct four ships for the expedition, requiring timber from the eastern side of the Isthmus. The ship-building process began at a settlement named Ada, with the timber transported across the mountain to the river Valsa for completion. Although faced with setbacks, Balboa persevered. Eventually, two brigantines were launched, and he set sail to the Pacific. However, news of Pedrarias' potential replacement led Balboa to send messengers to Ada for confirmation. Unfortunately, a soldier overheard a conversation, misinterpreted it as treachery, and reported it to the governor, jeopardizing Balboa's plans.|"['1.

At Ada, Andres Garavito, an enemy of Balboa, made advances towards Balboa's wife, leading to a confrontation. Garavito, seeking revenge, falsely convinced Pedrarias that Balboa planned treachery. Consequently, Balboa and his allies were imprisoned. Despite a loyal defense, Balboa was unjustly found guilty of treason. Facing death, Balboa remained resolute, denying the accusations until his execution. Even with pleas for mercy, Pedrarias remained adamant. Balboa's companions met the same fate, with the last, Arguello, appealing for clemency but to no avail.

To the future sorrow of America and the great diminution of Spain's glory and peace, Balboa, the gallant and noble-hearted explorer, passed away. Pedrarias, a less honorable figure, lived until his eighty-ninth year. Balboa's birthplace, Estremadura, was vital in the conquests of Peru and Mexico. In this region, an obscure man named Gonzalo Pizarro lived, fathering several sons, including Francisco and Hernando. Francisco, born around 1471, was of humble origins and lacked education, yet he made a significant impact in history. Legends suggest Francisco was a swineherd, unable to read or write. Despite his humble beginnings, he went on to achieve great things, leaving behind a lasting legacy. His life was initially obscure, with little information available about his early years.|"['1.

"In 1510, Pizarro, an officer under Alonzo de Ojeda in America, showed his leadership by taking charge of a colony in San Sebastian, Darien. When help didn't arrive, he made a tough decision to leave after many died. Pizarro joined Encisco's expedition to Darien and crossed the Isthmus with Vasco Nuรฑez de Balboa, becoming the second to see the Great South Sea in 1513. Later, he served under Pedro Arias de Avila, known for his cruelty. In 1515, Pizarro and Morales explored the territory of a chief named Biru, inspiring the name ""Land of Biru"" or Peru.

In their quest, Pizarro and his crew faced immense challenges. With little knowledge of sailing, they ventured along the unknown shore in a small ship. Despite landing occasionally, they found no trace of the empire they sought. Faced with starvation and dwindling hope, the crew demanded to go back. Pizarro, persistent and unwavering, refused and continued southward after replenishing supplies. They encountered battles with natives, losing men and facing peril. Despite setbacks, they pressed on, gathering rumors of El Dorado. Almagro, another explorer, joined the quest, facing his own battles and setbacks.

Pizarro embarked on a daring expedition, bringing back gold and silver ornaments, woven garments, and more from a craft near the shore, proving the existence of a sought-after land. With Almagro's reinforcements, they sailed south, discovering evidence of cultivation and large villages along the Andes. Anchoring near a town with gold-adorned inhabitants, a skirmish broke out. Startled by a fallen horse splitting into two, the Indians retreated. Facing a shortage of supplies and a fierce quarrel, Pizarro decided to stay on Gallo Island while Almagro sought reinforcements. Despite objections, Pizarro remained steadfast. Eventually, a new governor sent ships to rescue them.

Pizarro's powerful speech inspired a small group of his comrades, led by Ruiz and Pedro de Candia, to follow him across a line drawn in the sand. Around thirteen to sixteen men joined him on this daring journey. Despite opposition from Tafur, Pizarro and his men persisted and found themselves stranded on the Island of Gorgona. With no means of escape, their situation seemed dire. Yet, their resolve was unwavering. This pivotal moment marked the turning point in the conquest of Peru. The treasures of Peru held immense significance, shaping the course of history. The Spanish conquests funded wars, influenced religious zeal, and ignited the flames of the Inquisition. Pizarro's actions had far-reaching consequences, impacting empires and altering the world's trajectory.

Too few a force to seize the chance, they had no choice but to return to Panama. Pizarro and De Candia were to sail to Spain to seek royal approval and support while Almagro and Luque readied for the final mission. Pizarro faced an arrest in Spain but was swiftly released and granted an audience with the king. He secured a royal mandate to conquer Peru, becoming Governor and Captain-General. His companions were also honored, with Almagro and Luque receiving titles. Pizarro returned to Trujillo and departed for Peru in 1530.

"The Inca tribe ruled with the Emperor as the supreme leader. Their empire was highly organized, with the Inca embodying the empire itself. Unfortunately, this extreme organization led to the downfall of the empire as the people lacked a sense of national spirit due to the oppressive rule. The Incas integrated conquered territories into their empire, referring to them as ""the four quarters of the earth."" Unlike the Aztecs, the Incas governed through strategic policies rather than brute force. Their government was patriarchal, theocratic, and despotic.

The spiritual growth of the Peruvian people was remarkable. They revered a mysterious Supreme Being and worshipped without resorting to human sacrifice. Primarily, they honored the sun, moon, and stars, with the Inca symbolizing the sun's earthly form. Sun-worship, a natural religion, was esteemed the highest. Their history was veiled in antiquity. At the time of Pizarro's arrival, a unique situation unfolded due to Huayna Capac dividing his realm between his sons, Huascar and Atahualpa, leading to civil strife. Pizarro, with a small but valiant army, embarked on the conquest of the vast Inca empire. Establishing the city of San Miguel, they prepared for the daunting task ahead.

Pizarro, a skilled leader, faced a critical decision as his army approached the city of Caxamarca. Despite the easier path to the imperial capital of Cuzco, Pizarro chose the challenging mountain route to confront Atahualpa, the Inca ruler. With determination, Pizarro and his soldiers overcame the treacherous terrain. Eventually, they beheld the lush plains before them, with the fortified city of Caxamarca nestled in a valley. The city, usually bustling with a population of ten thousand, now lay deserted. As the Spaniards ventured into the city under a stormy sky, they were met with an eerie quietness. Pizarro strategically positioned his troops in the triangular Plaza, surrounded by stone houses and a towering fortress. Facing an army of fifty thousand Incan soldiers across the river, Pizarro knew there was no turning back. The stage was set for a historic encounter that would shape the course of history.|['1.

The tired Spaniards quickly settled in the empty buildings near the square, posting guards for safety and preparing for defense. While they readied for the night, Hernando de Soto was sent as an envoy to Atahualpa's camp with twenty horsemen. Concerned about the small number for defense, Pizarro then sent Hernando with twenty more cavalrymen. The Inca sat surrounded by nobles and soldiers when the envoys arrived, showing no emotion until he finally agreed to visit the Spaniards the next day. De Soto, a skilled horseman, impressed the Inca with his horse's agility. However, some of the Inca's men showed fear, resulting in their execution by Atahualpa's command. The Inca's response to the Spanish presence was cold, and his decisions led to tragic consequences.|"[""1.

De Soto and Hernando Pizarro, unsatisfied and troubled, returned to the city. After a long discussion that night, they made a critical decision. They faced criticism for their actions but believed seizing the Inca was necessary for their safety. Their initial intention was to plunder the land without regard for its people, leading to subsequent crimes. The leaders were inspired by Cortes' actions in Mexico and saw capturing the Inca as a way to control the region. Despite the treachery involved, they felt it was the only option. The Spaniards prepared for the Inca's arrival, positioning troops strategically and ensuring their arms were ready. The priest Fra Vincente de Valverde conducted a solemn mass before the soldiers awaited the Inca's visit. Atahualpa arrived in grandeur, carried on a throne of gold with a retinue of attendants. His attire reflected his imperial status, adorned with precious jewels and vibrant colors. The scene was a mix of splendor and tension as the Inca approached the city square.|"['1.

At that time, as requested by Pizarro, Father Valverde stepped forward in his religious attire, holding a crucifix in one hand and a holy book in the other. He was accompanied by a Peruvian named Felippo, who acted as an interpreter. Despite Felippo's limited language skills, he was the best available. Father Valverde then spoke to the Inca, explaining Christian beliefs and demanding his allegiance to the Pope and King Charles V. However, the Inca, Atahualpa, rejected these demands, stating his own beliefs and refusing to bow to any earthly ruler. When Valverde showed him the book, the Inca threw it to the ground in anger. Subsequently, chaos erupted as Pizarro's men attacked the unarmed Peruvians, leading to a violent confrontation where the Inca was overthrown.|"['1.

Upon capturing the Inca, the Spaniards swiftly subdued any resistance from the unarmed Inca's followers. The Indians scattered in fear, leaving the army leaderless and disorganized. The Spaniards held the Inca captive, rendering the army powerless. Estimates suggest that thousands perished in a brief battle at Caxamarca. Pizarro, the Spanish leader, kept the Inca captive but treated him decently. The Inca's generals, Quiz-Quiz and Chalcuchima, executed Huascar, another Inca captive, under Atahualpa's orders. Atahualpa, seeking freedom, offered to fill a room with gold in exchange for his release. He ordered his people to gather treasures from all corners of the empire, including gold and silver, to meet the ransom. The room was filled with treasures of exquisite craftsmanship, including gold plants and animals. Pizarro preserved some of these artifacts, but most of the gold was melted down to satisfy the Spanish greed.|"[""1.

Atahualpa nearly filled his ransom space, but Pizarro declared the Inca had paid it in a notarized agreement. Despite this, Atahualpa remained captive as releasing him was deemed risky. The Spaniards decided to eliminate him. The ransom was worth over seventeen million dollars, with Pizarro receiving seven hundred thousand dollars. Almagro's men demanded a share but were given smaller amounts. Hernando Pizarro was sent to Spain with the royal fifth and to secure rewards.

Felippo, the infamous interpreter, caused a rift between Atahualpa and the Spaniards. Despite Atahualpa's pleas, he was sentenced to death on August 29, 1533. The Spanish soldiers surrounded him as he was chained to a stake in the square of Caxamarca. The Peruvians, unable to intervene, wept helplessly. Atahualpa, once a proud monarch, showed little bravery. Valverde, the friar, offered him baptism to spare him from burning. Atahualpa accepted, becoming Juan de Atahualpa. Before his death, he asked Pizarro to care for his children. The soldiers recited the Apostolic Creed during his execution.

The story of Atahualpa reveals a ruthless and cruel leader, lacking in both magnanimity and resolution. Despite his flaws, his tragic fate and the betrayals he faced evoke sympathy. After his demise, the diadem was passed to Toparca, Huascar's youthful brother, who rejected the symbol of shame and died in despair. Manco Capac, the rightful heir, then claimed the Inca title but soon realized his puppet status under Pizarro's rule. As the Spanish colonization unfolded, Cuzco was transformed into a grand city with impressive architecture and infrastructure. The Spanish influx led to the enslavement of the natives and the division of land. Tensions brewed as Almagro sought his own fortune, setting the stage for a looming conflict that would engulf all involved in the conquest of Peru.|"['1.

During the founding of Lima by Francisco Pizarro, his brother Hernando became the governor of Cuzco. Hernando, the most able and admirable of the Pizarros, was tasked with treating the Inca and his people kindly by Charles V. However, he did not keep a close watch on young Manco, the Inca, who managed to escape to the Valley of Yucay to gather forces against the Spaniards. In 1536, a large Peruvian army led by Manco descended upon Cuzco. The Pizarro brothers, Hernando, Juan, and Gonzalo, fought valiantly but were outnumbered. The Peruvians set fire to their own city to drive out the invaders. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Pizarros displayed great courage and military prowess during the siege. Hernando was known for his daring exploits, while Gonzalo was considered the best lancer in the New World.|['1.

The Peruvians fortified the streets with debris and sharpened stakes, ready for a final attack. Despite heavy losses among the Indians, the Spaniards faced overwhelming odds with over one hundred thousand warriors against them. The young Inca, adorned in gold and silver, fought bravely alongside the Spaniards. A discussion arose about seizing the fortress of Sacsahuaman, with Juan Pizarro advising against it. Hernando, determined to hold the town, rallied the soldiers to take the fortress. Juan led the assault but was fatally wounded.

Gonzalo took over as the leader after a fierce battle where his men showed great courage. They were pushed back from the fortress despite gaining the outer walls. The fighting moved from the city to the hills, a tactical mistake by the Peruvians. Hernando and his men were kept busy in the city, while Juan and Gonzalo faced the Peruvians at Sacsahuaman. As night fell, Hernando joined his men on the hill, and they prepared scaling-ladders for the next day's assault. The Spaniards attacked with fury, capturing wall after wall until the fighting reached the citadel. The Inca sent reinforcements, but the Spaniards managed to hold them off. The High Priest fled, leaving a few defenders, including a chief who fought heroically, refusing to surrender. The fortress was finally taken, and the Peruvians retreated temporarily. Hernando prepared for the next battle as the Peruvians laid siege to the city. Francisco Pizarro was besieged in Lima, while help arrived unexpectedly for the brothers in Cuzco from Almagro, who had faced challenges on his march to Chili. Almagro's army defeated the Peruvians, leading to the dissipation of their forces. The Inca maintained a hidden court, but the Peruvians no longer posed a threat to the Spaniards.|"['1.

Francisco, the Marquis, sent Captain Alvarado to aid Cuzco, but Almagro defeated Alvarado at Abancay in 1537. Despite advice to execute Hernando and Gonzalo, Almagro spared them. Gonzalo escaped and led forces against Francisco. A meeting between Francisco and Almagro turned hostile, leading to a battle at Salinas in 1538. Hernando Pizarro, dressed uniquely, led the fight and emerged victorious. Orgonez was killed, and Almagro, old and ill, was captured. A conspiracy to free Almagro failed, and he was sentenced to death, strangled, and his head displayed in Cuzco. Almagro, though flawed, faced a tragic end due to conflicts with Pizarro.|"['1.

The Pizarro brothers pretended to be deeply saddened by the necessity of executing Almagro. They mourned, acted as pallbearers, and showed outward signs of grief. Almagro had a son named Diego with an Indian woman, under Pizarro's care in Lima. Despite initial threats, Diego was spared. Peace seemed restored after quelling rebellions. Hernando went to Spain, while Gonzalo explored eastward. Gonzalo's expedition faced hardships, with Orellana deserting to sail the Amazon. Francisco Marquis was left in Peru, facing unrest from men of Chili. A conspiracy led by Juan de Rada aimed to kill Pizarro. On June 26, 1541, assassins attacked Pizarro in Lima.

Pizarro's remarkable defense in the face of the conspirators left them puzzled until De Rada, without mercy, sacrificed one of his comrades to save himself. Pizarro was then attacked by multiple blades, but he fought back, leaving a cross in his own blood. Despite the severe criticism he faced, some have defended his legacy. Hernando Pizarro's delay in Spain led to accusations of negligence and unlawful actions. His defense of Cusco went unheard, and he spent years in prison. His marriage to his niece Francisca continued the Pizarro family line in Spain. De Rada, after Francisco's death, rallied Almagro's supporters but faced defeat against Vaca de Castro's forces.

Gonzalo Pizarro became the ruler of Peru, controlling a vast territory along the South American coast. Despite being far from Spain, the Spanish monarch sent Gasca, a capable ecclesiastic, to address the situation. Gasca cleverly gained the support of Gonzalo's navy captains and mustered a force to challenge Gonzalo's rule. After a bloody battle at Huarina, Gasca managed to sway Gonzalo's men by promising to repeal harsh laws and highlighting their rebellion against the king. Deserted by his followers, Gonzalo faced defeat and was beheaded in Cuzco. His estates were confiscated, and he met his fate bravely, asking for prayers for his soul. The last Inca, Manco Capac, met a tragic end at the hands of a Spaniard named Perez during a game of bowls in the mountains.

When Malinal turned nineteen, a strange rumor spread along the Gulf of Mexico shores. Unseen beings arrived in extraordinary boats, never witnessed by the Aztecs. Reports of white demi-gods from the south reached the Aztec Empire, causing alarm. On Good Friday, March 23, 1519, the feared strangers landed in Vera Cruz. Led by Fernando Cortes, born in 1485, he defied expectations. Initially frail, Cortes studied law but yearned for adventure. Hindered by illness, he set sail for the New World in 1504.

Hernando Cortes, a renowned leader, was determined to achieve his goals at any cost, even if it meant being cruel in his actions. He valued his mission to conquer, civilize, and convert over the lives of those he deemed as barbarians. Cortes, unlike the people of the nineteenth century, did not place a high value on human life. He was a devout man, well-versed in prayers and psalms, but he was willing to sacrifice lives for his greater ambitions. Despite his cruel methods, his conquest of Mexico was a remarkable feat of genius and a stroke of good fortune. Cortes was chosen to lead an expedition to explore the wealthy cities to the west of Cuba, despite warnings that he might act against his superiors' interests. Cortes, with his resolve and spirit, defied orders and set sail, determined to claim his destiny.|"[""1.

"The truth must be acknowledged. Three factors led to the downfall of the vast empire this expedition faced. Cortes, Malinal, and the sixteen horses played significant roles. Fiske noted the Spanish soldiers' strength, armor, weapons, and horses were formidable. The horses, in particular, instilled paralyzing fear among the natives. After stopping at various locations and rescuing a Spanish captive, Geronimo de Aguilar, only two expedition members survived. Landing at Tabasco, a fierce battle ensued, with the artillery aiding in the Tabascans' defeat. Cortes' horsemen struck terror, causing the Tabascans to surrender. Peace was established, and Malinal, who spoke multiple languages, became crucial for communication. She learned Castilian and was baptized as Marina, serving Cortes devotedly. The Aztecs named Cortes ""Malinche,"" meaning the Lord of Malina, due to Marina's unwavering loyalty."|"['1.

Sir Arthur Helps praised Donna Marina for her loyalty and usefulness to her master, Cortes. Bernal Diaz described her as beautiful, intelligent, and always ready to help. Without her interpreting skills, Cortes' conquest of Mexico would not have been possible. The Aztec Empire, ruled by a military despot, was held together by fear and force. The capital, Tenochtitlan, was built on an island in a salt lake. The empire extended over vast territories, and its people were kept in check through ruthless measures. The Aztec religion was brutal, involving human sacrifice and cannibalism. The priests were savage, offering live hearts to their war god. The empire was marked by pyramids of skulls, a symbol of its violent practices.|"[""1.

On the peak stood a terrible block of jasper, shaped like a dome, where sacrifices took place. The victims were laid down with their chests pushed up for the priests to cut and take out their hearts. Nearby were altars and shrines for gods like Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli, with grotesque idols. Fresh human hearts were offered on these altars, while body parts were taken to the communal kitchens. The gods were insatiable, and many people were sacrificed. The temple was filled with rattlesnakes fed with the victims' entrails. Blood was used in rituals, and the temple was covered in blood and flesh. Outside, there was a structure with skulls on poles. The Spanish, though brutal, were not as cruel as the Aztecs in their religious practices. The Spanish soldiers were inspired by Christian ideals, with the Cross symbolizing their faith. In contrast, the Aztecs had a god named Quetzalcoatl, who preached peace and condemned human sacrifice.|['1.

The man's appearance, teachings, and behavior were so closely linked to Christianity that some believe he might have been a Christian Bishop who accidentally ended up in Mexico. Legend has it that he could have been a bishop blown off course while sailing near Europe, eventually landing in Mexico. He might have tried to teach the locals before attempting to sail back home. This story played a significant role in the upcoming conquest. Cortes, a determined and detail-oriented leader, swiftly integrated himself into the local political and social structure. He meticulously planned the city of Vera Cruz upon arrival, establishing a municipal government elected by his men. Cortes then relinquished his authority from Velasquez to this new organization, gaining more power and support for his expedition. With strategic moves like scuttling his ships to prevent retreat, Cortes solidified his control, amassing a formidable force to conquer the Aztec Empire.|"[""1.

Cortes, a complex figure of his time, was both a sincere Christian and a product of an era where Christian principles were often not reflected in actions. While he and his contemporaries believed in Christianity, their treatment of native peoples did not align with Christian values. Cortes, like many others, viewed the Aztecs as inferior and felt little obligation to keep promises made to them. He sought to spread Christianity through force and destruction, a common practice of the time. Unlike modern methods of persuasion, Cortes believed in compelling outsiders to accept Christianity, even if it meant shedding blood. His expedition to Mexico in 1519 was marked by caution and strategic alliances with groups opposed to Montezuma. By leveraging internal disaffection and superstitions, Cortes laid the groundwork for his conquest, marked by treachery and manipulation.|"[""1.

Montezuma, the Aztec ruler, faced a dilemma due to superstition. Many believed Cortes and his men were gods or the return of Quetzalcoatl. Some urged fighting, but Montezuma hesitated, sending gifts while discouraging their approach. Cortes, unlike other conquerors, sought more than treasure; he aimed to build an empire. As he advanced, he gained allies like the Tlascala Republic, a fierce tribe surrounded by the Aztec Empire. Despite lacking luxuries, the Tlascalans were skilled warriors, fiercely independent. Their alliance with Cortes became a crucial factor in the fall of Mexico. Ultimately, Montezuma's indecision and superstition, along with Cortes's ambition and strategic alliances, shaped the course of history in the conquest of Mexico.|"['1.

This city is remarkable, larger and stronger than Granada. It boasts an abundance of fine houses, a large population, and a rich supply of food including corn, fowls, game, fish, and vegetables. The bustling market engages thirty thousand people daily in trade, offering a variety of goods from food to clothing, shoes, gold, silver, precious stones, and feather ornaments. The city also provides earthenware, wood, coal, plants, and a well-organized police force. The people are rational and well-mannered, with a government similar to Venice, Genoa, and Pisa. In matters of justice, a thief was publicly punished according to local custom for stealing from a Spaniard. The city is home to many nobles and laborers, with a united front in times of war. The province houses around five hundred thousand inhabitants, with a neighboring republic called Guazincango. Montezuma allowed Tlascala to remain independent to provide a training ground for young Aztec warriors and a source of sacrifices for their gods. The Tlascalans, however, did not appreciate this arrangement and bore bitter enmity towards the Aztecs.

The descent from the mountains was relatively easy for the Spaniards, leading them to the city of Cholula, known for its grand pyramid temple, Teocalli.

The Spaniards were kept under watch after their provisions were abruptly cut off. Marina, a Cholulan woman, warned Cortes of the impending attack, allowing him to swiftly take action. Cortes gathered the Cholulan lords and attendants in his house, where he eliminated most of them. His troops also engaged in street battles, resulting in the infamous massacre of Cholula.

Mexico is a province shaped like a circle, surrounded by tall mountains, with two lakes within its boundaries. These lakes cover most of the valley and are navigated by boats for over fifty leagues. One lake has fresh water, while the other, larger one, has saltwater. A range of highlands divides the lakes, except for a narrow strait connecting them. The city of Temixtitan (Mexico) is located in the salt lake and is accessible by artificial causeways. The city is as large as Seville or Cordova, with wide, straight streets, some half-land and half-water, navigated by canoes. The city has public squares for markets, where a variety of goods are sold, including food, gold, silver, stones, feathers, and even medicinal herbs.

In the grand temple, there are three halls housing impressive idols of remarkable size and craftsmanship. Adorned with intricate stone and wood sculptures, these idols are placed in chapels with small doors, only accessible to a select few priests. Many idols are also found outside the chapels. The idols, believed to bring temporal prosperity, were replaced with images of Our Lady and the Saints to deter human sacrifices. The people were warned against expecting favors from idols and were urged to worship the one true God. Muteczuma and citizens were initially hesitant but eventually accepted the change. The city boasts magnificent houses, aqueducts distributing water, and a bustling market where laborers await employment. The people exhibit courtesy and elegance in their interactions, resembling the manners observed in Spain.

In the ruler's city, there was a palace with a stunning garden and marble-columned balconies. The palace could accommodate two high-ranking princes and their entourages.

On the morning of November 8th, 1519, Cortes rode into the city of Temixtitan to meet Montezuma. As Cortes describes it, he crossed a long causeway and was greeted by a fortress with two towers. A wooden bridge led them to the city, where Montezuma and his nobles welcomed them. The nobles wore rich costumes and performed a traditional greeting by kissing the ground. Cortes gifted Montezuma a pearl and diamond collar, and in return, Montezuma adorned Cortes with golden jewelry. Montezuma then led Cortes to a palace where they were to stay. He presented Cortes with various treasures and assured him of his loyalty. Montezuma dispelled myths about himself being a god and showed Cortes that he was mortal.

The Spaniards were overwhelmed with emotions as they encountered the grandeur of the Aztec city of Mexico. The sight of towering temples and edifices emerging from the water left them in awe, likening it to enchanted castles from legends. The meeting of two vastly different cultures sparked curiosity and fear in both parties. The Aztecs, amazed and apprehensive, welcomed the Spaniards with a mixture of admiration and dread. Despite the outward calm, underlying tensions simmered. The Spanish leader, Cortes, harbored a bold plan to seize the Aztec Emperor Montezuma, a treacherous scheme that would alter the course of history.

After a seemingly friendly visit to Mexico, Cortes found himself in a dilemma. He couldn't just leave without risking his own safety. Accusing Montezuma of ordering an attack on his men, Cortes demanded the Aztec Emperor accompany him to the pueblo. Despite Montezuma's protests, he was forced to comply, knowing any resistance would mean certain death. Surrounded by steel-clad Spaniards, Montezuma had no choice but to obey. Even though he was allowed to continue his duties as Emperor, he was under strict Spanish supervision. Meanwhile, the real culprit behind the attack, Cacique Quahpopoca, took the blame to protect Montezuma. Despite being cleared of any involvement, Montezuma was briefly put in irons, leaving a lasting impact on his spirit.

Cortes held his captive until spring, using the time wisely to explore the country's resources for future governance. This strategic approach set him apart from other conquerors, as he aimed to build an empire rather than plunder. When news of a Spanish force led by Narvaez reached Montezuma, Cortes swiftly acted. He surprised Narvaez, seizing him in a successful night attack despite being outnumbered. Meanwhile, Alvarado's brutal actions in Mexico City led to a rebellion. Cortes, reinforced by Narvaez's men, hurried back to quell the rebellion. Alvarado's rash behavior had escalated tensions, resulting in a siege on the Spaniards.

When the conqueror confronted Alvarado, he scolded him for his reckless actions. With little provision, Cortes mistakenly sent Cuitlahua, Montezuma's brother, to open markets for supplies. Cuitlahua seized power, deposing Montezuma and becoming emperor. The city faced a fierce attack, causing terror among the Spaniards. The slaughter was devastating, with cannons and horses creating chaos. Despite the losses, the Aztecs fought bravely. Montezuma, stripped of his titles, tried to calm the people, but they rebelled, pelting him with stones. Mortally wounded, Montezuma died in anguish.

During a fierce battle in Mexico, Montezuma, the Aztec ruler, was caught in the middle of a conflict between his people and the Spanish soldiers. Despite his attempts to calm the situation, he was severely wounded by his own people. Montezuma's gracious demeanor and fine manners were noted by those around him, even in the face of such chaos. His death, whether from his wounds or the shame inflicted upon him, left a mark on both the Spaniards and his own people. Meanwhile, Cortes, the Spanish leader, faced mutiny and rebellion within his own ranks as they fought against the Aztecs. In a desperate attempt to gain control, Cortes led his men in an intense battle to capture the temple of the war-god, facing fierce resistance from the Aztecs who fought with fanaticism and despair.

After a fierce battle, the Spanish soldiers conquered the temple. They toppled the war-god statue, angering the Aztecs. Many Spaniards lay dead, wounded, and exhausted. The Aztecs retaliated, attempting to set fire to the buildings and launching attacks. Despite their efforts, the Spaniards were struggling. Cortes decided to retreat, knowing they couldn't hold the city. The soldiers faced starvation, sickness, and constant attacks. They prepared to escape, leaving behind most of their treasures. Cortes warned that those carrying less would have a better chance of survival. They planned to flee over a makeshift bridge as the Aztecs had removed the usual ones. The night of July 1, 1520, dark and rainy, marked their escape attempt. With soldiers and allies, they set out - 1250 Spaniards and 6000 Tlascalans, divided into three groups.

"The third gap was crossed using the same risky method as the previous two. The distance from the third opening to the mainland was short. The few who made it rushed towards the shore. Alvarado was the last to cross, facing the pursuers alone after his horse was killed. A strange current in the lake swept away the bodies of the fallen. Recognizing Alvarado, the Aztecs saw him as a valuable sacrifice. With fierce cries, they charged at him. Despite his injuries and loss of blood, Alvarado, like Ney, made a daring leap to safety.

Shortly before midnight, the Spaniards embarked on a secretive march. They managed to lay down a pontoon over the first bridge, allowing the vanguard led by Sandoval and Cortes with his men to cross. However, the Mexicans were alerted by loud shouts and blowing horns, quickly deploying canoes on the lake. Chaos ensued as horses slipped into the water, and the Mexicans fiercely attacked the Spaniards. Despite the confusion, Cortes found a shallow area for his men to pass safely.

Among the men who followed Narvaez was a Black man who carried smallpox germs, which spread to the Aztecs in the city. It affected everyone, including their leader, Cuitlahua. The electors picked his nephew, Guatemoc, to take over. Guatemoc quickly gathered his troops and attacked Cortes and the Tlascalans in the Otumba valley. Cortes had to fight almost alone, with a noose around his neck. The Spaniards and their allies fought all day. Victory was crucial to avoid torture and death. Cortes led the way, killing the Aztec general and seizing their flag. Tlascala sided with Cortes, providing troops, horses, and guns.

Guatemoc, the Aztec leader, actively prepared for the Spanish siege. He gathered loyal tribes, especially those to the west, and tried to sway those who supported Cortes. The city of Mexico was readied for a siege as vast numbers of allies congregated. The Aztecs, alongside their Tlascalan allies, were resolute in their defense. When Cortes finally arrived in April the following year, he confronted the city with a force comprising Spanish infantry, arquebuses, horsemen, cannon, and Tlascalan fighters. The city was connected by three causeways, each side being attacked by a division of Cortes' army. The Aztecs valiantly fought, even though they were eventually left alone by their allies. Cortes strategically cut off the city's water supply and launched a fierce attack, utilizing brigantines to defeat the Aztec canoes.

During their arduous journey, the crew faced numerous challenges. A plank in the mate's boat had to be fixed while risking their lives. The captain's boat was damaged by a killer whale but was repaired. They ran out of food, surviving on spoiled salt bread until they found relief in fresher supplies.

In a historic duel, General Jackson and Dickinson faced off. Dickinson fired first, but Jackson stood unharmed. Surprised, Dickinson hesitated. When Jackson took aim, his pistol misfired. He re-cocked, aimed again, and shot Dickinson. Jackson, hit in the chest, concealed his wound. Years later, he recalled the incident with regret. In another duel, Decatur and Barron clashed over past grievances. Despite Decatur's reluctance, he accepted Barron's challenge. Decatur aimed to wound, not kill. Both men fired simultaneously.

In August 1829, a notorious duel took place on a Mississippi River island near Natchez. Dr. Maddox faced Samuel Wells in a duel witnessed by men involved in a land dispute. The duel's seconds and spectators soon engaged in a brawl. Judge Crane and James Bowie, armed only with a knife, became embroiled. Crane shot Bowie's friend, Currey, who later succumbed to his injuries. Crane then wounded Bowie, who continued the fight. Despite being wounded, Bowie fought back fiercely. The skirmish resulted in the deaths of six men and severe injuries to fifteen others. Bowie, known for his dueling prowess, later died heroically at the Alamo. Another tragic duel occurred between Major Thomas Biddle and Congressman Spencer Pettis in 1831, leading to both men's deaths. Similarly, a political dispute led to the fatal duel between Congressmen Jonathan Cilley and William J. Graves in 1838 near the District of Columbia. Cilley's untimely death highlighted the senselessness of such confrontations.|"['1.

In the past, disagreements sometimes led to duels, which were serious and often dangerous. For example, in a historic American duel, Senator Broderick and ex-Chief Justice Terry clashed due to political differences in 1859. Broderick, known for his anti-slavery stance, faced accusations from Terry after a defeat in his campaign. Their friendship soured, and harsh words were exchanged. Similarly, in another incident, Cilley and Graves found themselves in a duel over a challenge that escalated needlessly. Despite efforts to resolve the conflict, Graves insisted on a duel, leading to tragic consequences.

In the past, duels were a common way for people to settle disputes. One such duel took place between Terry and Broderick. The initial challenge led to a meeting on September 12th, but the police intervened, and both parties were released as no crime had been committed. The next day, they met again at Lake Merced, with pistols set at ten paces. Broderick's pistol had a hair trigger, and despite being warned, his shot missed. Terry, on the other hand, shot Broderick in the lung. Despite the seriousness of the situation, some onlookers managed to prevent further violence. In a different setting, Lieutenant Thorn, a skilled navigator with a war record, was chosen by John Jacob Astor to lead the Pacific Fur Company's expedition to Astoria in 1810.|"['1.

Hunt was to lead an overland trip from St. Louis while the Scots sailed around the Horn. They would meet at the Columbia River mouth for the trading post. The majority of the company's staff were experienced Canadians in the fur trade, including French _voyageurs_. The _Tonquin_ set sail with a diverse crew under the American flag, carrying Scottish and French Canadians, and a Russian. The ship had 23 crew members and 33 passengers. The journey is detailed in the captain's letters to Mr. Astor and a French journal by M. Gabriel Franchere. Thorn, the captain, had biases against various nationalities on board, leading to tensions. Despite conflicts, the voyage continued, marred by ongoing disputes and Thorn's high-handed behavior towards the partners.|"['1.

A journey around Cape Horn was a significant undertaking. The ship, Tonquin, was a fast sailor, but it wasn't until October 5th that they saw the Cape Verde Islands. They caught the Trade Winds and sped along the African coast. During this time, they were chased by a large warship but managed to evade it. On October 11th, they encountered a severe storm that lasted until the 21st, when they reached the River Plate. Despite the storm causing injuries to a crew member, Captain Thorn's seamanship skills stood out. Due to low water supplies, they made a stop at the Falkland Islands on December 3rd. After some challenges, they found fresh water and spent time fishing and exploring the island. Later, some passengers were left stranded on the island, but a daring rescue attempt saw them saved. The journey continued, facing more challenges before reaching the Sandwich Islands in February 1811.|"['1.

Captain Thorn faced animosity from the passengers and officers, but surprisingly, the crew seemed to like him. However, there were exceptions. Anderson, the boatswain, left due to conflicts with the captain. A troubling incident occurred when a sailor named Aymes was left behind during a boat trip. In fear, Aymes returned in a canoe, only to face the captain's harsh discipline. Thorn beat Aymes with a sugar cane, threatening him before tossing him overboard. The crew encountered a severe storm, and as they approached land, the captain sent a boat to scout the area. Unfortunately, the boat, led by First-Mate Ebenezer Fox, was lost in the treacherous waters. Despite warnings, Thorn's decision resulted in a tragic outcome.|"[""1.

The following day, the wind grew stronger as the crew sailed along the shore in search of their lost boat. Even the stern captain was visibly disturbed by the loss. On the 24th, the weather calmed a bit, allowing them to anchor near Cape Disappointment. Mumford, the second mate, attempted to search for a passage but had to return due to rough surf. McKay and Stuart then tried to reach shore but faced difficulties with the breakers. Later, a gentle breeze aided Thorn in crossing the bar. Despite challenges, they managed to anchor safely in Baker's Bay. The next morning, the captain and some partners landed and found Weeks, who shared a tragic tale of loss at sea.

The battle at sea between the _Richard_ and the _Serapis_ was intense. The _Richard_ was severely damaged, but Captain Jones, a brave American commander, showed remarkable leadership. Despite the _Alliance_ accidentally firing on the _Richard_, Captain Jones managed to defeat the _Serapis_. The English captain, Pearson, eventually surrendered. Captain Jones, although facing many challenges, including poor ships and crews, was a determined and skilled sailor. His legacy lives on through his famous words and his unwavering commitment to freedom. Unfortunately, Captain Jones never had the opportunity to command a proper ship during the American Revolution.

In 1775, J. Paul Jones set sail on the first American warship. During the Revolution, he engaged in twenty-three sea battles, raided Britain and its colonies seven times, captured two British ships of equal strength and two stronger ones, along with numerous supply vessels. His actions led Britain to fortify its ports, cease cruel burnings in America, and exchange American prisoners held as 'traitors' in English prisons. Despite being accused of piracy, Jones' legacy is now celebrated. An unsolved mystery surrounds his life, particularly why he adopted the name 'Jones.' Two theories exist: one suggesting he inherited the name, while the other proposes it was out of admiration for the Jones family of North Carolina. The true reason remains unknown, adding intrigue to Jones' remarkable story.|"['1. What did J.

Colonel Buell brought to my attention that there is no mention of the North Carolina Jones family in Paul Jones's letters to Joseph Hewes. Jones and Hewes met through business before Jones settled in America. To clarify this, I contacted all Virginia county clerks along the Rappahannock River, inquiring about the will of William Paul or William Paul Jones. Unfortunately, many records were lost during the Civil War. Luckily, Spottsylvania County's records, where Fredericksburg is located, were preserved. The will of William Paul, dated 1772, leaves his property to his sister Mary Young in Scotland, without mentioning William Jones. William Paul passed away in 1774, contrary to previous beliefs. Despite thorough investigations, no evidence supports the claim that William Paul assumed the name Jones. Additionally, Colonel Cadwallader Jones of North Carolina attests that his grandmother, Mrs. Willie Jones, confirmed the name change story.|"[""1.

Descendants from various branches of the Jones family have independently shared the same account. One example is Mr. Armistead Churchill Gordon from Staunton, Va., who heard the story from his great-aunt, a relative of Mrs. Jones. Additional lines of tradition further support the credibility of the theory. For instance, if Jones acted on behalf of his sister in settling his brother's estate, he likely had to provide a bond for his responsibilities. It is mentioned that Willie and Allen Jones stood as sureties for him. Colonel Buell argued that John Paul Jones gained wealth and influence in Virginia after his brother's passing, but this assertion is refuted in the _Virginia Historical Magazine_. The evidence suggests that Jones did not amass riches, aligning with the North Carolina tradition. The direct testimony, even if passed through only one generation, holds weight. This account contributes a fresh perspective to history and settles the debate on why John Paul adopted the surname Jones.|"[""1.

The high points mentioned later turned out to be full of secret caves and underground tunnels. These volcanic mounds had four natural strongholds that the Indians had fortified using the natural landscape. The forts were connected by a maze of crevices, passages, and caves, allowing the defenders to move easily between them. The main fort faced northeast and was surrounded by a deep gorge and a wall of rock. The area around the forts had natural pits that served as cover. When General Crook and his small force approached, the Indians, led by Chief Sa-hei-ta, were confident in their defenses. Crook strategically positioned his troops to surround the Indians, engaging in a fierce battle throughout the day. By nightfall, the soldiers had cleared the plateau of Indians, who retreated into the forts. Crook planned to storm the forts at dawn after a night of sporadic gunfire exchanges.|['1.

First Lieutenant W. R. Parnell, now living in San Francisco, led the cavalry in the assault. Second Lieutenant John Madigan, also from the cavalry, oversaw the infantry's support. The troops were instructed to cautiously approach the crevasses near the fort, swiftly descend, scale the rocky walls, and breach the fort's defenses. General Crook advised them to shout and cheer to intimidate the enemy. Despite the dangerous task, the soldiers bravely followed their orders. At dawn, they charged the fort, dodging enemy fire. Parnell's company scaled the cliffs, while Madigan's men circled to find a safer descent. Tragically, Madigan was fatally shot. The soldiers, aided by each other, climbed the cliffs and breached the fort's walls. The Indians inside were overwhelmed, leading to their retreat. The fort was defended by around fifty Indians, resulting in fifteen casualties.|"[""1. What was First Lieutenant W. R.

The soldiers rushed to the western wall, firing at the Indians who had gathered at the other forts. The Indians retaliated fiercely. In the morning, an infantryman removed a weed obstructing his view, exposing himself and getting shot in the head. The wounded were taken to camp around 11 A.M. Crook led a retreat for breakfast as the Indians attacked. After a fierce exchange, the soldiers regained control. The soldiers spent the day defending the fort while the Indians tried to take it. By nightfall, the dead were retrieved, and the soldiers reoccupied the fort. The Indians used a secret underground passage to escape undetected. Crook's losses were severe, with many casualties. The soldiers buried their fallen comrades and returned to Camp Warner.|"['1.

Crook bravely faced the Indians with a smaller army on their chosen battleground. Despite the Indians' belief that their position was unassailable, Crook defeated them decisively. The daring assault on the ravine's wall, breaching the rampart, storming the fort, defending it, abandoning it, and recapturing it was a heroic feat in American history. Although the victory came at a high cost, it taught the Indians a valuable lesson, leading to the eventual peace in the region. Today, this remarkable exploit is largely forgotten. The story is pieced together from surviving officer Colonel Parnell's papers, official reports, and scarce newspaper and book accounts. The narrator recalls being the eldest son in a large family, inheriting his father's meticulously maintained clothes, which he had to wear out, unlike his younger brother who always seemed to escape this fate. The vivid memory of a humiliating plum-colored coat that did not fit properly and a pair of stiff, ill-suited cream trousers stands out from his childhood wardrobe.|"[""1.

Long ago, I owned a remarkable pair of cream-colored pants that stood out for their color, quality, and style. They resembled the wide-seated, peg-top fashion of today. One hot August day, while playing near Duffy's Pond, we were caught by Mr. Duffy, who disapproved of us swimming in his pond. In a panic, we fled through mud, getting dirtier by the second. Mr. Duffy, armed with a shotgun, chased us, firing beans at our fleeing figures. We ran like the wind, escaping his wrath. Despite our efforts to clean up with grass and leaves, my once pristine cream-colored pants were irreversibly stained by the thick, black mud of the pond.

I looked quite gloomy. Even a leopard changing its spots seemed easier than me. I recall feeling a mix of intense joy and fear. Upon arriving home for dinner, my father's astonishment was clear. After being thoroughly cleaned and having a serious talk with my father in the woodshed, I learned my lesson. Although I never wore those cream-colored pants again, the adventure had a positive outcome. The fabric was repurposed into a quilt and a jacket, but my mother couldn't help but shed tears when she saw them. Grown-ups can be so thoughtless about a boy's attire!

Two of us recall carrying large tubs up a steep bank from the river at 4 A.M. to water the elephants when the circus visited town.

We used to release our two game-cocks several times a day. They would charge at each other fiercely, but we would separate them before they could start a real fight, returning them to their coops facing each other. They would then exchange chicken insults freely. Their desire for combat was intense, leading them to clash like two speeding trains whenever released. They wasted no time in posturing, immediately engaging in a battle. We only allowed them a brief scuffle before ending it. One day, when we were away, Charles, seeking revenge, released them. Upon our return, we found only one chicken, a valiant survivor after defeating the other. We held a solemn ceremony, burning the fallen bird like a gladiator.
