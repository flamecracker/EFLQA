On a lively Saturday afternoon in January, a group of boys gathered by a large pond in Groveton village. Among them was their teacher, Frederic Hooper, who had a special challenge in mind. Holding a Waterbury watch, he announced a skating competition. The prize? The watch for the boy who skated across the pond and back in the shortest time. The confident Randolph Duncan, son of the wealthy town official, Prince Duncan, was eager to prove his skills. In contrast, Luke Larkin, a hardworking boy from a humble background, was determined to compete. Despite Randolph's boasting about his expensive skates, Luke remained focused on the challenge ahead. As the boys prepared for the race, the competition between social classes and skating abilities was about to unfold on the frozen pond.|['1.

Luke, disappointed, had a fair chance to win a watch he desired. His friends, Tom and Sam, favored Randolph, hoping he would give Luke the Waterbury watch if he won. Despite Randolph's usual stinginess, they held onto hope. During a skating race, Luke, a superior skater, was about to beat Randolph.

Tom observed Randolph's smug expression and felt a sense of ingratitude towards his friend. Despite risking much to help Randolph, Tom hoped to at least receive the promised watch. Luke, trying to diffuse the tension, generously offered the watch to Randolph, acknowledging his victory in the race. As Randolph left, Tom reluctantly accompanied him, feeling disdain towards Randolph's behavior. Reflecting on the situation, Tom decided not to give the watch to Randolph, feeling unappreciated. Disappointed but not in a rush to return home, Luke borrowed skates and spent time skating with other boys. The story then shifts to Luke's modest home, where he and his mother managed with a meager income. Luke's daily tasks included caring for the schoolhouse and doing odd jobs for neighbors.

Luke set out on a marked day for a skating match, which turned out disappointing.

At home, his mother suggested buying a watch with the money, but Luke declined, satisfied with his skating performance. Later, he encountered Randolph flaunting the prize watch and Florence Grant, a popular girl in town.

"Luke was happy to receive a compliment and relieved that he didn't embarrass himself in front of his critic, Randolph Duncan. He performed well in the second dance with Florence. In the Virginia Reel, Florence danced with Linton, and Luke danced with a skilled partner. Luke positioned himself carefully and did a good job by observing closely.

"Melinda hesitated, torn between loyalty and duty. The missing box, she suspected, was the same one she glimpsed in Mrs. Larkin's trunk. Despite Luke and his mother's composed demeanor, Melinda sensed a hidden truth in their exchanged glances. Determined to uncover the mystery, Melinda decided to confide in Squire Duncan at the bank.

At the bank, a meeting was convened with Mr. Manning, Mr. Bailey, and Mr. Beane, all Groveton residents. Mr. Beane urged Luke to explain how he came into possession of the box.

Mr. Duncan scolded Mr. Denton for losing a thousand dollars due to his foolishness. But then, Mr. Duncan had an idea. He thought of framing the billiard-saloon keeper for the stolen bonds that Tony Denton had used. This plan could shift the blame away from Denton. However, Mr. Duncan also pondered that the bonds might not be traceable if their numbers were not recorded. He decided to wait and see how things unfolded. Meanwhile, Linton received a letter from his friend Luke, who was away on a secret mission. Luke shared his success and mentioned his return to Groveton soon.
