It is remarkable that two men of the same age, entering Congress together and sharing similar aims and ambitions, never had a misunderstanding in their 18 years of friendship. This strong bond led to a successful partnership. The new Administration began with three former teachers as its highest officers, including President Garfield, Vice-President Arthur, and Mr. Blaine, who were all successful educators. In this country, many public figures have served as teachers before entering politics. Unfortunately, the Administration faced a tragic event when President Garfield was assassinated by a political opportunist who sought personal gain. The nation mourned deeply, and even abroad, the sympathy was universal. England, in particular, expressed profound grief, with the Queen extending her sympathy.
