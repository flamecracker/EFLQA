Thirteen girls would have been intrigued to see the eight boys disembark as a group, cautiously scanning the depot for familiar faces. Relieved by the lack of recognition, the boys swiftly boarded a waiting streetcar, heading southwest through the city's business area and then west towards High Peak. Passing by the mining colony's northern edge, the car veered north through a prosperous residential zone. All eight boys sported Scout uniforms, forming the complete Spring Lake patrol under leader Ernest Hunter.

Before entering the cave, Ernie, the patrol leader, asked four boys to stay back and watch the car. The rest, including Ernie, Clifford, Harry, Gilbert, and Jerry, ventured into the cave.

They rested briefly, setting up a makeshift table with a lamp. However, their peace was interrupted when Johnnie Two Times returned with urgent news.

Ernie instructed Paul and Jerry to head home and stay put until morning due to rough terrain and impending darkness.

"""Oh, Johnny Twice!"" moaned Earl Hamilton. ""Don't ruin your good deed by playing any more pranks. You're being unfair by distracting us when we can't afford to stop and deal with you."" Their pace shifted between a brisk walk and a sprint, depending on their stamina. Paul and Jerry struggled to keep up with the others, especially over rocky or icy terrain.

The area was frozen and snowy, bordered by a stone quarry and trees. A distant car's lights indicated its approach, climbing a steep hill.

"While speaking, two masked villains suddenly emerged from the woods and stood in front of the car, aiming pistols at the driver. The driver, following a plan discovered by ""Johnny Two-Times,"" slowed down before the robbers appeared. Upon their command to stop, he halted and raised his hands. The patrol leader then gave a signal, and the boys swiftly shone their flashlights on their faces to reveal their identities to Mr. Stanlock.

Mr. Stanlock marveled at the stove inside the cave, a blend of nature and civilization. He planned to visit soon. The machine they rode could carry up to eleven in dire situations. To make the trip more fun, they attached a sled made by a student for Mr. Stanlock's son. Despite a bumpy ride, the boys enjoyed it. Arriving near the cave, they left the car and headed to the Scouts' base. Mr. Stanlock, nostalgic for his youth, wanted to spend time with the young hunters. As they discussed an attack by highwaymen, they found a note implicating their driver. Unsure of his driver's loyalty, Mr. Stanlock contemplated his next steps.

The rush at the entrance caused a bit of delay, but luckily, it wasn't serious. Some boys were fast sprinters. As they came out of the cave, the driver was close.

A short ride brought Helen to the mining area. She checked her note for the address and asked the conductor for directions. He pointed her three blocks east to Heaver Street. Helen found the row of identical cottages and located number 632. Inside, a worn-out woman welcomed her. The house was modestly furnished with a rag rug and a hall-tree.
