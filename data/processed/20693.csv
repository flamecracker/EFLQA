Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Bab-ba who lived in a beautiful white house on the Simla Hills in India. Bab-ba had a black Ayah named Jeejee-walla who took care of him. He played with his pets, Mioux-Mioux the cat, and Wooff-Wooff the dog on the verandah. Every morning, Bab-ba fed bread crumbs to the birds in the garden, and they sang songs about him. One day, a wicked snake named Hoodo tried to harm the birds, but Bab-ba bravely called for help. Hoodo sought revenge by plotting with Tig the Tiger and Prowl the Wolf to capture Bab-ba.
