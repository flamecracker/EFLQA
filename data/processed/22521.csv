In the town where I went to a boarding school, there was a big gymnasium managed by a former circus performer. He taught boys basic exercises, but an agile English student convinced me to try advanced acrobatics with him. The instructor, who had circus experience, trained us for free, reminiscing about his past. At the end of term, we thanked him with five dollars each. He assured us we could perform in a circus. Kit and I practiced challenging stunts together. Despite the acrobat's attempts to unbalance us, we remained steady. I might leave school soon for work, as hinted by Ralph, and my uncle has news for me. My father lost money in Wall Street due to risky investments, leading him to borrow from others.|['1.

Kit's uncle had a tough decision to make when his brother asked for money. Despite feeling weak, he lent the money to his brother, fearing his ruin otherwise. Kit's uncle admitted to being vulnerable, as he could lose everything with only his brother's notes as repayment. He explained to Kit that he kept his financial support secret to avoid making Kit feel indebted. However, due to financial constraints, Kit would have to stop school and find work. Kit's uncle hoped to provide equal opportunities for both Kit and his own son. Meanwhile, Kit's uncle worried about Kit's reaction and whether he would suspect anything amiss.

At the circus, the show began with a grand procession of elephants and horses, followed by daring bareback riders and acrobats who amazed the audience with their stunts. The crowd was thrilled until a deep roar sent shivers down everyone's spine. A lion had escaped and was now in the ring, causing panic among the spectators. Despite the danger, Kit, armed with an unusual weapon - a quarter pound of snuff, bravely stepped into the arena to face the ferocious lion. With only six feet between them, Kit knew the lion needed more space to attack. His quick thinking and unique choice of weapon showed his courage and determination to survive the perilous encounter.|[]|[]
The lion paused, impressed by the boy's boldness. Its eyes glared menacingly, preparing to strike fear. The tense moment felt like an eternity to the silent crowd. Kit, facing the lion, sensed the growing danger. Unable to retreat, he swiftly tossed snuff at the lion, blinding it and causing agony. The circus staff subdued the suffering lion as the audience erupted in cheers for Kit's bravery. Despite feeling nervous under the spotlight, Kit was hailed a hero.

Kit was enjoying the circus performance while giving little thought to how his actions might be perceived by Ralph, with whom he had a strained relationship despite being close companions out of necessity for many years. That night, Kit couldn't sleep, feeling angry and indignant towards his uncle for the stark contrast between his future and his cousin's. Despite excelling in studies, he couldn't understand why he wasn't as qualified as Ralph to pursue a career as a merchant or lawyer. The circus tent had been dismantled late at night for transportation to another town. Mr. Barlow, the circus owner, cautioned Kit about joining the business due to its temptations. Kit, considering a blacksmith's life distasteful, found solace in the idea of traveling with the circus, where he could enjoy light duties and good pay. When a visitor arrived, Kit, despite feeling slighted by his uncle, remained composed, concealing his plan for the future.|"['1.

Kit had made a firm decision to start a new chapter in his life, away from the stingy blacksmith. As they approached Oakford, Mr. Bickford warned Kit about the plain fare at his home, contrasting it with the luxurious meals Kit was accustomed to.

Kit hesitated at the idea. He had seen bars of yellow soap at the store and wasn't keen on using it. He also didn't like the thought of sharing a towel with the blacksmith and his wife. The towel hanging by the sink seemed like it had been used for a week. Kit's uncle wanted him to leave because he had spent a lot on him and now wanted him to learn a trade. The blacksmith, Mr. Bickford, chased Kit and another boy after they ran away. Kit, though tired from carrying his heavy valise, was determined not to give up. Mr. Bickford, being used to hard work, slowly closed in on the boys as they headed towards the circus tents. Despite being tired, Kit was determined not to be caught.|"[""1.

The boys had expected the blacksmith's move and were ready. When the blacksmith entered the field, the boys, being lighter and quicker, had already crossed to the other side. Although Aaron Bickford was strong from his work at the forge, Kit, a strong boy himself, was no match for him. The blacksmith planned to take Kit home in his wagon, holding onto his collar until then. However, Achilles Henderson intervened, shaking the blacksmith until he let go. Achilles advised the blacksmith to leave promptly to avoid further trouble. Achilles then headed to a nearby tent at the circus where a plate of hot steak and potatoes was being brought in. Earlier, the boys had breakfast, finding the tough steak and mediocre coffee quite satisfying. They enjoyed the meal, conversing with Mlle. Louise, who was very friendly.|"['1.

Kit was amazed by the clown's words. He couldn't believe this was the same comical man who had entertained the crowd just an hour ago.

He was humiliated in front of Kit and William Morris, getting tossed over a fence by William. Despite this, Mr. Bickford decided to take his wife to the circus to reclaim Kit, his runaway apprentice.

William stifled a laugh, imagining Mr. Bickford's reaction when he discovered the trick played on him. The blacksmith mistook William's gurgle for sobbing and comforted him, advising him to learn a trade instead of running away with the circus.

"Dear Christopher,

I was surprised and disappointed to hear that you had left Mr. Bickford's house to join the circus.

Stephen Watson remained silent as Kit spoke, his expression a mix of panic and uncertainty. Finally, in a hoarse voice, he denied the accusations, calling them outrageous falsehoods and schemes to rob him. He threatened Kit to leave immediately, even though he had initially allowed him to stay until Saturday. Henry Miller intervened sternly, revealing that they had proof of Stephen's fraudulent actions regarding Kit's inheritance. They had enlisted a lawyer and gave Stephen a choice: surrender or face a legal battle. Henry made it clear that Stephen's deceit was transparent and that he had taken advantage of Kit's trusting nature. Despite the evidence against him, they offered Stephen a chance for a fresh start. Kit promised to support Stephen financially, ensuring he wouldn't starve and even offering to cover his education expenses. Henry emphasized that this generosity was more than Stephen deserved and that he should be grateful to Kit for the opportunity he was being given.|"[""1.
