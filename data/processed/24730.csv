Father Boone and the boys dismounted the horses while Mother Boone and the girls descended from the wagon. They tended to the horses and the cow before setting up a campfire. Father and the boys began felling trees to construct a log house. Before long, the Boones had a new dwelling in the unfamiliar territory. Time passed, and Daniel grew taller and broader, with fair hair and blue eyes, embodying a lean and rugged appearance. He roamed the woods of the Yadkin Valley, returning home with deer and bear meat. Daniel's neighbors praised his exceptional marksmanship.

When Daniel returned to Yadkin Valley, he married Rebecca Bryan. Daniel enjoyed teasing her and once playfully cut her apron. He farmed in spring and summer, hunted in autumn, and trapped in winter, providing food and furs for his family. In 1769, Daniel, John Finley, and four others journeyed to Kentucky. They rode horses through Cumberland Gap, marvelling at Kentucky's beauty. Though only seeing a few Indians, they found lush meadows, winding rivers, and majestic mountains. While some hunters got scared and returned, Daniel, Squire (his brother), and Alexander Neeley stayed. Squire promised to join later with supplies.

During their hunting trips, the men would split up. They would regroup every two weeks. One time, Boone's brother-in-law didn't return. He never did. Five years later, a skeleton with a powder horn was found near a tree. It's believed he may have been hurt by an Indian, but the truth remains a mystery. Neeley, feeling scared, decided to head home alone. Meanwhile, Daniel and Squire stayed behind, hunting and trapping until they had plenty of skins. Squire eventually went back to sell the skins and get more supplies. Daniel, content in the wilderness with his rifle Tick-Licker, explored Kentucky freely. After a while, Squire returned, and the brothers continued hunting together. Two years later, Daniel Boone felt it was time to move to Kentucky. He, along with his family and six other families, packed their belongings and journeyed on foot alongside their livestock, eager for a new adventure in the wild and beautiful land.|"[""1.

When the Boone families heard the news, they decided not to move to Kentucky. Instead, they turned back and traveled over the mountains. The Boones were saddened by James' death, but Daniel remained determined to fulfill his dream of settling in Kentucky. He ensured the safety of his wife and children in a secure location, not returning all the way to the Yadkin Valley. Concerned about the increasing number of white men moving west and the Indians protecting their hunting grounds, Daniel and a companion ventured into Kentucky to warn surveyors working there. Most of the surveyors managed to escape unharmed, leading to a temporary peace in Kentucky. Meanwhile, a wealthy man named Richard Henderson planned to purchase Kentucky from the Indians to establish a new colony. Boone, having discussed the idea with the Indians, believed they would agree to sell the land. Henderson arranged a meeting with the Cherokees at Sycamore Shoals in present-day Tennessee. Despite having legal representation, the Cherokees agreed to trade Kentucky to Henderson for a fraction of its actual value. They cautioned Henderson about hostile Indians from the west and north. The construction of the famous Wilderness Road began, which would later be used by settlers with their belongings. Initially, Boone and his team followed Indian trails and buffalo paths, clearing a path through the woods with axes and vigilantly watching for any hostile Indian activity.|"['1.

The group of men journeyed until they reached the banks of the Kentucky River, where they started constructing a fort. Daniel Boone was aware that the Shawnees and other tribes did not recognize Henderson's claim to Kentucky. He returned to fetch his family, including his youngest daughter, Jemima. On a Sunday afternoon, Jemima and two friends ventured out on a canoe ride, despite the rule to stay close to the fort. As they paddled, they were ambushed by five Indians who planned to take them as slaves. Back at the fort, the disappearance was noticed after dark. Boone, without hesitation, grabbed his gun and along with three young men, pursued the Indians.

Boone gained fame as a hero in the Kentucky Wilderness. One winter, he and some men went to salt springs to collect salt. While there, Boone encountered Chief Blackfish and his Shawnee warriors heading to Boonesborough. The Shawnee believed the land belonged to them and were influenced by the British during the American Revolution. Boone negotiated to bring his people peacefully in the spring. However, he was captured and adopted by Chief Blackfish as Big Turtle. Soon after, a battle ensued between the Shawnee and the settlers at Boonesborough, with women and children aiding in the defense.

During the intense fighting that lasted eight days and nights, the Indians set the cabins on fire with flaming torches, leaving the fort dry and exhausted. Dark skies loomed until rain finally fell, extinguishing the flames and replenishing the water supply. The settlers regained hope as peace slowly returned after the American Revolution. More pioneers ventured westward, following the Wilderness Road and navigating the Ohio River on flatboats. They hunted, farmed, and built communities.
