Meanwhile, a war-party of Blackfeet Indians camped near the fort, hinting at trouble. Reverend Tucker, a strong believer in physical and spiritual health, rode out and encountered the war-party. Despite the delay caused by Tucker's absence, preparations continued for the wedding. Reuben Dale, the groom, dressed in hunting attire, and Loo, the bride, looked lovely in a simple outfit.

Kenneth MacFearsome stood before his friends, ready to speak on the special occasion. But before he could start, Reuben, a bold hunter, interrupted. He expressed concern for his friend Jacob Strang, who was missing. Just then, Jacob burst in, carrying the Reverend William Tucker on his shoulders. Jacob had rescued the pastor from a group of Blackfeet who had captured him. The Blackfeet had planned to attack the Fort from two sides, and while MacFearsome chased one group, the other, larger band attacked. The men left behind to guard the Fort, along with the women assisting, prepared for the assault. Mr. Tucker, armed with an axe-handle, stood at the gate, ready to defend.

Late for a conference, Mr. Tucker rushes to repel an enemy assault. During the chaos, three Blackfeet sneak to the front gate. Mr. Tucker intervenes, subduing two but is attacked by the third.
