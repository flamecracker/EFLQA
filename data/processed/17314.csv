At the gravel-pits, the children found themselves alone as their parents hurried away on urgent errands. The house felt eerily quiet, prompting the siblings to venture out with their spades and the little Lamb in tow. Exploring the vast gravel-pit, resembling a giant washbowl with grassy edges and wildflowers, they engaged in imaginative play. While attempting to dig a tunnel to Australia, the children's hands grew sandy, faces shiny, and the Lamb drifted off to sleep in the midst of their castle-building. As they dug deeper, Jane, nicknamed Pussy, urged caution. Despite knowing Australia wasn't close, they continued with their hands, discovering shells and a mysterious object. Anthea's scream led to a startling find in the sand, leaving them all breathless with excitement.|"['1.

The voice agreed, and a peculiar creature emerged from the sand, furry and chubby. The children encircled the hole, gazing at the unique being before them. It had eyes like a snail's on long horns, ears resembling a bat's, and a tubby body akin to a spider's, all covered in soft fur. Its legs and arms were also furry, with hands and feet reminiscent of a monkey's. Anthea, in a friendly tone, asked the creature who it was, hoping to avoid angering it. The creature responded, expressing a willingness to converse civilly. It shared tales of a time when Sand-fairies granted wishes, mentioning creatures like Pterodactyls and Megatheriums. The Psammead, as it was called, explained that leftovers turned to stone at sunset and reminisced about living on the seashore when children built sand castles for them.|"[""1.

"""It's a sad story,"" said the Sand-fairy gloomily. ""The moats to the castles caused trouble. The sea would flood in, and when a Sand-fairy got wet, it would catch a cold and often die. So, there were fewer and fewer fairies. When you found one, you'd wish for a Megatherium to eat more because wishes were scarce."" The Sand-fairy shuddered, recalling a time it got wet. ""I scurried away to a warm, dry sand house and have stayed there since. Now, I won't say more."" The children, given three wishes, hesitated. Anthea remembered a private wish for her and Jane. The Sand-fairy offered one wish a day. The children, initially silent, recognized each other and agreed to share the wishes."|"['1.

Anthea and her siblings found themselves in a strange predicament after a wish made to the Sand-fairy. They were transformed into beautiful but unfamiliar versions of themselves, making it hard for them to recognize each other. The children struggled to make friends with their own baby brother, who was hungry and thirsty, causing chaos. Despite their attempts to seek help, the servants at the White House refused to let them in, leaving the siblings stranded and hungry. As they waited anxiously for sunset, fearing they might turn to stone, Cyril expressed his concern about feeling like he was turning to stone already. The children clung together, feeling lonely and alien in their transformed bodies, hoping for a way back to their old selves.|['1.

After a night of fear and hunger, the children finally found solace in sleep. Anthea was the first to wake, relieved that they were not turned to stone. She lovingly teased her siblings about their appearances, grateful for their safety. Martha scolded them for being out all day and warned them about interacting with strange children. Anthea woke from a dream about a rainy day at the zoo, only to find her brother waking her up with a wet towel. Robert shared his dream about being granted a wish and turning into beautiful beings, which they found unpleasant. Anthea and Robert realized they all had similar dreams and decided to make a wish together after breakfast, ensuring they all agreed on the wish beforehand.|['1.

The three children got dressed with astonishment on their faces. They couldn't shake the feeling that if the Sand-fairy dream was real, then getting dressed in reality felt like a dream. Jane agreed with Cyril's thoughts, but Anthea wasn't convinced until Martha, the servant, scolded them for their misbehavior the previous day. Anthea realized that servants only dream of things from the Dream-book like snakes, oysters, and weddings representing funerals. Jane imagined servants pretending their babies were noble dukes and duchesses. Martha, in her fancy purple dress and hat, and the Lamb in his cream-colored silk outfit, made a stylish group as they headed to the Cross Roads in a carrier's cart. They reached the spot where the Sand-fairy vanished and uncovered the fantastical creature. The Sand-fairy, with a spider-like body and odd features, expressed surprise at their presence. The children hesitated to answer the Sand-fairy's question, fearing it might affect their wishes.|"[""1.

"""We don't want you to worry about these things,"" said Cyril eagerly, while the others felt guilty and wished the Fairy would stop lecturing about good tempers. The Fairy offered them a choice between gold or notes, making its arms frighteningly long. The children ran towards the road as the sand-pit filled with shining gold pieces. Anthea politely wished the Fairy well before they left. The sight of the dazzling gold was too much for their eyes. They picked up the coins, feeling the weight and enjoying the chink they made. Cyril suggested filling their pockets and buying things before the gold vanished at sunset. They planned to hire a pony and cart to go to Rochester and spend the gold on heaps of items. They marveled at the coins with a man's head on one side and an ace of spades on the other, urging each other to fill their pockets and leave quickly."|"['Question 1: What did the Fairy offer the children to choose from?\nA) Silver or jewels\nB) Gold or notes\nC) Pearls or diamonds\nD) Gems or coins\nE) Rubies or banknotes', ""Question 2: How did the children feel about the Fairy's lecture on good tempers?\nA) Excited\nB) Guilty\nC) Happy\nD) Relieved\nE) Indifferent"", 'Question 3: What did Cyril suggest they do with the gold before it vanished at sunset?\nA) Save it for later\nB) Bury it in the sand-pit\nC) Spend it on items in Rochester\nD) Return it to the Fairy\nE) Share it with the villagers', 'Question 4: What did the children feel when they picked up the coins?\nA) Fear\nB) Excitement\nC) Disappointment\nD) Sadness\nE) Anger', ""Question 5: What did the coins have on one side?\nA) A king's head\nB) A queen's head\nC) A man's head\nD) A woman's head\nE) A child's head"", 'Question 6: What did the children plan to hire to go to Rochester?\nA) A boat\nB) A carriage\nC) A bicycle\nD) A hot air balloon\nE) A helicopter']"|"['B) Gold or notes', 'B) Guilty', 'C) Spend it on items in Rochester', 'B) Excitement', ""C) A man's head"", 'B) A carriage']"
Cyril and his siblings found themselves burdened with heavy gold coins after a mysterious adventure. The weight of the coins made their journey to the village under the scorching sun quite challenging. Jane, realizing they had more money than they could spend, decided to hide some gold coins along the way. As they trudged along, they each stashed away some of the gold. Despite their hidden wealth, they appeared like ordinary children. Upon reaching the village, they sat down outside an inn, where Cyril went in to buy ginger beer. The others waited outside, trying to quench their thirst by stretching out their tongues, only to end up thirstier. Cyril returned with ginger beer and treats, having paid with his own money since the inn wouldn't accept the gold coins.|"['1.

Anthea made a clever deal to hire a man named S. Crispin with a guinea to drive them to Rochester. The children enjoyed the ride in the pony-trap, planning how to spend the fairy money. In Rochester, they faced difficulties spending the guineas. Anthea tried to buy a hat but was refused because the money was not recognized. They then bought gloves with Cyril's money, as no one wanted to change the guineas. Hungry and tired, the children struggled to find a place that would accept their fairy gold for food or other items. It seemed the tradespeople were hesitant to accept the unfamiliar currency. The children learned that spending the fairy money was harder than they thought, contrary to what adults believed about money.|"['1. What did Anthea do to hire S.

After visiting two bakeries without success, the hungry children, possibly enticed by the aroma of fresh cake, concocted a plan in hushed tones and executed it boldly. They stormed into a third bakery owned by Beale, each child swiftly grabbing three new penny buns, squishing them together, and taking a hearty bite out of the triple-decker treat. The stunned staff were caught off guard as the children stood defiantly with their mouths full and hands clutching a dozen buns. Despite feeling grimy from their escapade, the children, now in the Castle Gardens, savored the currant-filled buns, which lifted their spirits. Encouraged by Jane's optimism and Anthea's determination, the group, though disheveled, headed to the Saracen's Head inn. Robert, taking the lead, confronted Mr. Peasemarsh about purchasing horses and carriages, brandishing a handful of gleaming guineas. However, their bold move backfired when Mr. Peasemarsh threatened legal action, leaving the children shocked and crestfallen. As they were escorted through the streets of Rochester, a familiar voice scolded Robert for his actions, adding to their distress.|"['1.

Martha, the children's caretaker, couldn't see the gold the Fairy had left for them. She thought they were playing a trick. The children knew Martha couldn't see the gold because of the Fairy's promise. When they reached the police station, the gold had vanished from their pockets. Martha, upset with the situation, took them home in a grand carriage. Despite her noble actions at the police station, she scolded the children for going to Rochester alone. They found the old gentleman they had promised to meet in the village, and he still had the guinea. Anthea felt guilty about the baker's guinea and sent postage stamps to pay for the buns.

The day after finding the Sand-fairy and making two wishes, the children woke up without the same joy. Beauty and wealth had not brought them happiness. During breakfast, the Baby caused chaos, spilling a bowl of goldfish onto everyone's laps. After the mess was cleaned up, Jane had to mend her dress torn the day before. While she sewed, Robert expressed his frustration with the Sand-fairy, suggesting they leave it alone and play forts instead. Despite the mishaps and the need for Jane to mend her dress, the children stuck together, agreeing to let go of the Sand-fairy's wishes and enjoy their time playing together in the chalk-pit.|"['1.

Cyril and the others discussed the importance of making a sensible wish to the magical creature, the Psammead. They reflected on their previous wishes for boundless wealth and beauty, realizing the impracticality of those desires. They decided that wishing for fifty pounds in two-shilling pieces would be a more reasonable choice. Excited by the possibilities, they prepared to visit the Psammead at the gravel-pit to make their new wish. Martha insisted on the Baby joining them, believing the fresh air would benefit him. The children, including the Baby, set off with high hopes, planning to wish for the money and then go to town to buy things they needed. However, as they approached the gravel-pit, a sudden realization struck them - they had forgotten to mark the Psammead's location, causing them to pause in uncertainty.|"['1.

The children had to take a break, not because they were tired, but because the baby Lamb insisted on being put down. They couldn't focus on finding a lost knife in the sand with an active baby to watch. The Lamb was full of energy from the fresh air and playfully threw sand at Anthea. When sand got in his eyes, he cried. To soothe him, Robert opened a bottle of ginger-beer, but it spilled, causing more chaos. The Sand-fairy warned about being careful with wishes, citing a story of a boy who wished to be dead and caused a scare. The Psammead added that being dead is like sleep and one wakes up somewhere. The children realized their mistake and regretted their actions.|"['1.

At the gate, the group stopped to move the Lamb from Cyril's back to Robert's. Suddenly, a fancy carriage appeared with a lady in elegant attire. She held a fluffy white dog and beckoned Cyril over, introducing herself as Lady Chittenden. She insisted on holding the Lamb, but the children grew uneasy. As the lady's coachman and footman quarreled, the children seized the opportunity to escape into a nearby wood, hiding among the trees until the commotion subsided. The lady eventually left, and the children felt relieved. They had narrowly avoided a strange encounter with the lady and her chaotic entourage.|"['1.

Cyril expressed concern about the situation, realizing that many people were interested in the Baby. He suggested they head home quickly to ensure the child's safety. Along the way, they encountered various individuals who showed interest in the Baby, but the siblings were cautious. They faced challenges from a boy offering to carry the Baby, a girl crying for him, and even gypsies claiming the child as their own. Despite the tense situation, Cyril remained calm and proposed a plan to the gypsies to allow the Baby to get accustomed to them before making a decision.

"""That's fair enough,"" said the man holding the Baby, trying to loosen the red neckerchief the Lamb had pulled tight around his throat. The gipsies whispered while Cyril said, ""Sunset! we'll get away then."" Robert asked about dinner, but the others scorned his concern. The gipsy-woman offered food, and the Lamb enjoyed bread soaked in water with sugar. The children kept the Lamb happy as the gipsies watched. By supper, the children were glad to eat boiled rabbit and a bird dish. The Lamb grew fond of the gipsies, showing off his manners.

The children were surrounded by friendly faces, eager to play with the loyal Lamb. But the Lamb clung tightly to Jane, letting out a sad roar. Anthea hurriedly explained the Lamb's routines, but the gipsies were initially upset. Suddenly, a change came over them, and they became calm. The sun had set, but everyone hesitated to move. The gipsy woman, touched by the Lamb's kindness, blessed him for bravery, love, work, and safe travels. She spoke in a mysterious language, and Cyril noted that the wish hadn't affected them. The moral of the story is about being kind and loving even when feeling upset. The next day, the children stayed indoors due to the rain, writing letters to their mother.

Have you ever woken up early on a summer morning? It's a beautiful sight with the pink and yellow sunlight, dew-diamonds on the grass, and shadows moving differently than in the evening. To wake up early, try a trick. Before bed, lie flat, say the time you want to wake up, push your chin down, and then whack your head back on the pillow. Repeat for each hour. Anthea, in the story, woke up at five by hearing the clock strike eleven. She washed her face, dressed neatly, and sneaked out the window to carry out her secret plan. She preferred handling it alone. She met the Psammead, a cross creature, and asked not to be granted any wishes until after breakfast.|"['1.

Anthea explained the wonderful opportunity they had been given to make wishes, cautioning against frivolous desires. The Psammead shared a cautionary tale about a boy who wished for wings that turned to stone at sunset, leading to a disastrous fall. It highlighted the importance of practical wishes in the past compared to lofty, unattainable desires now. The Psammead emphasized the impossibility of turning abstract wishes like beauty or popularity into stone. The children were then granted beautiful, colorful wings by the Sand-fairy, feeling a mix of lightness and heaviness. The Psammead warned them to be mindful of their newfound wings and bid them farewell before taking a nap. Anthea's tardiness for breakfast led to a mischievous act by Robert, diverting Martha's attention so they could sneak away to the sand-pit.|"['1.

"Anthea curiously asked, ""Does it hurt?"" but received no response as Robert spread his wings and soared into the air. He appeared awkward in his knickerbocker suit, especially with his oversized boots dangling. The rest of the children followed suit, rising gracefully with their wings outstretched. Flying felt familiar, like a dream everyone has experienced but struggles to recall. The sensation of soaring high above the ground, gazing down at the world below, was described as akin to viewing a living, moving map. The children marveled at the magic of flight, gliding effortlessly over landscapes, feeling the rush of air against their faces. As hunger struck, they indulged in ripe plums from an orchard, only to be interrupted by the orchard owner. Startled, he witnessed the children's rainbow wings and received payment for the plums they had enjoyed.

He rose slowly and entered the house, treating his wife kindly that day, making her feel happy. She adorned herself with a blue ribbon, looking lovely, which made him even kinder. Perhaps the winged children did one good deed that day. Wings can get you into trouble but also out of it. They faced a fierce dog when seeking food, but their wings scared it away. Unable to find help, they decided to take food from a clergyman's larder. With little money, they left a note explaining their hunger and the need to survive.

Stealing is wrong, but in this story, the children felt it was a fair trade for survival. Hungry and unaware of the true value of the food taken, they saw it as a necessary business transaction. Led by Cyril, they snuck food from a larder window, believing they needed it to live. They reasoned that certain items were essential, like the soda-water syphon, to prevent diseases. On top of a tower, they had a makeshift picnic, struggling with paper plates and a faulty knife. Drinking from the syphon was a messy surprise.

The children had a hearty dinner, drank all they could, and basked in the sun, making them drowsy. Anthea, Jane, Cyril, and Robert soon dozed off under their warm wings. As the sun set, the shadows grew longer, enveloping the churchyard. They awoke in the twilight, feeling the chill. The siblings found themselves atop a church tower, far from home, with little money and a soda-water syphon. Discovering a turret door, they hesitated but decided to risk taking the syphon. Cyril concealed it, and they prepared to shout for help. With a plan in place, they counted down and let out loud cries to attract attention from the clergyman's house nearby.|"['1.

Cyril explained that after making a wish to be in a besieged castle, everything turned upside down. The room they were in was very real, with thick stone walls and beams for a ceiling. They found themselves in a courtyard with Martha and the cook moving strangely. The Lamb was suspended in mid-air, laughing. Feeling helpless, they entered a dim room with wooden tables. Cyril theorized that their servants couldn't notice the castle as it was in the same place as their house. The children worried about not being able to see or feel their dinner in the invisible castle. Jane felt like she hadn't eaten in years due to the strange situation.|"['1.

The castle they explored filled them with hope, but it lacked food and soldiers. They watched the invisible servants in the courtyard, unsure of where to find the dining room. Martha carried an invisible tray, serving unseen food. Disheartened, they sat at the table. Cyril's bread appeared real when he bit into it, inspiring the others to do the same with invisible food. Despite the odd taste, they felt encouraged. They finished their invisible meal, preparing for the impending attack. Climbing a tower, they saw the besieging party's tents beyond the moat, unsettling them. Cyril speculated on the castle's history, and Anthea mentioned the defensive holes in the gate-tower.|"['1.

The kids discovered many unusual weapons in the castle. They found swords, lances, crossbows, and daggers, but they were too heavy for them to use effectively. Cyril suggested hurling them like javelins or dropping them on enemies' heads. They even planned to use stones from the courtyard as weapons. They pretended to be defending a besieged castle, eating biscuits and drinking water from horns. The children watched the besiegers from afar, seeing them move like ants.

""Get Levi and remove those photos. Clear the tent. Put up a curtain or something,"" the man continued. ""It's a shame we don't have tights in his size! But we'll get them before the week is over.

The tent flap lifted, and a couple entered, causing a girl to shriek. Bill chuckled, knowing it was a trick. Robert, the center of attention, struggled to keep a straight face.

A boy named Cyril hurried to a sand-pit early one morning to meet a creature called the Psammead. He asked the Psammead if it was feeling better after an incident involving tears. The Psammead, in a good mood, asked Cyril if he had a secret wish. Cyril, hesitant at first, finally revealed his desire to the Psammead. The Psammead encouraged Cyril to ask for something grand, like a Megatherium. Cyril's siblings were unaware of his early morning visit to the Psammead. Cyril's interaction with the Psammead sparked thoughts about the extraordinary events that had taken place recently, including his brother Robert's wish to be bigger than the baker's boy.

Cyril was eager to have wishes granted instantly, without the need to disturb the Psammead repeatedly. The Psammead warned them about wishing for things they might not truly desire, referencing their previous wish for a castle. Despite this, Cyril convinced the others to hold off on making more wishes until they were certain. They decided to head to the woods for nuts and sat under a chestnut tree. The Lamb accidentally broke Cyril's watch, leading to chaos. As they all wished for the Lamb to grow up, the Psammead transformed him into a grown man.

The Lamb, now grown-up, dismissed his siblings rudely, instructing them to go home. He claimed he would visit later, but the children were not welcome. To avoid being seen with them, he damaged his bicycle to avoid taking them along. The children, feeling rejected, tried to persuade him to spend time with them in the woods.

The lady approached, and the kids strained to eavesdrop, but couldn't make out her words. The Lamb, now known as St. Maur, chatted with her, impressing everyone with his mature demeanor. Earlier, he had been a mischievous toddler, but now he fixed the lady's bicycle and even showed off a gold watch. Anthea intervened, reminding the lady of the Lamb's true nature. The lady, startled, quickly rode off, leaving the children exposed. They explained their brother's predicament, but the lady mistook them for lunatics.

As the sun began to set, the children reached the White House. The older kids wished to wait until the sun had completely set to see their grown-up brother Lamb turn back into their baby brother. However, Lamb, in his adult form, insisted on moving forward and was met by Martha in the front garden. The Psammead had ensured that the household servants wouldn't notice any changes caused by the children's wishes. Martha saw the usual scene, while the children still saw Lamb as an adult.

Cyril and his siblings were discussing the power of wishes when Martha interrupted with news of a burglary at Peasemarsh Place. Lady Chittenden's jewels were stolen, leaving her in distress. The children felt sorry for her but also wondered why she had so many jewels when their own mother only had a few precious items. They realized that Lady Chittenden's trust in riches had not served her well. Worried about the consequences of their own wish to find the Psammead, they considered the possibility of being sent to a madhouse if they shared the truth about their magical encounters. Cyril warned Jane not to tell their mother, fearing she wouldn't believe their unbelievable story.|"['1.

As soon as dinner was over, the children's mother returned home and was warmly embraced by her eight children. They struggled to keep a secret about the Psammead from her, as they usually shared everything with her. However, they managed to hold back. Mother had stories to share as well, about Granny, her pigeons, and Auntie Emma's donkey. She admired the flowery-bowery atmosphere of the house, making everything feel natural and pleasant. Mother was surprised to find a beautiful ring with diamonds and pearls, along with valuable jewelry scattered around the room. The children grew uneasy, especially when they suspected the jewelry might be stolen. Martha, the maid, revealed her plan to leave due to her engagement to a gamekeeper named Beale. Anthea pleaded with her mother not to involve the police, insisting that Beale was honest and kind.|"[""1.

It was a dreadful situation. An innocent man was wrongly accused of theft due to Jane's wish. Despite wanting to tell the truth, everyone hesitated, fearing the consequences. The children were left in charge by a decisive woman who entrusted them with guarding precious jewels hidden in her room. They admired her leadership skills, imagining how helpful she would be in tricky situations they often found themselves in.
