The grassy area behind the cottage was a vibrant green, shimmering with morning dew. Smooth and well-kept by a garden roller and a goat's nibbling, it was a lively spot. The goat's kid, full of energy, loved to dance and frolic around. One day, an Italian boy arrived playing a pipe and drum, with dancing dolls on a board. The kid, hearing the music, leaped and danced joyfully. Little Mary, enchanted by the spectacle, admired the kid's playful moves. As the Italian boy left, the goat and kid continued to dance to the fading sounds of the music. In another tale, young birds learning to fly faced mishaps when overcrowded in nests. A hedge-sparrow nest incident with haymakers in a field led to chirping and fluttering, causing two chicks to tumble out, one landing in the hedge. The mother bird guided one chick back, while the other chirped sadly below, yearning for its nest.|"['1. What is described as a lively spot behind the cottage?\nA. The goat\nB. The Italian boy\nC.

Once upon a time, a helpless baby bird found itself in a frightening situation. Some boys, unaware of the bird's fear, tried to catch it as it fluttered and hopped from branch to branch along a hedge. The boys' intentions were not harmful, but they unknowingly injured the bird's feet in their pursuit. Just when things seemed dire for the little bird, along came Charles Turner and his sister Fanny. They saw the commotion and approached with kindness. They gently examined the bird and discovered its injured feet. Fanny, moved to tears, suggested taking the bird home to care for it.

"Once, the family returned home with a bird wrapped in a white handkerchief. They realized they had no cage for the bird. Charles sought advice from the coachman, Timothy, who offered an old wire lantern. They found a chaffinch's nest in a pear-tree to place the bird in. Mrs. Dowse, the cook, brought bread and milk for the bird. Fanny learned to feed the bird with a quill full of food. They named the bird ""Chirp"" and took care of it every day. Meanwhile, Fanny's uncle gifted her a beautiful canary named Dicky. Dicky lived in a large brass wire cage with perches, a seed-box, a bower of groundsel and chickweed, a mirror, a drinking glass, and a bath. Dicky had a daily routine of bathing, breakfasting, grooming, singing, and admiring himself in the mirror."|['1.

When the sun shone brightly, a gentleman-like canary bird was always perched in a mulberry-tree. His melodious singing echoed joyfully amidst the green leaves. Feeling sorry for a lonely little lame sparrow near the stable, Fanny and Charles placed the sparrow next to the canary's cage. The sparrow gazed in admiration at the canary, listening intently to his songs, chirping for more. This arrangement continued daily for a week. The canary seemed to pity the sparrow. Eventually, Fanny and Charles decided to place the sparrow in the canary's cage. Initially, the canary was protective of his food and perch, but over time, they became friends. The sparrow, though still lame, grew strong and presentable, resembling a loyal servant next to the lively canary. They lived happily together, much to the delight of Fanny and Charles.|"['Question 1:\nWhat kind of bird was always perched in the mulberry-tree when the sun shone brightly?\nA) Sparrow\nB) Robin\nC) Canary\nD) Blue Jay\nE) Pigeon', ""Question 2:\nHow did the sparrow feel when placed near the canary's cage?\nA) Sad\nB) Annoyed\nC) Indifferent\nD) Admiring\nE) Angry"", 'Question 3:\nHow did the canary initially react when the sparrow was placed in his cage?\nA) Protective\nB) Aggressive\nC) Indifferent\nD) Friendly\nE) Curious', ""Question 4:\nWhat happened to the sparrow over time in the canary's cage?\nA) It became aggressive\nB) It remained lame\nC) It grew strong\nD) It flew away\nE) It stopped singing"", 'Question 5:\nHow did Fanny and Charles feel about the relationship between the canary and the sparrow?\nA) Indifferent\nB) Disappointed\nC) Delighted\nD) Annoyed\nE) Sad', 'Question 6:\nWhat did the sparrow resemble after living with the canary for some time?\nA) A wild bird\nB) A lonely bird\nC) A loyal servant\nD) A noisy bird\nE) A sick bird']"|['C) Canary', 'D) Admiring', 'A) Protective', 'C) It grew strong', 'C) Delighted', 'C) A loyal servant']
Mary rushed into her bath with a splash and hurriedly dressed. The window was a delight as the sunlight melted the frost, creating sparkles like stars on fairies' foreheads. The view transformed into ponds, then lakes, and the angels and fairies seemed to dance away. Downstairs, the cozy parlor greeted her with warmth from the fire, Bouncer on the rug, and breakfast ready. Outside, trees were adorned with frost, resembling silver and diamonds. Mary's family joined her, admiring the magical scene. Mary counted the days until Christmas Eve, a special day celebrated at their cottage.
