In the winter, we gather around the fire for games like Blind-man's Buff. Watching the children play in the snow on New Year's Day is delightful. They run, jump, and throw snowballs with joy. Katie prepares snowballs for Gus, while Edith overcomes her fear of the cold to join in the fun. Nelly's little lamb, a motherless gift, stays close to her. The postman brings exciting letters, and a game of blowing dandelion seeds is proposed. The atmosphere is filled with happiness and laughter as the children enjoy the snowy day.|"[""1.

Naughty cat, licking your paws, have you eaten little Dick? That would be unkind! No, I see Pretty Dick has flown away, singing happily on a tree branch. I too would feel wrong if a giant locked me up just for singing. Yet, I did put my little pet in a cage, so he must be glad to be free. Through the corn, children gather bright red poppies, not waiting for the harvest. Poppies wither quickly in the heat, enjoying a short but sweet life. In our boat, we glide on the blue water, watching ripples sparkle in the sun, lilies float near reeds, dragonflies and swallows dart around. This scene around our boat is delightful. The seed sown months ago now yields grain, a sign of God's care bringing seasons round. His blessings fill our fields, providing all we need. Let's try our luck with apples and onions on a string, a fun game for Ethel, Kate, and their brothers. In autumn, corn is cut, but we enjoy plums, nuts, pears, and apples. Laden trees show God's love, providing pleasant fruits for us. The beech tree's shade is a play spot for George, Anne, and Mary, where George carves their names. Rain cancels our walk, leading to an indoor concert with drums, singing, and music-making. Everyone must follow Tom's beat for a grand concert on this rainy October|['1.
