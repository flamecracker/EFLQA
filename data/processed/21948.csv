Although we wrote a book filled with stories about amazing six-legged creatures, our main hope was to give all children a great time. We wanted mothers and teachers to find the book useful and enjoyable for the kids. We worked hard to include only creatures that any child could see daily. We hoped the stories would be interesting enough for kids to want to write about them and learn from them. One of us wrote the stories while the other drew and labeled each sketch clearly. We wanted children to have fun outdoors, climbing, canoeing, picnicking, and swimming. We also wanted them to appreciate the marvels of insect life, their joys, and struggles, and how they fit into the creation's plan. We encouraged kids to think about and be kind to these little creatures.|"['1.

Insects have their bodies divided into parts. Behind the head is the thorax, meaning chest, followed by the abdomen. These creatures all have six jointed legs. Some insects are helpful, while others cause trouble. Insects are always hungry, feeding on leaves, twigs, sap, and roots. Bugs with sucking beaks bore into plants, pump sap, and can cause harm in large numbers. For instance, aphids and scale insects can be troublesome pests. Ladybugs can help control pests like the cottony-cushion scale. Baby beetles, called grubs, eat a lot to grow into adult beetles. They eat roots before emerging as beetles.|['1.

Caterpillars thrive on specific plants, like carrots or milkweed, until they grow large. They then spin a cocoon or rest in a leaf. In the town of Bemis, excitement stirs as Betty, Jimmie, and Mrs. Reece arrive. Ben Gile returns to guide the children. The lodge bustles with preparations, while Betty and Jimmie play joyfully outside. An old man climbs up the street, his white hair and beard blowing in the wind. He explains how tiny muscles and nerves control a butterfly's body, similar to humans. The brain quickly responds to pain signals, just like butterflies. The butterfly's brain is tiny, located above a food tube, with nerves running through the body. This intricate system helps the butterfly function.|"['1.

"""Children, handling insects gently is important to avoid causing them pain. Instead of squeezing them, catch them in a net made of bobinet with a rounded bottom attached to a wire ring and a suitable handle. There are two humane ways to euthanize insects, but they are not safe for children. One method involves placing a few drops of chloroform on cotton under an upside-down tumbler, where the insect will peacefully fall asleep. The other method uses a cyanide bottle, which should be tightly sealed and never opened. A hand lens can magnify the intricate details of an insect, revealing tiny hairs, rings, feelers, facets of the eyes, and more. Ben Gile demonstrated how to prepare a box with cork lining, steam dry insects, and pin them carefully for observation. Despite his eccentric appearance, Ben Gile's expertise in entomology fascinated the children, although it frightened little Betty momentarily."""|"['1.

In the woods, Betty met Ben Gile, a unique old man who had a maple sugar camp. He was a teacher in winter, made maple sugar in spring, and spent summer days guiding or watching wildlife. The oddest thing was his connection to animals. There was a tale about a trout he tamed that followed him until it tragically drowned. Ben shared stories, like one about a boy who ate a caterpillar but never a grasshopper. He then narrated a tale about an old man with an insect army. He described how locusts make sounds by rubbing their wings, and he showed Betty the anatomy of a locust. Ben's stories captivated Betty, making her wonder about his past.|"['1.

"Ben Gile excitedly tossed the locust in the air, urging it to fly away with a loud ""Shoo!"" The sound attracted a variety of animals - two baby deer, an old cow, a mother cat with her kittens, a big black dog, and even a group of squirrels. The children around Ben Gile's cabin were busy catching insects with nets and boxes. They all gathered inside the cabin, amazed by the walls lined with books in different languages and cases filled with beautiful specimens of butterflies, moths, birds, and more. The cabin also had telescopes, magnifying glasses, and even musical instruments like a flute.

Mrs. Cricket has a long spear at the end of her body. She uses it to bore holes and carefully place her eggs inside. Look at this mole cricket that Peter found. Mole crickets live underground, leaving tiny tracks and eating plant roots. They don't need eyes but have thick forelegs for digging. Now, release your crickets in the fields gently. Later, we'll catch a katydid. The children set tables with trout, biscuits, maple syrup, berries, and cookies under the trees. Katydid males sing love songs about what Katy did and didn't do. They make music by rubbing their wings. Katydid's bright green color helps them blend with leaves to avoid birds. They eat whenever and are informal, making them a tasty meal for birds if they're not careful.|"[""1.

"Dragonflies are fascinating creatures that have captured the curiosity of scientists and storytellers alike. Often seen darting about over pools, these slender insects with gauzy wings are not only harmless but also beneficial to humans. They voraciously consume flies, mosquitoes, beetles, spiders, and centipedes, making them valuable allies in controlling insect populations. 

Dragonflies lay their eggs in water or on the stems of water plants, with some species even submerging themselves to lay their eggs. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which undergo multiple molts before emerging as adult dragonflies. The transformation from a creepy-looking nymph to a graceful, glistening dragonfly is a marvel of nature. 

So, next time you see a dragonfly flitting about, remember the incredible journey it took to become the elegant flyer it is today."|['1.

Insects have fascinating adaptations to survive. Antennae are used by insects for various functions like touch, smell, and hearing. Ants greet each other by touching antennae and identify friends or foes by scent. Male mosquitoes have hairy antennae that vibrate when Mrs. Mosquito sings. The butterfly's proboscis is a coiled tube for sipping nectar from flowers. Mrs. Mosquito has a biting mouth, while Mr. Mosquito feeds on nectar. The locust has biting jaws for nibbling on grass. Air-pores in insects are protected by fine hairs like our nostril hairs. Children excitedly prepare for a camping trip by a river, equipped with fishing rods, cameras, and more. Lace-Wing, a delicate insect, transforms from a larva to a graceful adult with gauzy wings and golden eyes, part of the same family as the ant-lion and caddis-fly.|"['1.

The guide explained to the group about a peculiar insect called an aphis-lion, known for its cruelty towards plant-lice. These tiny creatures feed on the plant-lice by piercing them with their sharp claws and sucking their blood. The aphis-lions are also fond of eggs, especially those of other insects. The guide shared a fascinating fact about Mamma Lace-Wing, who carefully lays her eggs on stems attached to leaves or twigs to protect them. When the eggs hatch, the young aphis-lions search for food. Eventually, they spin cocoons, transforming into lace-wings. The guide then switched the topic to ant-lions, explaining how they trap ants in sand pits to devour them. The ant-lions lie in wait, using their sharp jaws to catch unsuspecting prey. These creatures eventually transform into adult ant-lions with wings. The group enjoyed a riverside lunch, with the sound of chopping wood and sizzling bacon filling the air.|"[""1.

The elderly man explained to Peter about the caddis-worm, a tiny creature that builds its own home using materials like sand and silk. He marveled at the worm's patience and ability to construct different types of houses, from horn-shaped structures to cozy cottages with silk hangings. The man compared the caddis-worm's behavior to that of human beings, pointing out how they carry their homes with them as they swim or walk. He also mentioned a young caddis-worm that sets up a web to catch insects for dinner, much like fishing. The man then announced a competition for the children to learn about ants, with a magnifying glass, a book, and a prize of five dollars as rewards.

Flies are fascinating insects with unique abilities. Unlike beetles or grasshoppers that can bite with their heavy jaws, flies have fine, sharp-pointed jaws that pierce the skin to draw blood. These acrobatic creatures can crawl up walls and walk upside down effortlessly due to their specialized foot structure. However, flies are not welcome in homes because their feet collect dirt from unsanitary places. When flies land on surfaces, they may transfer this dirt. Additionally, flies lay eggs in unclean areas, which hatch into maggots that grow rapidly. Despite their nuisance, some flies like Mrs. Tachina-Fly play a beneficial role by laying eggs on young caterpillars, helping control harmful caterpillar populations. So, it's important to keep flies out of our living spaces to maintain cleanliness and hygiene.|['1.

"If I had to choose between Mr. and Mrs. Mosquito, I should take Mr. Mosquito, for he neither bites nor buzzes, but attends strictly to his own business. Perhaps he thinks Mrs. Mosquito's voice pretty. Perhaps he likes to hear about her adventures. But most people do not, for they think Mrs. Mosquito a busybody, always going where she is not wished, always breaking up conversations, and always coming back after she has been plainly told that she is not wanted. Yet her singing is music in the ears of her husband. Perhaps if we had long, slender antennae, all covered with hairs, like his, we, too, might like her song. When she sings these hairs begin to tremble, to vibrate, and a little nerve in the antennae changes this trembling to sound.

In every way, Mr. Mosquito seems a more pleasant body. He eats very little and contents himself with nectar. But she, knowing that excitement makes the blood flow faster and being a hearty eater, begins her song gently at first, then louder and louder, nearer and nearer. Finally, with her long, slender, sharp stylets, she makes a hole in your cheek or your arm, pushes in her sucking-beak, and pumps up the blood. And there she sucks and sucks until her stomach is full or she is brushed off or killed.

Two English doctors set out to uncover the truth about a disease in Italy. They built a secure house in a mosquito-infested area but remained healthy by keeping mosquitoes out. The illness was thought to be spread by night air, but the doctors disproved this theory by staying well. They discovered that mosquitoes spread malaria by biting someone sick and then someone healthy. To study yellow fever, Dr. Walter Reed and his team conducted experiments in Havana. They proved that mosquitoes, not contaminated clothes, spread the disease. By allowing infected mosquitoes to bite them, the team fell ill, demonstrating the mosquito's role in transmitting the disease. Their brave efforts helped save countless lives and contributed to eradicating mosquitoes in the Panama Canal zone.|['1.

"The long-awaited day finally arrived after an entire summer of anticipation. Hope, Betty, Jack, Peter, Jimmy, Mrs. Reece, and Ben Gile gathered at the pond's edge with their packs ready in the canoes, paddles in hand. The food and tents had been taken ahead by other guides the day before. Amid farewells from friends, they set off on their adventure. Excitement filled the air as everyone chattered at once, eager for the journey ahead. Hope and Betty, new to camping, were in for a treat as the boys planned to show them the wonders of outdoor living. They encountered a ""carry,"" a path between lakes where packs and canoes had to be transported. The girls and Mrs. Reece made multiple trips carrying the gear, while the boys and the guide skillfully balanced the canoes on their shoulders to swiftly cross over.

Peter was curious about the difference between moths and butterflies, although he was more interested in reaching the mountain top than studying insects. He explained to Jack that moths and butterflies have long jaws with grooves that form a slender tube called a proboscis. This tube uncoils to sip nectar from flowers. Peter pointed out that the dust on Jack's fingers was actually tiny hair and scales from the wings of these insects. He described how the scales contain pigment grains that create the brilliant colors on the wings, similar to the colors on a soap bubble. The guide emphasized the intricate design of even the smallest parts of a butterfly's wing, showing the purpose behind every detail. Ben Gile reassured that these insects, like Isabella the caterpillar, are harmless and prefer tender plants over biting humans.|"['1.

Every living being goes through changes as they grow, just like a boy transforms into a man. The butterfly lays an egg, from which a tiny worm emerges. This worm then spins a cocoon and transforms into a moth or butterfly. It's a remarkable cycle of transformation. While children don't change their skins like moths, the mystery of life is just as intriguing for all creatures. Ben Gile, patient and wise, explains how caterpillars and moths share similarities in their bodies and legs. Caterpillars eat voraciously to support their growth, shedding their skin to accommodate their expanding bodies. The group reaches a campsite on a mountain, surrounded by nature's beauty. As dusk falls, deer visit the pond nearby. They gather around a campfire for a hearty supper of stewed apricots, bacon, and hot cakes.

The mother butterfly is quite carefree about her children being seen as bothersome because they voraciously consume any greenery they fancy, even before being invited to. Gardeners and farmers breathe a sigh of relief when the caterpillars finally settle down to pupate. They transform in various ways; some burrow into the ground, while others craft silky cocoons from their hairs and silk. The monarch butterfly sheds its skin to form a hard casing. On the other hand, the clothes moth lays eggs on wool, birthing larvae that munch on the fibers before cocooning themselves. Certain caterpillars, like leaf-rollers, fashion leafy hammocks for their pupation. These creatures, nurtured by humans, devour mulberry leaves voraciously for 45 days before spinning their cocoons. The silk thread produced is unwound and used for various purposes.|['1.

In front of the cabin, Ben Gile, Mrs. Reece, and the guides anxiously watched the night sky. Lightning flashed vividly as black clouds approached. Distant rumbling turned into a nearby ominous sound. Mrs. Reece felt uneasy, not wanting the children alone in the tents. Betty and Hope soon arrived at the cabin, surprised to see everyone awake. The boys followed, pretending not to care about the storm. As they waited for the storm to hit, torrents of rain and wind descended. Ben Gile suggested a fire in the fireplace to ease the tension.

You can observe diving-beetles in action by a brook, rowing with their hind legs and surfacing for air. These beetles are voracious, feeding on insects and even daring to nip at fish. Whirligig-beetles, on the other hand, are lively and shiny, with bubbles on their tails allowing them to breathe underwater. Their unique eyes help them navigate above and below the water surface. Burying-beetles lay eggs on dead animals, providing food for their young. Weevils bore into chestnuts to lay eggs, leading to fat worms inside. Blister-beetles, with oozing oil, can cause blisters and have a cunning strategy of infiltrating bees' nests for food.

In the woods, Ben Gile led the children quietly, teaching them about the wonders of nature. They learned about beetles like the ambrosia-beetles that eat fungus and the engraver-beetles that tunnel under tree bark. The children were amazed by the beauty of the early morning woods, sparkling with raindrops. Ben Gile showed them signs of partridges and taught them to respect nature by only taking what they needed for food. They saw partridges take flight and heard the sound of the shot-gun as they were hunted. The group managed to catch eight partridges, which was enough for everyone. Ben Gile also pointed out signs of a bear in the area, showing the children the importance of respecting wildlife.|['1.

Have you ever observed a bee up close? Their bodies are covered in tiny plumes of hair, unlike other insects. Bees have specialized mouths for various tasks. They possess strong biting jaws and another pair of jaws connected to the lower lip, creating a sucking instrument used for drinking nectar. Antennae on their heads act like elbows, aiding in smelling and feeling. Bees with short tongues often live alone, while those with long tongues typically form colonies. It seems that the length of a bee's tongue influences its sociability. For instance, Andrena, a fascinating short-tongued bee, lives alone in a house she digs underground. She creates a nourishing paste from nectar and pollen, which she packs into shiny, porcelain-like rooms she constructs. After laying an egg on each food pile, she seals them away behind a door for safety.|"[""1.

The elderly man explained that unlike ants and wasps, bees do not feed their young insects. Some bees live in clustered apartments with a common entrance and separate hallways. Each bee has a specific role like carpentry, masonry, mining, or tailoring. For instance, the leaf-cutter bee meticulously constructs its home using rose leaves. It creates rooms with pollen paste, eggs, and leaf roofs. The mother bee waits for the eggs to hatch and cleans the nest once the babies mature. However, there are lazy guest-bees that rely on their hosts for food and cleanliness. Unlike the diligent bumblebee, guest-bees do not collect pollen. Despite being untidy, Mrs. Bumblebee is content with her nest, believing the honey-bees could be less fussy. The bee family consists of a queen, drones, and workers.|['1.

In the world of bees, Mrs. Bumblebee is a masterful creator. She repurposes old cocoons left by worker bees into cozy rooms for new baby bees, destined to be drones and queens. As the summer days wane and the chill of autumn sets in, the colony faces a somber fate. Only the young queens survive, finding refuge in warm crevices for a winter slumber. When spring arrives, the queens emerge, ready to establish new hives for their future families. In the realm of honey-bees, workers diligently care for the larvae, feeding them bee jelly until they mature into full-fledged bees. The birth of a queen is a special event, marked by the careful construction of a larger chamber and exclusive feeding habits. Eventually, the new queen emerges, ready to lead her hive into the world.|"['1.

Mrs. Honey-Bee, the current queen of the hive, is upset about the arrival of a new queen. The workers protect the new queen from Mrs. Honey-Bee's jealousy. The hive is too crowded for new babies, so the workers raised a new queen to start a new family. When there isn't enough room for both queens, the old queen leaves with part of the family to find a new home. The workers are responsible for bringing in all the pollen and honey for the hive. Bees collect pollen in baskets on their legs and carry it back to the hive. They turn nectar into honey by evaporating the water in the honey sac through wing movements. Bees also make wax for the hive by consuming honey and secreting wax plates.|"[""1.

During the summer, diligent workers gather food to sustain a large family in the cold season. If food runs low, these workers resort to stinging the babies to prevent them from starving. Due to their immense responsibilities, these workers have short lifespans, typically living only six to eight weeks compared to the queen bee who may live up to three years. Jimmie was amazed by the bees' intelligence and inquired about wasps, recognizing their cleverness too. As the children prepared to leave Camp-in-the-Clouds after a week of outdoor adventures, they felt a sense of melancholy knowing their summer fun was coming to an end. Despite enjoying city life and school, their happiest times were spent in Rangeley Village during the summer, eagerly anticipating the return of good times with friends and adventures in the upcoming year.|['1.

Ben Gile, leaving the cooking to other guides, gathered the children and Mrs. Reece. He shared a tale about a nest high in a tree, belonging to Mrs. Vespa-Wasp. The nest, not like a human house, blended beautifully with the sky. Constructed of wasp-paper made from wood-pulp, the nest was a round, Japanese lantern-like structure. Mrs. Vespa-Wasp and her family collect wood-pulp by scraping weathered wood from trees. They use this material to build multiple stories within the nest, like floors in a human house. Mrs. Vespa-Wasp lays eggs in the nest's rooms and gathers food for her young wasps. The nest expands as more rooms are added, with new floors built underneath to support the growing family. The wasps continually renovate their home, ensuring its safety despite the ongoing construction.|['1.

In the warm season, as the wasp family grows large, some upper cells are removed to create a cozy attic for shelter from wind and rain. The wasps dislike cold and wet conditions. Curious about their home, I carefully examined the structure, uncovering soft, white baby wasps in many rooms. When fully grown, these babies become hornets, known for their stings. I observed as the warm air coaxed out stiff worker wasps, assisting them outside. To feed the young, I prepared a sweet syrup as they eagerly consumed it. Unlike adult wasps, who feed on honey and nectar, the babies rely on insects provided by their mothers. Mrs. Polistes, a cousin of Mrs. Vespa, lives in a simpler house suspended from a porch or eaves. Some wasps, like bees, prefer solitary living and exhibit remarkable skills in building nests. For instance, the thread-waisted sand-digger wasp in California constructs intricate homes in salt-marshes, showcasing its unique abilities.|['1.

Have you ever seen a large cicada making a loud sound in the trees? Some wasps enjoy these insects as food. When the cicada sings, Mrs. Wasp attacks it, stings it, and then carries it back to her home for her young ones to eat. The evening party at Ben Gile's cabin marked the end of a beautiful summer, as Betty and Jimmie were leaving for the city the next day. This evening would determine who would win the prize. Betty had worked hard and wanted to win, while Jimmie didn't see the point. Peter giggled at the mention of ants, showing little interest. Hope and Betty spent time observing ants, fascinated by their activities. Jack was eager to win the prize, hoping to explore the world of insects with a magnifying glass and a book. He believed he would make unique discoveries. Betty shared her observations about ants, marveling at their teamwork and organization within the colony.

The queen ant is not a real ruler but the mother ant, laying all the eggs. Workers care for and protect her. They are active, digging passageways, clearing paths, and storing food. Some ants build deep tunnels underground with mounds around entrances. Others make homes in logs or stems. One ant builds a shed from decayed wood to protect aphids that secrete honeydew. Lazy ants go to war to steal eggs and babies, making them slaves. Respectable ants have a well-regulated household. Winged ants fly on a wedding journey, hunted by birds. Males die, while queens lose wings.|['1.

Ants are fascinating creatures that work together in colonies to build and maintain their homes. The queen ant carefully lays her eggs, which hatch into legless larvae. She feeds them tender insects she chews herself. The larvae may transform into queens, males, or worker ants. The first set of workers are tiny and busy from morning till night. They forage for food, clean the house, and repair any damage. These workers also care for the larvae, moving them to warmer, drier spots when needed. Some ants have soldier ants with big heads and strong jaws to protect the colony. Workers have small heads with sensitive antennae they use to communicate. Ants are truly remarkable creatures that work together for the good of their colony.|['**1.

Ants are fascinating creatures with unique behaviors. For instance, there are honey-jar ants that store honey in their crops and feed their family members until their abdomens are as big as currants. Another type of ant lives in the home of larger ants, carefully making doorways too small for the big ants to enter and eat their babies. These little ants stroke the big ants to make them produce sweet drops to feed on. Thief ants even steal food from other ants' homes. Mother aphids lay eggs near corn roots, and ants move the babies to other roots for food. Harvester ants build mounds and store seeds in galleries, creating clear pathways. Despite their small size, ants exhibit impressive behaviors like building roads, tunnels, and farms of aphids.|"['1.
