On a frigid Saint Valentine's eve in Kentucky, a light dusting of snow covered Lloydsborough Valley, revealing the tracks of rabbits scurrying home to escape the cold. The wintry stillness was interrupted only by the occasional ice-cutter's wagon. Icicles hung from the depot's eaves, and the wind hurried past, causing even the telegraph wires to shiver. Inside, two boys arrived at the depot, cheeks rosy from skating, their skates in hand. Bursting through the door, they made their presence known. The ticket agent, recognizing them as the Maclntyre boys, remarked on their lively nature. The station-master, fond of boys, noted their family's extensive travels and good manners. He mused about little Ginger, the granddaughter of Mrs. Maclntyre, who had arrived from the West and was sure to bring excitement to the winter ahead.|"[""1.

While the boys chatted by the ticket booth, two youngsters lounged on a bench near the stove, feeling drowsy from their outdoor play. Keith, the younger lad, yawned and lay down with his cap as a pillow, looking much younger than his eight years.

"""Of course,"" he complained, ""a little gentleman like you don't understand what it's like to travel from town to town and have every door closed in your face. You might not think this world is cold and selfish because you've been given the best of everything. But imagine if you had only scraps and leftovers from others your whole life, no home, friends, or money, and on top of that, you were sick. Wouldn't you feel like things were unfairly split?

The man shifted uncomfortably, feeling hungry and desperate. He didn't want to be recognized at the station due to a distinctive scar on his face. Persuading the boys to lead him to a cabin, he flattered them into thinking they were doing the right thing. As they walked, the man seemed suspicious, and the cold made Jonesy shiver. Keith, noticing this, selflessly gave his coat to Jonesy, surprising the man. They reached the cabin, where a fire was lit, and preparations for a bed were made.

"Old Johann Heinrich, a retired German naturalist, lived a solitary life in Lloydsborough Valley. Despite being called ""queer"" by his neighbors, he had a deep love for birds and insects, authoring two books about them. One cold night, as he read late, a fire broke out in a nearby cabin where a child named Jonesy was trapped. Without hesitation, the elderly professor rushed to the rescue.

A frightening memory haunted the man, of waking up to choking smoke and urgent shouts from his boss. In a panic, he stumbled through the thick smoke, desperately seeking an escape. Finally, he leaped out a window, inadvertently fueling the flames. Jonesy, a young boy in the cabin, suffered burns as he tried to flee the fire. The professor intervened, insisting on caring for Jonesy himself. Despite protests, the professor took charge of treating the burns, refusing to rest until the boy was safe. Meanwhile, Unc' Henry, a watchman, discovered footprints leading away from the cabin, hinting at a mysterious visitor.

"Malcolm and Keith heard the term ""a child of the slums"" but didn't fully grasp its meaning. It made them see poor Jonesy as different, unclean, and someone they shouldn't associate with.

Mrs. MacIntyre planned to send him to an orphan asylum, but Miss Allison felt Jonesy's bond with the old professor, who entertained him with stories and music, was special. Mrs. MacIntyre suggested the boys visit Jonesy with the bear, but hesitated due to his background. Jonesy, who came from the rough Chicago slums, traveled with a tramp and a bear to earn food.

Christmas! I doubt if he ever heard the word. His speech is something shocking; nothing but the slang of the streets, and so ungrammatical that I could scarcely understand him at times. No, I am very sure that neither Sydney nor Elise would want the boys to be with him. They took the bear with them, which Jonesy welcomed like a lost friend. They spent an interesting hour among the professor's collections, listening to his explanations in his funny broken English. Then they explored his cottage, much amused by his queer housekeeping, cracked nuts on the hearth, and roasted apples on a string in front of the fire. Jonesy expressed his sorrow about being separated from his friend Barney, feeling lost without him. Despite promises of help, Jonesy feared being sent to an asylum, longing to be reunited with Barney.
