"**The Brave Heart of Scotland**

William Wallace and Robert Bruce were two remarkable figures in Scottish history who played pivotal roles in securing Scotland's independence from English rule. Despite being initially dismissed as legends akin to St. George or King Arthur, meticulous research has validated the heroic deeds attributed to them by contemporary historians. Wallace, in particular, was unfairly maligned by English chroniclers as a ruthless outlaw, a depiction refuted by modern scholars like Mr. W. Burns. The village of Glen Cairn, nestled in a scenic valley west of the Pentland Hills, was once home to Glen Cairn Castle. Following the tragic demise of Sir William Forbes and the Kerrs' hostile takeover, Dame Forbes and her son Archie struggled to maintain their modest estate. Despite the Kerrs' dominance, the villagers remained loyal to the Forbeses, recognizing Archie as their rightful leader. Dame Forbes, wary of the Kerrs' treachery, kept a low profile, focusing on educating Archie and providing for their meager household."|"[""1.

Archie was often seen playing games with the village boys, who considered him their leader. Despite this, his mother repeatedly reminded him to treat everyone as equals and not show any superiority. She held high hopes that Archie would avenge his father's death and reclaim their lands. Archie spent much of his time training with Sandy Grahame in the use of weapons. His mother, though quiet, instilled in him the ambition to follow in his father's brave footsteps. Archie's determination to win back his inheritance was fueled by stories of his father's valor. As he practiced with Sandy, starting with a wooden sword and progressing to a blunted one, Archie grew stronger. At fifteen, he gave Sandy a challenge. One day, while playing with the other boys, Archie spotted Sir John Kerr and his son Allan approaching with armed men. Despite the interruption, Archie's father advised him not to engage with them needlessly. Archie's father promised to explain the complex situation of the Scottish throne the next day. He revealed the history of King Alexander's children, the 'Maid of Norway,' and the succession crisis that followed her death. King Edward's proposal for his son to marry the 'Maid of Norway' was discussed, along with the treaty that outlined the terms of the marriage and the protection of Scotland's rights and liberties.|"[""1.

In the past, King Edward acknowledged Scotland's independence without claiming any authority over it. The treaty ensured Scotland's rights and laws remained intact. However, Edward cleverly added a clause preserving English rights. When the Maid of Norway passed away, the competition for the Scottish crown intensified. Edward seized the opportunity to assert his authority by appointing a Lieutenant of Scotland. The Scottish lords did not resist initially. Edward then summoned the northern barons to Norham for arbitration on the Scottish crown. Many Scottish nobles had close ties to England through marriages and lands, making them vassals to England. The meeting at Norham revealed Edward's claim to supremacy, which most Scottish nobles disputed. Eventually, John Baliol was declared King of Scotland, leading to unrest and resistance among some Scots like Sir Malcolm Wallace, who refused to acknowledge Edward's authority and paid the ultimate price.|"[""1.

Archie, an eighteen-year-old lad of great stature and strength, was insulted by an English boy while walking through the streets. This led to a scuffle between Archie and his friends against English soldiers, resulting in a few English soldiers being slain before they made their escape. Archie's mother, acknowledging his potential, hoped he would avoid English retribution and one day fight for Scotland's freedom. Archie, deeply affected by the conversation, vowed to prioritize Scotland's liberation over personal matters. He formed a group called the Scottish Avengers, training them in combat techniques and instilling a sense of patriotism. Despite the risks involved, Archie kept his activities secret, even from his mother. One day, while engaged in a mock battle with his friends, they were interrupted by Red Roy, a retainer of Sir John Kerr, but managed to convince him they were playing a game.|"['1.

News traveled slowly to Glen Cairn. Updates only arrived when a traveling merchant or a villager journeyed to Lanark or Glasgow with goods for market. Baliol realized his monarchy was just a title. A dispute with King Edward arose over court decisions. Edward demanded all Scottish court judgments be appealed in Westminster, going against the Treaty of Brigham. Baliol resisted, but Edward claimed the right to judge Scottish cases. Baliol was forced to annul the Treaty and all similar agreements. Edward's conflict with the French king escalated, leading to a call for Baliol's support. The Scots held a parliament, dismissed English officials, and formed an alliance with France. Edward prepared to invade Scotland, starting with Berwick's brutal siege, resulting in a massacre. The Scots faced overwhelming odds against the English forces.|"['1.

The English army moved northward with King Edward, and the Earl of Dunbar's wife surrendered the castle to the Scots. The Earl of Surrey besieged the castle with a strong army. The Scottish nobles and people gathered to lift the siege but were defeated by Surrey's well-trained force. Over 10,000 Scots were killed in the battle. Edward's army grew with Welsh and Irish reinforcements. They marched through Scotland, capturing towns and castles. Baliol was forced to abdicate in favor of Edward and was sent as a prisoner to London. Scotland was now under English control, with garrisons in every stronghold. The Stone of Scone was taken to Westminster, symbolizing Scottish submission. The people of Glen Cairn were shocked by the news, and a sense of betrayal lingered among them. The story of William Wallace, a Scottish rebel, also reached Glen Cairn, inspiring hope for future resistance against English rule.|"[""1.

In fear of being caught after a daring escapade, Wallace decided to leave his uncle and settle in Lag Lane Wood. There, he lived with his friends, embarking on wild adventures like hunting and exploring the countryside. Once, in disguise in Ayr, Wallace overheard English soldiers boasting about their strength. One soldier claimed he could withstand any blow from a Scotsman. Wallace offered three groats for a strike, and with one powerful blow, he killed the soldier. This led to a skirmish with the English, resulting in Wallace being captured. Despite falling ill in prison, he was saved by a caring nurse. Wallace's reputation grew as he engaged in conflicts with the English, gathering more supporters.

Earl Percy learned that Wallace had led a fair fight against a sword player challenging him, so he didn't see Wallace as breaking the truce.

Archie started early the next morning, carrying a wallet with a new suit his mother had struggled to provide. He proudly wore a sword, a symbol of manhood in those times. As he approached Lanark's gates, he encountered Sir John Kerr and his men. Archie, boldly introducing himself as a gentleman and son of a knight, faced their scrutiny.

A loud cheer erupted from Wallace's supporters, echoing his vow to capture Lanark that night. The sound of a bugle filled the air, resonating through the woods. After a meal, they descended the path with torches. Near the town, they encountered fifteen men. Wallace shared the news and plan, then they marched west. Archie felt the thrill of the adventure as they approached the town. Wallace devised a plan using a tree as a battering ram. They silently crossed the moat, broke the drawbridge chains, and entered Lanark. The Scots shouted for justice against Hazelrig. The townspeople, angered by Marion Bradfute's murder, joined the fight. Wallace confronted Hazelrig, leading his men to victory.|"[""1.

In Lanark, Wallace led the townspeople to overthrow the English garrison. The citizens, with Wallace's help, fought fiercely, and many English soldiers fell. The town erupted in celebration, but the victory came with consequences. The burghers knew King Edward would seek revenge. Wallace and the council strategized to defend the town, gather troops, and raise funds for the war. Wallace sent proclamations across Scotland, rallying support for their cause. Amidst the planning, Marion's body was laid to rest, and Wallace called for a gathering at Cart Lane Craigs. Despite doubts from his uncle, Archie was determined to stand by Wallace's side. His uncle supported him, offering supplies and funds for the cause. The stage was set for a challenging yet determined fight for Scotland's freedom.|"['1.

Archie wisely brought a guard to protect him from the Kerrs' party approaching the hold. He quickly built a barricade with his men to defend the gate. As the Kerrs arrived, they were surprised by the barricade and armed men. Sandy Graham advised Archie to leave immediately to avoid confrontation. Archie arranged for carts to transport his mother and belongings. After securing the carts, he visited his old friends to share his plans. Once everything was ready, they set off towards Lanark without any interruptions. Archie then returned to the craigs and met his band of young lads, explaining their mission to serve as messengers and protect Sir William Wallace. Archie stressed the importance of discretion, bravery, and readiness to sacrifice for Scotland's cause.

Sir William was surprised by Archie's suggestion to enlist young lads as messengers and scouts. Initially hesitant, Sir William eventually agreed, understanding their potential value. Archie assured Sir William that the boys, sons of his father's vassals, were faithful and trustworthy. Sir William emphasized the seriousness of the task, highlighting the risks involved. He made it clear that the boys, under Archie's charge, would be treated as full-fledged members of the band. Archie then led the boys to a secluded spot near the stream, where they set up camp.

Archie's instructions were clear - always have someone ready to deliver a message, keep a sentry in camp, and be prepared for any task. The lieutenants trained the group regularly, ensuring they were comfortable with their weapons. Each morning, two went to collect food, while four kept watch for enemies. News of Wallace's call to arms spread, attracting more Scots to join him. The English were taken aback and King Edward prepared to invade again. Wallace's army, led by him, Boyd, and Auchinleck, faced the Earl of Kent's troops. Wallace's strategy was to prevent looting until after the battle. With additional horsemen from Annandale and Eskdale, the Scots charged the English, causing chaos and securing victory. Wallace's men celebrated with a feast and safely stored the spoils.|"[""1.

In the morning, the English advanced towards Wallace's army, hoping to catch them off guard. Led by the Earl of Lancaster, they had gained reinforcements and passed the battleground from the previous day. Wallace initially moved forward but then retreated, realizing the English's strength. The English charged recklessly onto a boggy area, not realizing the danger. Their horses got stuck, and the Scots, dismounted and strategically positioned, attacked them. The Earl of Westmoreland and many others were killed. Wallace's forces grew after the victory at Biggar, and he was acknowledged as the leader of the Scottish forces. A truce was proposed by the English leaders due to King Edward's absence. Wallace remained vigilant, preparing for future conflicts. Despite attending a council at Ayr, he preferred the safety of the woods. Archie, his loyal messenger, grew anxious about potential treachery at the upcoming council.|"[""1.

Jock was perplexed by the unfamiliar words he overheard. Although the governor had been facing the door while speaking, Jock couldn't grasp the meaning behind the conversation. The officer's mention of holding several Scots intrigued him, urging him to seek more information. Jock decided to return to Archie directly, rather than sending a message, as he sensed the significance of the officer's words and the governor's response. Meanwhile, Cluny, having sold his produce at the governor's house the day before, aimed to eavesdrop during the banquet for the garrison officers.

A muffled noise reached Cluny's ears, but he couldn't make out the words. Plates clattered and glasses clinked in the background. After nearly two hours, silence fell over the gathering. Cluny sensed the banquet was over. He strained to hear the voices inside, hoping for crucial information. Despite the temptation to eavesdrop, he remained still, knowing any noise could endanger him and Wallace. A voice rose in anger, warning of consequences for disobedience. Another voice, defiant, rejected treachery. Cluny, having overheard enough, focused on escaping undetected. He noticed a window wide enough for him to slip through. Climbing out, he found himself in a lane by the governor's house. Unable to leave town that night, he hid until the streets emptied.

Cluny, a timid lad, found himself in a predicament after selling eggs to the governor's cook. He was left stranded outside the gates after they closed. A rough soldier tried to harm him, but some burghers came to his rescue. Cluny, worried about his torn clothes, sought refuge in a kind burgher's kitchen.

Around nine o'clock, the man left behind, along with ten others who joined after Wallace had started, caught up. Each man, following Wallace's orders, grabbed a big bundle of straw from the stack. The group, now eighty strong, headed towards the barn. Wallace planned for Grahame, Archie, and half the group to rush to seize the gate of Ayr. They pretended to be part of the barn guard. As they neared, they saw the wooden building brightly lit with English soldiers outside, some drinking wine sent from inside. The Scots quietly approached. Wallace's team handed their straw to Grahame's men. With a sudden shout, they attacked the English soldiers. Grahame's group rushed to the barn door, lit the straw on fire, and quickly fled towards the town. The English soldiers, caught off guard, were swiftly defeated. The Scots set fire to the barn, where the English perpetrators of the Ayr massacre were trapped and perished. Meanwhile, Grahame and his team reached the gate of Ayr. They tricked the guards, entered the town, and liberated the citizens to fight for freedom. The Scots took revenge for the Ayr massacre, sparing only a few.

Archie was furious. The Kerrs had destroyed the cottages at Glen Cairn not because the sons joined Wallace's army, but because they were loyal to the Forbeses. Archie vowed to help rebuild the cottages and seek vengeance. He planned to attack the Kerrs' castle, Aberfilly, with his small band using fire and harassment. Wallace cautioned against it, as it could alienate other nobles. Still, he promised support if needed. Undeterred, Archie set out with his band towards Aberfilly. They stopped at a Kerr farm, and Archie approached the crofter's house with four of his men.|"[""Question 1: Why was Archie furious in the text passage?\nA) Because Wallace cautioned him against attacking the Kerrs' castle\nB) Because the Kerrs destroyed the cottages at Glen Cairn\nC) Because the crofter's house was empty\nD) Because the Kerrs joined Wallace's army\nE) Because the Forbeses were loyal to the Kerrs"", ""Question 2: What did Archie vow to do after the Kerrs destroyed the cottages at Glen Cairn?\nA) Join Wallace's army\nB) Seek vengeance and help rebuild the cottages\nC) Abandon his band and seek refuge\nD) Negotiate peace with the Kerrs\nE) Leave Glen Cairn for good"", ""Question 3: Why did Wallace caution Archie against attacking the Kerrs' castle, Aberfilly?\nA) He feared Archie's band was too weak\nB) He believed the Kerrs were innocent\nC) He thought it would alienate other nobles\nD) He wanted to protect the Kerrs\nE) He didn't trust Archie"", ""Question 4: What did Archie plan to use to attack the Kerrs' castle, Aberfilly?\nA) Swords and shields\nB) Fire and harassment\nC) Diplomacy and negotiation\nD) Magic spells\nE) Poisoned arrows"", ""Question 5: How did Wallace react to Archie's plan to attack Aberfilly?\nA) He joined Archie's band immediately\nB) He warned Archie against it but promised support if needed\nC) He betrayed Archie to the Kerrs\nD) He abandoned Archie and his band\nE) He went to warn the Kerrs about the attack"", 'Question 6: Where did Archie and his band stop before heading towards Aberfilly?\nA) A castle\nB) A market\nC) A Kerr farm\nD) A church\nE) A river']"|['B) Because the Kerrs destroyed the cottages at Glen Cairn', 'B) Seek vengeance and help rebuild the cottages', 'C) He thought it would alienate other nobles', 'B) Fire and harassment', 'B) He warned Archie against it but promised support if needed', 'C) A Kerr farm']
Archie spoke quietly, instructing the crofter to convey a message of defiance to Sir John Kerr, vowing to avenge the cruelties inflicted on Glen Cairn. The crofter hesitated, but Archie's threat to burn his house if he refused made him reluctantly agree. Sir John Kerr, upon hearing the message, was enraged and nearly ordered the crofter's hanging. His advisors persuaded him against it, warning of the consequences. Despite the knight's fury, he decided to send men to hunt down Archie but found no trace. That night, a fire broke out at several homesteads, causing chaos. As Sir John Kerr rushed out, the drawbridge collapsed, plunging him and his men into the moat.|"['1.

Archie and his group had planned a daring attack on Sir John Kerr's castle. They successfully cut the beams of the drawbridge, causing it to collapse when Kerr and his men crossed it. The chaos that followed allowed Archie and his companions to ambush the men-at-arms with arrows, causing casualties. Despite the retaliation from the castle walls, Archie's group managed to escape. Enraged, Sir John Kerr mobilized his vassals to hunt down Archie's band. The vassals scoured the hills, but Archie's knowledge of the land kept them hidden. Frustrated by the attacks on his estate, Sir John intensified his search efforts, only to face more losses and ambushes. Red Roy suggested a hidden cave where Archie's group might be hiding, hinting at a possible refuge for the elusive foes.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat was the result of cutting the beams of the drawbridge at Sir John Kerr's castle?\nA) The castle walls collapsed.\nB) The men-at-arms were ambushed.\nC) Sir John Kerr and his men were trapped inside.\nD) Archie's group faced retaliation.\nE) The vassals were mobilized."", ""Question 2:\nHow did Archie's group manage to escape despite the retaliation from the castle walls?\nA) They surrendered to Sir John Kerr.\nB) They hid in the hills.\nC) They attacked the vassals.\nD) They destroyed the castle.\nE) They sought refuge in a cave."", ""Question 3:\nWhy did Sir John Kerr mobilize his vassals to hunt down Archie's band?\nA) To negotiate a truce with Archie.\nB) To invite them for a feast.\nC) To seek revenge for the ambush.\nD) To offer them a reward.\nE) To join forces with them."", ""Question 4:\nWhat did Red Roy suggest as a possible refuge for Archie's group?\nA) A hidden cave\nB) The castle walls\nC) The hills\nD) The drawbridge\nE) Sir John Kerr's estate"", ""Question 5:\nHow did Archie's knowledge of the land help his group evade Sir John Kerr's vassals?\nA) By leading them into a trap.\nB) By hiding in the castle.\nC) By surrendering to the vassals.\nD) By seeking refuge in the hills.\nE) By staying hidden."", ""Question 6:\nWhat was the outcome of Sir John Kerr's intensified search efforts for Archie's group?\nA) He captured Archie.\nB) He faced more losses and ambushes.\nC) He negotiated a truce with Archie.\nD) He destroyed the hidden cave.\nE) He joined forces with Archie.""]"|['B) The men-at-arms were ambushed.', 'B) They hid in the hills.', 'C) To seek revenge for the ambush.', 'A) A hidden cave', 'E) By staying hidden.', 'B) He faced more losses and ambushes.']
"The knight announced, ""We will search tomorrow. Inform the vassals to gather three hours before daybreak. We aim to reach after sunrise. If the foes are on foot tonight, they will be asleep.

Archie observed from above as the attackers retreated out of bow range. One of them sped down the hill while the others settled down, indicating a delay in their next move. Archie, with most of his group, returned to the cave after some searchers reported back. They found a narrow passage ascending rapidly, ending in a hole with daylight visible. Archie decided to enlarge the hole cautiously to avoid detection. He instructed four members to work on it while being mindful of not disturbing the surroundings. The plan was to block the passage in case of a fire outside the cave. Sir John Kerr and his men prepared for a possible attack, ready with swords and bundles of faggots.

Archie and his band were trapped in a cave, but they were working hard to widen the entrance for fresh air to come in. They knew the Kerrs would try to break in, but Archie was determined to hold them off. After hours of digging, they were close to breaking through. As the sun set, Archie finally pushed aside the last bit of earth and heather, creating an exit. They escaped unnoticed and set fire to the Kerrs' homesteads to distract them. The Kerrs were furious when they discovered the damage. This event sparked a rebellion against the English, with more Scots joining Wallace's cause. Wallace hoped for the support of nobles like Comyn or Bruce to strengthen their movement and unite Scotland against Edward.|"['1.

Wallace preferred Bruce over Comyn due to Bruce's youth, strength, and potential to unite Scotland against English rule. Despite facing challenges and being outnumbered by England, Wallace believed their resistance would inspire a national movement for Scottish independence. Wallace's forces were camped near Lanark, the movement's center. Archie, a member of Wallace's group, received permission to visit his uncle before embarking on a new mission. The group set out towards Turnberry Castle to capture Bruce, who was fighting for England against Douglas. Archie planned to seize Bruce peacefully and bring him to Lanark.

Sir William Douglas and Bruce were in their country, and it seemed best to allow them to win the day without interference. However, there were concerns that there might not even be a battle. Reports indicated messengers were shuttling between Percy's army and the Scots, suggesting a potential peace agreement with the hesitant barons. Unfortunately, the news that followed was grim. Most nobles, including Wishart, Douglas, and Bruce, except Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, submitted to their guilt of rebellion. Percy guaranteed their safety and possessions, but Sir William Douglas, unable to fulfill his promises, surrendered and was imprisoned until his death. The surrender of the leaders did little to change the situation, as the people had already achieved victories without their help. The movement led by Wallace grew stronger, spreading across Scotland, with skirmishes occurring in various regions. Despite the treaty of Irvine, peace was not assured, and the people's confidence in Wallace increased. The English were weak outside fortresses, and only in Berwick and Roxburgh did they hold power. Many Scottish nobles were at Edward's court, but their vassals supported Wallace. During this time, Sir Robert Cunninghame, a neutral Scottish knight, invited others to discuss calming the disorder.

As Sir John spoke, Archie swiftly ran across the street and positioned himself next to Wallace, raising his hand high. Jock Farrell, who had been loitering nearby, dashed off down the street upon seeing the commotion. Wallace and Archie fought off two attackers, with Archie injuring a third. They began to retreat down the street, but the noise attracted more soldiers who joined the fray. William Orr and his group of young men entered the fight, forcing the English soldiers to momentarily retreat. The allies formed a line of defense with pikes, pushing back the English soldiers. Andrew Macpherson's surprise attack at the gate momentarily overpowered the guard before they regrouped. Wallace faced Sir John Kerr in a fierce battle, defeating him. The group broke through the English soldiers at the gate and retreated to safety. Despite the English horsemen pursuing them, the group managed to gain a lead and escape across the stream. Wallace then declared the lands of Sir John Kerr forfeit and awarded them to Archie Forbes. Sir John Grahame was tasked with seizing the Kerrs' hold with five hundred men the next day.|['1.

Archie, your new lands come with uncertainty. If Scotland prevails, the king will honor your grant. If England wins, your land is forfeit. Congratulations on reclaiming your father's lands. Beware the powerful Kerrs, but your deeds will outweigh their influence. Prepare your vassals for battle and fortify your castles. Kerr's stronghold may resist siege better than Glen Cairn. Archie's arrival at Glen Cairn sparked joy and enthusiasm. He chose to fortify Aberfilly Castle to withstand attacks. Archie's vassals pledged unwavering support. Sir John Grahame secured Aberfilly, and the Kerrs' vassals embraced the change. Archie was warmly welcomed and promised fair treatment.|"[""1.

Archie stood proudly beside Wallace on the high ground north of the Forth, overlooking the English army preparing to cross the river. Wallace had entrusted Archie to fortify Aberfilly, a castle strategically located on an island at the confluence of Linlithgow, Edinburgh, and Lanark counties. The castle needed strengthening to withstand potential sieges by the English forces seeking to reclaim it for Sir Allan Kerr. Archie, with the aid of his vassals and skilled masons, embarked on extensive renovations to fortify Aberfilly. The moat was widened and deepened, walls raised, towers added, and defenses bolstered. As Archie rode to join Wallace near Stirling, he left Aberfilly secure and well-defended, ready for any assault. The Scots, though outnumbered and facing a formidable English army, were determined to defend their homeland against the invading forces led by Earl of Surrey.|['1.

After the English men-at-arms defeated the Scots, they faced a sudden turn of events. The troops left to guard the bridge were overpowered, leading to the loss of the royal and Surrey's banners. The Scots took control of the bridge, forcing the men-at-arms to charge back in a futile attempt to reclaim it. The Scots fiercely resisted, using pikes and arrows. Sir Marmaduke de Twenge, along with his nephew and a squire, managed to escape. Wallace and his men joined the attack on the English and Welsh forces, leading to a decisive victory for the Scots. The English, demoralized by the loss, fled in fear. The Scots pursued and inflicted heavy casualties. The Earl of Surrey entrusted the Castle of Stirling to Sir Marmaduke de Twenge before leaving. The English supplies fell into Scottish hands, and Cressingham was among those killed.

Wallace and his colleague organized the country's military, creating districts with appointed commanders and lieutenants. They negotiated to protect traders with the Hanse towns. Nobles opposing Wallace faced consequences like land confiscation, granted to loyal gentlemen. Wallace acted in the name of Baliol as king, held captive in England. While Scotland briefly enjoyed peace, Earl Percy retaliated to Scottish raids. The English prepared to invade, gathering a formidable force at York. The Scottish nobles hesitated to join, fearing backlash from their countrymen. Wallace defeated English forces in Fife. The English army retreated due to lack of provisions, unable to engage the Scots. Edward's massive army faced challenges near Edinburgh, delayed by Scottish tactics. The English learned of Wallace's imminent attack and prepared for battle near Linlithgow.

The armies were arranged in formations for battle. The Scottish infantry formed squares with spears pointing outwards, protected by archers under Sir John Stewart. The English army, divided into three groups, faced them. The first two divisions were knights and men-at-arms, while the third consisted of archers and slingers. Wallace's strategy was for the Scottish squares to withstand the enemy's attack until the Scottish cavalry could strike. The English divisions tried to surround the Scots, causing chaos. The English cavalry eventually broke through, leading to a fierce battle. The Scots, led by Wallace, fought bravely but were overwhelmed by English archers and cavalry.

After the battle of Falkirk, Wallace split his forces into smaller groups, disrupting the English army's supply lines. This forced the English to retreat to the Forth for provisions. Wallace then regrouped and attacked the English at Linlithgow, causing heavy losses. Despite his successes, Wallace decided to resign as Scotland's guardian due to the lack of support from Scottish nobles. He believed that only a united Scotland could resist England. Wallace's followers were saddened but understood his decision. Wallace continued to fight the English in France. Meanwhile, Edward sent Baliol to Rome and faced resistance in Scotland.

In the following spring, Edward led a large army into Scotland, joined by Scottish nobles loyal to the English crown. They besieged Carlaverock Castle, defended by only sixty men, but it held out against the massive army until it was finally captured. The Scots retreated, employing tactics of scorched earth. Edward faced challenges and, under the pretense of heeding pleas from the Pope and the King of France, returned to England without significant progress. The next summer, Edward returned with a fleet, but the Scots thwarted his advances, forcing another retreat. Battles ensued, with the Scots defeating the English cavalry in multiple conflicts.

During the English invasion of Scotland, towns and farmlands were destroyed, including the rich abbeys of Abberbredok and Dunfermline. Archie Forbes, a noble who had remained mostly in his castle, joined the resistance when needed. Despite Comyn's reluctance to recognize Wallace's grants, Archie's loyalty to Wallace was strong. Archie, a robust young man in his early twenties, had been secretly building a tunnel from his castle towards a nearby wood. When the English army approached, Archie gathered his people in the castle, sending women and children to safety. Refusing to surrender, Archie held his castle against the English. Wallace's return prompted Archie to join him in resisting Edward's forces, engaging in guerrilla warfare to disrupt the English advance.

Stirling Castle, a stronghold during the Scottish Wars of Independence, withstood a siege by Edward's army for seventy days in 1304. The English army used various war engines and even stripped lead from churches for projectiles. Despite the relentless attacks, the garrison held out until their provisions ran low, surrendering with only a few survivors. Sir William Wallace, a Scottish hero, kept fighting in the field while the castle was under siege. Sadly, he was later betrayed by Sir John Menteith, captured, and executed in a brutal manner by the English. Wallace's legacy as a valiant leader who fought for Scottish independence remains unparalleled in history. His military tactics influenced future battles, showing the effectiveness of infantry against cavalry. Edward's cruel treatment of Wallace and other Scots tarnished his reputation despite his military successes.|"[""1.

After the conquest, Edward appointed commissioners to govern Scotland. Among them was Robert Bruce, who now held titles after his father's death. Although subdued, the Scots still held onto hope and resistance. Archie, feeling the weight of the situation, decided to leave for France to seek help. Disguised as a lowland farmer, he traveled to London to meet with Robert the Bruce. Archie believed that only Bruce could lead Scotland to freedom.

Archie Forbes, a loyal supporter of Bruce, quickly prepared his forces to march to Glasgow, the designated meeting point. Messages from Bruce indicated growing support. As Bruce traveled, he was joined by Sir James Douglas, an influential nobleman, whose father had died in English captivity. Douglas's allegiance bolstered Bruce's cause. Upon reaching Glasgow, the English garrison fled, allowing Bruce to declare Scotland's independence. Bishops of St. Andrews and Glasgow, along with other nobles, pledged their support. Bruce moved to Scone, where he was crowned King of Scotland on March 27, 1306. Isobel of Buchan, despite her ties to the Comyn faction, played a crucial role in the coronation.

When the news of the events at Dumfries and the uprising in southern Scotland reached Edward in Winchester, he was furious. Scotland, which he thought defeated, had risen again. Aylmer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, was sent to Scotland to quell the rebellion. Edward sought the Pope's help, but Scottish clergy refused to obey orders to excommunicate Bruce. Edward, unable to lead due to age, prepared a grand ceremony in London. The Earl of Pembroke, Clifford, and Percy marched into Scotland.

During a council meeting, Edward issued a decree commanding all citizens to search for and deliver those who had been in armed conflict or committed crimes. Negligence would result in the loss of castles and imprisonment. Pembroke, the guardian, was tasked with punishing those who sheltered offenders. Harboring or aiding the slayers of Comyn would lead to severe consequences. Archie, having free time, enjoyed fishing, a skill learned in Glen Cairn. He explored the sea with locals, but trade with the Irish mainland was limited due to the rugged coast and wild inhabitants. Rathlin's people were self-sufficient, relying on sheep for wool and the sea for food. Archie found solace in watching the fierce waves crash against the rocks during stormy weather.

The prior greeted Archie and mentioned their conversation about Bruce. Archie confirmed he was at Dumfries when Bruce killed Comyn, but it was not premeditated. The prior praised Archie's loyalty to Scotland and Wallace. Archie defended Bruce's actions and recounted his journey to London to persuade Bruce to fight for Scotland. The prior, impressed by Archie's account, promised prayers for Bruce's success. After a stormy stay, Archie departed Colonsay with calm seas and a farewell from the monks. Archie reflected on the contrast between the calm sailing and the stormy journey to Colonsay.

"""I hope so, indeed,"" Bruce replied; ""for it were an evil day for me and for Scotland that saw you fall; but henceforth I will fret no more concerning you. You alone of Wallace's early companions have survived. You got free from Dunstaffnage by some miracle which you have never fully explained to me, and now it would seem that even the sea refuses to swallow you."" ""I trust,"" Archie said more gravely, ""that the old saying is not true in my case, and that hanging is not to be my fate. Assuredly it will be if I ever fall into the hands of Edward, and I shall think it a cruel fate indeed if fortune, which has spared me so often in battle, leads me to that cruel end at last.""

The fisherman assured Archie that he would be landed in a remote place where he wouldn't encounter any English. He described the castle of Dunluce nearby but emphasized the need to remain hidden. He suggested that his son Ronald, a capable companion, accompany Archie as a retainer during his stay in Ireland. The fisherman explained the unique landscape with columns resembling tree trunks and the Giant's Causeway. Duncan skillfully navigated the boat to the Causeway, where Archie and Ronald disembarked. They found a niche among the rocky formations to wait for dawn. Archie marveled at the strange columns, speculating that they were the work of powerful enchanters.

Ronald pointed to the rising ground ahead, mentioning hidden recesses untouched by the tide. As they ascended slowly, their eyes adjusting to the darkness, the ground leveled out into a dry floor. Ronald lit a torch, planning to make a fire with driftwood at the high tide mark. Suddenly, they were surrounded by armed figures, ready to strike. The leader, sympathetic to their cause, shared the challenges of resisting English rule. They prepared a meal, sharing stories of resistance and refuge in the hills. After the meal, they settled around the fire, and Archie, understanding the need to wait until nightfall, joined the others in sleep. At night, they journeyed to the mountains of Donegal, seeking an audience with a local chieftain. The simple dwellings and armed reception reflected the harsh reality of living under English rule.|['1.

Insignificant as the hold was, a form of feudal discipline was evident. Two men with pikes stood on the wall, and two leaned against the gate. Archie, an emissary from the King of Scotland, sought to speak with Fergus of Killeen. The elderly man, a white-bearded figure, welcomed Archie and led him inside the house. The room, supported by rows of posts due to a lack of long beams, had bare walls and a clay floor. The chief, a man of about fifty, wore a green tunic with silver adornments. The chief's wife and daughters, clad in similar attire, listened intently as Archie spoke of Scottish efforts for freedom. The chief received a gold chain from the King of Scotland through Archie. The daughters, with their dark hair and expressive faces, showed deep sympathy during the conversation.|"['1.

The Irish chieftain expressed his concerns about the English rule in Ireland and the challenges faced by the Irish people in resisting it. He compared the situation in Ireland to that in Scotland, acknowledging the differences in terrain and the strategies employed by the English. The chieftain, Fergus of Killeen, explained the reluctance of the Irish to rise against England due to the fear of defeat and the devastating consequences it would bring. He highlighted the lack of a unifying leader like Scotland's Bruce and the different attitudes towards prolonged resistance between the two nations. Despite his desire for freedom, Fergus prioritized the well-being of his people and emphasized the need for a united effort across Ireland to stand a chance against English rule. Archie, reflecting on Scotland's struggles, understood Fergus's concerns and the importance of perseverance in the fight for independence.|"['1.

Fergus, the chief of Killeen, warmly welcomed Archie, an emissary from Scotland, to Ireland. Archie was impressed by the primitive life at the chief's hold, where he stayed for three days. The hospitality was lavish, with sheep being roasted daily for all to enjoy. The evenings were filled with harp music and songs of bravery from Ireland's past. As Archie continued his journey south, he found the Irish in Mayo already in arms due to an insurrection against English soldiers. The local chieftains welcomed Archie's mission to unite with the Scots against England. Archie realized that the Irish forces lacked in arms, discipline, and tactics compared to the Scots. He decided to help organize and lead the Irish in a guerrilla war strategy to wear out the English rather than face them head-on in battle.|"[""1.

Archie convinced the chieftains to let him lead a band of two hundred armed men as a reserve. The army grew rapidly as more chiefs arrived with their tribesmen. Hearing of an English force approaching, a council was held where Archie suggested avoiding a direct battle. Instead, he proposed constant skirmishes and attacks to wear out the English. The chieftains disagreed, preferring to face the English head-on. Despite Archie's advice, they prepared for battle. The English, with 800 men-at-arms and 1000 footmen, approached. The Irish, disorganized, charged at the English. The archers and spearmen were swiftly overwhelmed. The English men-at-arms broke through the Irish ranks, causing chaos. Archie, mounted on a horse, tried to rally the Irish but they were no match for the disciplined English force. After several charges, the Irish fled in disarray.|"['1.

The English horse charged at the fleeing group, causing chaos. Some tried to cross the river but drowned. Most headed for the swamp, where many perished. Ronald stuck close to Archie, who dismounted and entered the swamp with a few chiefs. They agreed the uprising was doomed. Archie realized the need for discipline and organization. The chief offered two guides to help Archie escape the encirclement by English troops. At night, they set out through the treacherous swamps, avoiding English patrols. Archie followed his guides carefully, knowing one misstep could lead to disaster. The English had surrounded the area, but Archie and his guides managed to slip through undetected.|['1.

Archie and his guides returned quietly after a quarter of an hour. They continued their journey cautiously, as the English had stationed men to watch for any signs of movement. The guides had to find new paths through the marsh, making progress slow. Eventually, they found firmer ground and avoided English detection. They traveled through the night and rested in a swamp during the day. A local native then guided Archie further on his journey. After ten days of travel, Archie returned to where he had landed, rewarding his guides. He and Ronald took refuge in a cave, signaling Duncan to cross to them. The first attempt was unsuccessful due to bad weather, but the following week, they successfully reunited. Upon their return to Rathlin, Archie reported to the king, revealing the dire news of the capture and mistreatment of Scottish nobles and ladies by the English.

Bruce suggested a swift attack on Carrick, his family's land, to raise his flag in Scotland. The territory had been taken by Edward and given to his nobles. Percy held Carrick, Hereford had Annandale, and Valence occupied Selkirk. Percy was at Turnberry Castle with his men. Bruce sent Cuthbert to check if the Scots were ready to rise, but they were in despair. Cuthbert didn't light the signal fire as planned. Someone else did, prompting Bruce and his men to cross to the mainland. They defeated the garrison near the castle. Bruce's brothers were captured, leading to reprisals. Sir James Douglas vowed to wage war against the English, starting with retaking Castle Douglas. He, with Archie, planned an attack with loyal retainers during a church festival.|"['1.

Dickson and his friends, armed but outnumbered, attacked English forces at a church. Most were slain. Sir James and his men later overtook the church, capturing it and a nearby castle. They looted the castle, killed prisoners, and set it ablaze. Douglas refused to spare lives, citing English atrocities. Bruce, hunted by the English, was betrayed but fought off attackers with a bow and sword. He eluded English troops with a daring escape through a treacherous morass. In a final stand, Bruce defended his followers, slaying many attackers before they fled. His bravery and cunning saved his band from capture.|"['1.

Bruce's followers were inspired by his bravery. Sir James Douglas, his brother Edward, and others returned from their missions, assembling 400 men. Despite their small force, they faced an army led by Pembroke with 800 mountaineers. Bruce divided his party into three, aiming to evade the enemy. Lorne's henchmen pursued Bruce, but he fought bravely, defeating his attackers. The hound led by John of Lorne lost Bruce's scent at a stream, allowing Bruce to escape. Despite continuous pursuit, Bruce's nephew Randolph and others failed to capture him. Bruce's loyal hound inadvertently put him in danger, but his foster brother's sacrifice and Bruce's bravery ensured their escape.

The king, Bruce, was deeply attached to his faithful hound, but the dog's loyalty was a risk. Archie, a loyal friend, knew the hound could lead to Bruce's capture if left with the English. So, he devised a plan to either save the hound or end its life. Archie disguised himself and boldly entered the English camp. Pembroke, the earl, recognized Archie as a former caretaker of the hound. Despite the danger, Archie approached the fierce dog, hoping to calm it. The hound, initially aggressive, recognized Archie's voice and calmed down. The earl decided to entrust the hound to Archie's care, warning him against any escape attempts.

The large dog, Hector, showed immediate recognition upon hearing a familiar voice. His demeanor shifted from bristling to joyous, eagerly leaping and tugging at his chain to greet his friend, Archie. The man accompanying Archie mentioned that Hector's nightly howls had kept the camp awake. The earl decided that Hector should be kept on a chain and share a tent with Archie. As preparations were made, Hector displayed contentment and trust towards Archie. Eventually, orders came for Archie, the earl, and a group of men-at-arms to set out in search of Bruce, a traitor having revealed his location.

Archie warned the Earl not to ride too close, fearing the noise would agitate his horse. The Earl, unsuspecting, followed at a distance. As they trotted, Archie eyed the terrain for an escape route. Suddenly, a Highlander, recognizing Archie, lunged at him with a sword. Before Archie could defend himself, Hector, the hound, leaped at the Highlander's throat. Realizing the Highlander's survival would mean trouble, Archie pretended to struggle with Hector while secretly allowing the hound to attack. The Earl and his knights arrived, and Hector, now calmed, eyed them warily. The Earl demanded an explanation, and Archie concocted a story to justify the hound's actions.

"Archie's belief was proven right. Despite their efforts, Hector refused to continue tracking his master's trail, persistently returning to where the deceased Highlander lay. Pembroke had the body removed, but the hound, fixated on the path it had taken, seemed to forget the trail entirely. Eventually, Pembroke conceded that further pursuit was futile. Disheartened by their lack of success, the group headed back to camp. Pembroke mentioned, ""Our hunt is only delayed. We will surely discover Bruce's hiding spot soon. Next time, we'll muzzle the hound to prevent any interference."" After a brief wait, new information on Bruce surfaced. With Hector muzzled, they picked up Bruce's scent near a remote hut in the hills. The terrain was rough, but they persevered. Archie contemplated putting down the dog but hesitated each time. As they closed in on Bruce, who was ascending a steep hill, Pembroke instructed his men to follow the trail cautiously. They planned to corner Bruce in flatter terrain and continue the pursuit without the hound. When Bruce's pursuers reached the foot of the hill, Pembroke deployed his men strategically. Archie, disregarding orders, freed Hector, who raced after Bruce. As Archie looked back, he saw the knights pausing as he sent boulders crashing down the hillside, stalling their advance."|"[""1.

Pembroke yelled for them to hurry up the hill, warning that the Scot and the hound might escape. As they ascended, three were hit by rocks, slowing them down. Archie dashed away, knowing the armored knights couldn't catch him. He had freed Hector to distract the pursuers, giving the hound a head start. Archie could have kept up with Hector, but the knights couldn't. The hound's baying guided the knights, but eventually faded as Hector outpaced them. After a brief stop, the men removed their armor to chase faster. Archie took a different route from Hector, who had already caught up to the king. Archie then walked to a cottage for the night. The next day, he rejoined the king in Selkirk Forest, where Hector greeted him warmly. The king thanked Archie for saving him from capture and promised gratitude for his loyalty.|"['1.

Lord Clifford reconstructed Douglas Castle, making it larger and stronger, entrusting it to Captain Thirlwall. Douglas led his men to lure out the garrison by pretending to be drovers with cattle. When the Scots attacked, Thirlwall and his men were defeated, and the castle was destroyed. Clifford rebuilt it and placed Sir John Walton in charge. Despite the previous defeat, Douglas tricked the garrison again by disguising his men as countrymen. The garrison followed, only to be ambushed, resulting in Walton's demise. The castle was captured, and its remaining defenders surrendered. Archie Forbes, with sixty men, received a troop from Lady Mary Kerr, who supported the Bruce cause.

Archie, with twenty men, swiftly marched north, avoiding towns and roads, crossing the Firth of Clyde, skirting Loch Fyne, Loch Etive, and Ben Nevis.

Archie Forbes was given a week's holiday, but he knew he had to act swiftly. With his men, he headed south, leaving Marjory behind. They marched through Loudon Hill, Cumnock, and Carrick into Galloway. Archie instructed his men not to harm the innocent villagers, only focusing on capturing English-held castles. He positioned his troops at a river crossing, letting some English soldiers cross before attacking, just like at Stirling Bridge. The ground was rough, strewn with boulders, making it hard for cavalry to charge. Archie divided his men strategically, hiding some near the river. When the English approached, they confidently crossed the ford, aiming to overpower the Scots. But Archie's well-planned defense, with the help of his lieutenants, Andrew Macpherson and William Orr, held off the English attack successfully.|"[""1.

At the signal, two hidden groups quickly stood up and charged towards the ford with their pikes. The English had no defense as their men had already moved ahead to join the battle. The ford was easily captured, and Orr stayed with twenty men to guard it while Macpherson and fifty others attacked the confused English cavalry from behind. The assault was successful; the English were caught off guard and couldn't resist Macpherson's men. Archie's soldiers then charged in, causing chaos among the cavalry. Many were killed or captured, with only a few managing to escape. St. John delivered a message from Lady Marjory about enemy forces marching towards their hold. Archie quickly gathered his followers and headed towards Aberfilly to prepare for the impending threat.|"[""1.

Archie agreed that it was important to always have someone stationed at the entrance to the castle to prevent any surprises. He emphasized the need to be alert and retreat immediately if any footsteps were heard approaching. Archie and his followers proceeded into the castle, where they were welcomed with joy. Marjory, relieved to see Archie back, expressed her anxieties during his absence. Archie praised Marjory's bravery and assured her that they could leave the castle together if needed. Archie then assessed the situation at the walls and discussed the impending threat of the enemy's siege machines. Despite the damage caused by the machines, Archie remained optimistic about defending the castle, especially with the moat as an added obstacle for the attackers. The chapter ended with the continuous bombardment of the castle walls by the enemy's machines, showing the escalating tension and imminent danger faced by Archie and his defenders.|"['1.

The Scots quickly set fire to the English camp, causing chaos among the enemy. Archie's wife, Marjory, took charge of the situation and led a successful sortie against the English machines. The flames engulfed the camp, forcing the English to retreat and leaving the machines destroyed. Archie returned to the castle to find Marjory had taken matters into her own hands, successfully executing the attack. The garrison's spirits were high, and they were ready to fight back against the besiegers. As the situation escalated, Archie sent messengers to seek help from the king. With the breach in the castle wall now open, the besiegers planned a forceful attack, but Archie suspected they had diverted the river to fill the moat.|['1.

As the English approached, a hail of arrows showered down on them. They shielded themselves with shields and large mantlets made of hides and hurdles as they advanced towards the dam. Some men with picks and mattocks began working on the dam, protected by others with shields from the arrow onslaught. Despite casualties from Scottish archers, they persevered. Eventually, a gap was made in the dam, and water helped their efforts. After three hours of labor and fighting, the water level in the moat dropped significantly. A council meeting was held in the castle to decide whether to abandon it or defend the breach. It was agreed to hold the breach, especially since reinforcements might arrive. The next day, knights inspected the moat, planning to fill it with brushwood. The Scots vowed to fight for Scotland, not just for honor, and the English prepared to fill the moat with faggots despite the Scottish resistance.|"['1.

To the surprise of the English, the defenders remained still, hurling stones at their enemy. Suddenly, Archie and his men charged down the breach, driving back the workers. They brought trusses of straw, set them on fire, and the flames spread rapidly. The English camp panicked as the Scots approached. Bruce's small force faced the English, causing chaos. Archie's band entered the English camp, setting it ablaze. The English, attacked from the front and rear, fell into disarray. Archie's men joined the king's force, leading a fierce pursuit that scattered the English. Archie explained the recent events to the king, who arrived just in time to save the castle.

Archie bravely rode towards the castle walls, undeterred by the potential danger of arrows or crossbow bolts. Advising his companions to retreat to safety, he scouted the area. As he approached, the garrison mistook him for a friend until he veered off towards the edge of a deep fissure. Assessing the fortress's defenses, Archie faced a group of English horsemen led by Sir Ingram de Umfraville. In a daring clash, Archie skillfully disarmed Sir Ingram and charged into the English ranks. Despite his valiant efforts, Archie was eventually overwhelmed and captured. Regaining consciousness in the castle keep, he was praised by Sir Ingram for his exceptional bravery in combat.

As they rode within sight of the walls, Cluny and Archie kept a slow pace, eventually reaching a wood. Cluny opened the coffin, revealing a roughly made one with gaps for air. They carried it into the woods, kicked it apart, and scattered the planks. Archie changed into farmer's clothes from a bundle in the cart. He then drove the cart west with the others seated in it. They left the main road for a country track, avoiding the devastated areas. In a hamlet, they arranged for the cart to be returned to Berwick. Continuing over hills, they reached Aberfilly safely. Archie's return brought immense joy to his mother and the tenants, who celebrated enthusiastically. Marjory's courage in defending the castle had won over the people's hearts.

After a victorious battle, Archie advised the king to marry Mistress Mary Kerr instead of Mistress Marjory. The king acknowledged Archie's counsel but insisted that Archie deserved a break after his imprisonment and risked his life. The king planned to handle the English garrisons and traitor nobles before fully engaging with England. During the winter, Galloway was subdued, and Archie enjoyed a peaceful time at home. In the spring, Archie joined the king's army gathering for a march north. The English held several Scottish fortresses, and the Comyns of Badenoch and Buchan were staunch enemies of Bruce. The king's army captured various castles in the north, destroying them to prevent enemy occupation. Bruce fell ill, prompting a move to Slaines Castle for rest, despite the risk of being besieged by the Comyns and English forces.|"['1.

Weeks passed, and the king's health slowly improved. With provisions running low, the Scots decided to sally out, led by the king in a litter surrounded by his knights and footmen armed with pikes. The garrison marched through the enemy lines to safety at Strathbogie, boosting the king's spirits. A subsequent attack by Buchan and his allies spurred the king to action, leading to a victory over the enemy. Bruce then sought vengeance on Comyn's territory, devastating the land. Aberdeen's castle fell, citizens joined Bruce, and English strongholds in Angus were captured. Sir James Douglas reclaimed his castle, while defeating Stewart and Randolph, who later joined Bruce's cause. Randolph became a loyal knight and advisor to the king. Douglas and Randolph joined forces with the king, expanding his control over Scotland.|"[""1.

In medieval Scotland, Galloway rose against the Scots, led by Edward Bruce and Sir Archie Forbes. Despite being outnumbered, the Scots defeated the English knights at the Cree River. Later, Edward and Archie faced Sir John de St. John's larger force. In a daring move, the Scots charged the English, surprising and defeating them three times, with 50 men against 1500. This victory led to capturing 13 castles and defeating more foes. Archie then returned home briefly before rejoining the king to face Alexander and John of Lorne in the mountainous Pass of Brander. Douglas and a group scaled the mountain to flank the enemy, while the main force, led by Bruce and Archie, engaged the Lornes in a fierce battle. Despite challenges, the Scots emerged victorious, showcasing their strategic prowess and bravery.|"['1.

In the meantime, Douglas and his group attacked the defenders from the opposite direction. They started by shooting arrows at them and then charged with swords and battleaxes. Caught between the two attacks, the men of Lorne lost courage and retreated. The royalists pursued them fiercely, and when they tried to cross a wooden bridge to escape, Douglas and his followers reached the spot and blocked their way. Many men of Lorne were killed, and the survivors fled back up the mountain. The Lornes who were on galleys in Loch Awe had planned to land behind Bruce but rowed away upon seeing their defeat. Bruce then marched through Lorne, a prosperous region untouched by English raids. They raided Dunstaffnage, gathered hostages from minor chiefs, and returned to Glasgow. A truce was briefly negotiated by the King of France, but conflicts continued due to English nobles in Scotland. Bruce besieged Rutherglen but had to retreat when the Earl of Gloucester approached with a larger force. In 1309, the clergy declared Bruce as the rightful king of Scotland, supported by the people. Bruce gradually gained control of Scotland while Edward II of England showed little effort to stop him due to his ineffective rule.|"['1.

In the early 1300s, Scotland faced invasion from England. The English army, led by King Edward, struggled due to a lack of provisions and had to retreat without a significant victory. Meanwhile, the Scottish forces, led by Bruce, faced challenges in uniting the nobles to form a strong army. Despite this, small groups led daring attacks, capturing English strongholds. The people suffered from famine and disease, resorting to desperate measures for survival. Bruce's strategic moves, like the capture of Linlithgow Castle by a farmer named William Bunnock, showcased the rising Scottish spirit. Despite fears of a powerful English retaliation, Bruce continued to defy expectations, leveling captured castles and expanding his influence. The story of Bunnock's successful siege of Linlithgow Castle in 1311 exemplifies the bravery and resourcefulness of the Scottish people in resisting English oppression.|"['1.

During the invasion, the English were outraged, but the Chronicle of Lanercost author noted that Bruce spared lives and homes during the raid. Bruce's siege on Perth lasted six weeks until he pretended to retreat, only to return at night and surprise the garrison, leading to their defeat. Subsequently, Bruce's forces ravaged Hexham, Corbridge, and Durham. After a failed attempt at Carlisle and Berwick, Bruce successfully captured strongholds in Galloway and Dumfries. Archie Forbes proposed to capture Dunottar castle to prevent English diversions. With a hundred men, Archie disguised himself and William Orr as peasants to sneak up on Dunottar. The castle, well-fortified, posed a challenge for a direct assault, prompting Archie to plan a strategic surprise attack.|"['1.

In a small village, two strangers, Archie and his men, devised a plan to liberate the town from English control. They learned that the garrison was heavily guarded with only ten men allowed to leave at a time. To overcome this, Archie planned a daring attack. Under the guise of selling fish, they would ambush the guards while the hidden men would storm in. The fisherman, a true Scot, agreed to help by ensuring the hidden men were safely concealed. Challenges arose as the drawbridge was raised immediately after crossing, cutting off any aid. Despite this, Archie remained determined to free the village.

The wind battered the boat as it struggled towards Dunottar harbor, barely holding on through the night. The vessel, showing signs of the fierce storm, finally made it to port. Despite the perilous journey, the crew managed to avoid disaster. The boat was in a sorry state, with its bulwarks washed away.

The castle had been reduced to rubble as usual, freeing the districts of Tweeddale and Galloway from English control except for the Castle of Jedburgh. Earl Randolph, along with Archie Forbes, struggled to seize the impregnable Edinburgh Castle held by the English since 1296. A soldier named William Francus revealed a hidden path up the steep rock face. With thirty men, Randolph and Archie planned a surprise attack. Under Francus's guidance, they scaled the treacherous cliff, facing danger and near discovery. Gasping for breath, they reached a ledge near the castle wall.

At the set time, more than 100,000 men gathered at Berwick, including 40,000 men-at-arms, archers, and pikemen. The army was well-equipped with war supplies, provisions, and tents. It was one of the largest and best-prepared armies led by Edward I into Scotland. Only four English nobles were absent, but their feudal arrays were sent under relatives' command. Notable leaders included the Earls of Gloucester, Pembroke, Hereford, and Angus, among others. Meanwhile, Bruce mustered loyal men at Torwood near Stirling, including Edward Bruce, Sir James Douglas, Randolph, Earl of Moray, and others, totaling 30,000 fighters.

King Edward's experienced generals planned to relieve Stirling Castle without engaging in a pitched battle on the enemy's chosen ground. Lord Clifford led 800 men-at-arms to cross the Bannock and reach Stirling. Meanwhile, Randolph and Douglas overlooked the low ground near St. Ninians. English horsemen approached, but Randolph and Archie Forbes intercepted them. The Scottish pikemen, led by Archie, repelled the cavalry despite being outnumbered. Douglas sought to aid Randolph, but King Bruce insisted Randolph fight alone. Eventually, Douglas intervened, causing the English to retreat. The Scottish army cheered the victory. As the English army approached, a council was held. The Earls of Gloucester and Hereford advanced too far, leading to a confrontation. Sir Henry de Bohun charged at King Bruce, who, unarmored, swiftly defeated him with an axe. The Scottish troops were inspired by this act of bravery.|"[""1.
