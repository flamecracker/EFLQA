Dreams are often just that - dreams. Anne had always fancied living by a brook, but she never truly believed it would happen. Despite this, she found herself feeling nearly perfectly happy. The only thing that dampened her spirits was her red hair. She lamented that she could imagine away her freckles and green eyes, but her red hair was a sorrow she couldn't shake. She longed for black hair like a raven's wing or gold hair rippling from an alabaster brow. Yet, she knew she would never be angelically good, according to Mrs. Spencer.

"Mrs. Spencer had not mentioned the child falling out of the buggy, nor had Matthew done anything remarkable. They had simply turned a corner and found themselves on the “Avenue.” The locals in Newbridge called it that - a road lined with old apple trees forming a canopy of white blooms. Underneath, a purple twilight filled the air, with a glimpse of a painted sunset far ahead. The child was awestruck, gazing at the beauty above. Even as they left the Avenue and passed through Newbridge, she remained silent. Matthew, noticing her quietness, assumed she was tired and hungry, but the child was simply captivated by the scenery. She expressed how the Avenue was beyond words like ""pretty"" or ""beautiful"" and suggested calling it the ""White Way of Delight."" The child longed for a real home, finding comfort in the thought of it."|"['1.

She opened her eyes and looked around. They stood on a hilltop. The sun had set, painting the sky marigold. A dark church spire stood out against the colorful sky. Below, a valley stretched with farmsteads along a rising slope. The child’s eyes moved eagerly, finally resting on a distant white house surrounded by blossoming trees. A bright star shone above, guiding and promising. “No, she didn’t want me,” the child whispered. “I felt it was home as soon as I saw it. It feels like a dream. I’ve pinched myself so many times today to check if it’s real.” With a sigh, she fell silent. Matthew felt uneasy, knowing he had to tell her the truth - Green Gables wouldn't be her home.

Marilla was considering where to place Anne for the night. She had set up a bed in the kitchen for the expected boy, but it didn't seem right for a girl. The spare room was not suitable, so the only option left was the east gable room. Marilla lit a candle and asked Anne to follow her, who did so quietly, taking her hat and bag. The room was very clean, almost painfully so. Anne mentioned having two skimpy nightgowns made by the asylum matron. The room had whitewashed walls, a bare floor with a braided mat, an old-fashioned bed, a three-corner table with a red velvet pin-cushion, a small mirror, a window with a muslin frill, and a wash-stand.

Anne was full of curiosity and imagination, wanting to name everything around her. She believed that even plants like geraniums should have names because it made them seem more like people.

Marilla didn't seem to believe luck had anything to do with it. She saw this as an opportunity to rid herself of the unwanted orphan, Anne. Despite the chance, she wasn't even thankful. Mrs. Peter Blewett was known for being strict and harsh, with a family of troublesome children. Marilla felt guilty about handing Anne over to her. Mrs. Spencer hurried to introduce the two women, hoping to settle the matter quickly. Anne, feeling anxious, wondered if she would end up with this sharp-faced woman. Tears welled up in her eyes as she feared the outcome. However, a twist in the situation occurred when Mrs. Spencer realized there had been a misunderstanding.

Marilla felt dismayed by Anne's display of temper in front of Mrs. Rachel Lynde. She pondered on how to address the situation.

Anne stood in the gable room, gazing at three new dresses on the bed. One was snuffy gingham, another black-and-white sateen, and the third an ugly blue print. Marilla, unimpressed, emphasized practicality over vanity. The brown gingham and blue print were for school, while the sateen was for church. Anne longed for puffed sleeves, a current fashion trend.

Anne arrived at Mrs. Lynde's house only to discover she was not there. Undeterred, she continued to the church alone. In the entrance, a group of little girls in colorful outfits stared at her, intrigued by her unique headwear. Rumors about Anne's temper and peculiar habits preceded her. Despite the whispers, no one approached her during the opening exercises in Miss Rogerson's class. Miss Rogerson, an experienced Sunday school teacher, asked questions from the quarterly, directing them sternly at specific students. Anne, thanks to Marilla's guidance, answered confidently, though her understanding of the questions was uncertain. Anne found solace in the church's view of the Lake of Shining Waters during the lengthy prayer, feeling a connection to God and expressing gratitude silently. Transitioning to Miss Rogerson's class, Anne struggled to fit in with the other girls' puffed sleeves, realizing that imagination was easier in solitude than in a group setting.|"[""1.

Last Sunday, Anne attended church and had to answer many questions from Miss Rogerson. Even though she wanted to ask questions herself, she felt that Miss Rogerson wasn't a kindred spirit. While other girls recited a paraphrase, Anne offered to recite a poem called 'The Dog at His Master’s Grave' from the Third Royal Reader. Miss Rogerson didn't approve and asked Anne to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for the next Sunday. Anne found the text in church long and the sermon uninteresting, feeling the minister lacked imagination.

Marilla scolded Anne for meddling with her brooch, insisting she return it. Anne denied taking it but Marilla didn't believe her. Worried, Marilla feared Anne had lost it. She pondered the innocence of Anne's face and the possibility that Anne was afraid to admit losing it. Marilla found Anne's untruthfulness more troubling than the missing brooch.

Marilla searched her room all evening for the missing brooch but found nothing. Despite Anne's denials, Marilla was convinced she had taken it. Determined, Marilla moved furniture and searched every nook. Feeling deserted, Marilla couldn't seek advice from Mrs. Lynde. Anne, tearful but steadfast, refused to confess. The next morning, Anne admitted taking the brooch, overwhelmed by its beauty, imagining herself as Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald. She had planned to return it but accidentally dropped it into the Lake of Shining Waters. Anne's heartfelt confession left Marilla torn between punishment and pity.

Marilla was furious as Anne calmly recounted losing her amethyst brooch. Anne accepted the need for punishment but begged to still attend the picnic, pleading for the ice cream. Despite Anne's emotional plea, Marilla remained firm. Anne's disappointment led to a dramatic outburst, causing Marilla to question her behavior. The morning turned dismal as Marilla busied herself with unnecessary chores. Anne, heartbroken, refused to eat, citing her broken heart and a distaste for boiled pork and greens.

Matthew Cuthbert admitted, looking mournful at his plate of pork and greens, that Anne shouldn't have taken the brooch or lied about it. He felt it was unfair not to let her go to the picnic, given her excitement. Marilla, however, was astounded by Matthew's leniency towards Anne's misbehavior. She believed Anne wasn't truly remorseful, which troubled her the most. As Marilla went to mend her black lace shawl, she found the missing brooch caught in it, realizing that Anne had not lost it as she claimed. Anne confessed that she had made up the story to attend the picnic, feeling compelled by Marilla's insistence on a confession. Marilla apologized for not trusting Anne and decided to forgive her, allowing her to go to the picnic.|"[""1.

Anne and Diana loved their walk to school through the enchanting Lover’s Lane, Willowmere, Violet Vale, and the Birch Path. Lover’s Lane, a route used by cows and for hauling wood, was a favorite spot. Anne named it after a lane in a book they were reading. The maples in Lover’s Lane were described as sociable trees, always whispering. The girls crossed a rustic bridge, walked through Mr. Barry’s field, and past Willowmere. Violet Vale, a magical place without violets, was a dimple in the shadow of Mr. Bell’s woods. The Birch Path, named by Diana, was a narrow, twisting path lined with birches, ferns, starflowers, and fragrant pigeonberries.

Three weeks had passed smoothly since the start of the school year. On this bright September morning, Anne and Diana strolled happily down the Birch Path in Avonlea. Diana mentioned that Gilbert Blythe, a handsome boy who had been away visiting family in New Brunswick, would be back in school that day. Anne, with her many freckles, disliked the idea of boys and girls being teased in take-notices. Diana, popular among the boys, assured Anne that being clever was better than being good-looking. Anne disagreed and expressed her dislike for a boy named Charlie Sloane. Diana warned Anne that Gilbert, who had missed school due to his father's illness, would now be in their class and was used to being at the top. Anne welcomed the challenge, preferring to compete with older students rather than younger ones.|"[""1.

Anne Shirley was lost in a dreamland, gazing out the window at the Lake of Shining Waters, oblivious to the world around her. Meanwhile, Gilbert Blythe tried to catch her attention, but failed. Frustrated, he resorted to teasing Ruby Gillis by pinning her braid to her seat. This caused a commotion in the classroom, with Ruby believing her hair was being pulled out. Mr. Phillips, the teacher, reprimanded the students for their misbehavior, and Anne, startled from her daydream, shot Gilbert an angry look. The classroom was in chaos, with students whispering, drawing on slates, and even driving crickets up and down the aisles. In the end, Anne was asked to stand in front of the blackboard as a punishment for the disruption.|"['1.

"Anne would have much preferred a whipping to this punishment that made her sensitive spirit tremble like a whip. With a white, determined face, she followed Mr. Phillips' instructions. He took a chalk crayon and wrote on the blackboard above her head. Anne stood there for the rest of the afternoon with those words above her. Despite her humiliation, she did not cry or hang her head. Anger burned in her heart, giving her strength. She faced Diana's sympathy, Charlie Sloane's disapproval, and Josie Pye's malice with resentful eyes and flushed cheeks. As for Gilbert Blythe, she refused to even look at him. She vowed to never look or speak to him again. Anne walked past him disdainfully, ignoring everyone's reactions. Diana, torn between reproach and admiration, whispered, ""How could you, Anne?"" She explained that Gilbert teases all the girls and had never apologized before.

Ruby Gillis, catching a glimpse, described Anne's complexion as ""so white, with awful little red spots."" To Anne, this was a dreadful situation. Being singled out for punishment and seated next to a boy, especially Gilbert Blythe, was unbearable.

Anne was excitedly sharing stories of ghostly encounters with Marilla, but her vivid imagination led her to fear the haunted woods near Green Gables. Despite Anne's pleas and tears, Marilla sternly sent her to Barry's, through the spruce grove, as a lesson. Anne, trembling with fear, obeyed Marilla and marched through the dark and eerie path, haunted by her own creations. Every shadow seemed to harbor goblins, and the rustling leaves felt like icy hands reaching out to her. The night sounds intensified her terror, making her flee across Mr. William Bell's field to the safety of the Barrys' kitchen.

"Anne had to endure more than two weeks of various mishaps. Nearly a month had passed since the liniment cake incident, and it was time for her to find herself in fresh trouble. Little mistakes, like pouring milk into a basket of yarn instead of the pigs’ bucket and absentmindedly falling off a log bridge, didn't seem to faze her much. Everything was going well until after tea, when they found themselves in the Barry garden, looking for mischief. The game of ""daring"" was popular in Avonlea that summer. It began with the boys but soon captured the girls' attention. The girls were daring each other to do silly things. Anne dared Josie Pye to walk along the top of the board fence. Josie accepted the challenge with ease, showing off her skill. Then, Anne climbed the roof, causing a mix of excitement and concern among her classmates. As she walked along the ridgepole, disaster struck, and she fell. Thankfully, she landed on the porch roof, avoiding a more serious injury.

Anne sighed and went to the backyard where the new moon shone through the leafless branches. Matthew was splitting wood. Anne sat on a block, discussing the concert. “It’s going to be a good concert. You’ll do fine,” he said, smiling. They were best friends, and Matthew was glad he didn’t have to raise her. He could spoil her as he pleased. A little appreciation does as much good as strict upbringing. Suddenly, Matthew had a bad moment. Anne and her friends were practicing in the sitting room. They chatted about the dialogue and concert. Matthew watched shyly from the shadows, noticing something different about Anne. He couldn’t pinpoint it. After the girls left, Matthew pondered. Anne wasn’t dressed like the others. Marilla always dressed her plainly, unlike the other girls. Matthew realized Anne’s sleeves were different. He wondered why Marilla didn’t dress her in brighter colors like the other girls.|"['1.

Marilla, a wise guardian, raised the young girl. Matthew, wanting to gift her a pretty dress like Diana Barry's, decided to buy one for Christmas. He headed to Carmody to purchase it, opting for Samuel Lawson's store to avoid William Blair's daughters, whom he found intimidating. However, to his dismay, Samuel's store now had a fashionable lady clerk who overwhelmed him with her bangles and charm. Nervous and flustered, Matthew awkwardly tried to buy hayseed to cover his embarrassment. After the awkward encounter, he returned home with brown sugar instead, much to Marilla's confusion. She questioned his choice of sugar, as it was not their usual type, leading Matthew to regret his decision to venture to a different store.|"[""1.

"When Matthew pondered the situation, he realized a woman was needed to handle it. Marilla was not an option, as he believed she would immediately dismiss his idea. So, Mrs. Lynde was his only choice in Avonlea. Matthew sought her advice, and she gladly took charge. ""Choose a dress for Anne? Of course, I will. I'll go to Carmody tomorrow and handle it. Do you have a specific idea? No? Then, I'll decide. I think a rich brown would suit Anne, and William Blair has some lovely gloria fabric. Maybe I should make it, too, to keep it a surprise?

Marilla noticed Matthew acting mysteriously for two weeks, until Mrs. Lynde revealed the reason on Christmas Eve - a new dress for Anne. Marilla, though skeptical of Mrs. Lynde's explanation, appreciated the gesture. Christmas morning arrived with a beautiful snowy landscape that delighted Anne. She expressed her joy to Marilla and Matthew, grateful for the white Christmas. Matthew shyly presented the dress to Anne, who admired it with awe. The dress was a soft brown gloria with silk-like gloss, featuring frills, shirrings, and elaborate pintucked waist. The highlight was the sleeves - long cuffs with beautiful puffs, shirring, and brown-silk ribbon bows. Anne was thrilled and grateful for the lovely gift.|"['1.

Anne was ecstatic about the dress Matthew got her. She admired the puffed sleeves and the matching hair ribbon from Mrs. Lynde. Marilla, interrupting the moment, urged Anne to eat breakfast. Anne, however, was too captivated by the dress to focus on food. Diana then surprised Anne with a box from Aunt Josephine containing dainty kid slippers. Anne was overjoyed and felt it was providential as she wouldn't need to borrow Ruby's oversized slippers anymore. Diana shared some gossip about Rob Wright and Gertie Pye, leaving Anne amused.

The story unfolded with love, jealousy, and tragedy, ending in a funeral rather than a wedding. Diana explained how she crafted the proposal scene with much care and how Cordelia's jealousy led to a tragic end.

Diana from Matthew's school admired Anne's imaginative stories and wished she had a similar talent. Anne suggested starting a story club to practice writing together. Initially, it was just Anne and Diana, but they soon invited Jane and Ruby to join. They met weekly to share and discuss their stories. Anne wrote under the name Rosamond Montmorency. Each girl had to read her story aloud, and they critiqued each other's work. Marilla thought it was a waste of time, but Anne believed it was a valuable exercise in cultivating imagination.

Anne was filled with regret after buying a bottle of hair dye from a peddler. The peddler, a German Jew, shared his story of working hard to bring his family from Germany, which touched Anne's heart. Tempted by the promise of raven-black hair, Anne bought the dye for fifty cents, applying it eagerly. To her dismay, the dye turned her hair a dreadful color that wouldn't wash off.

Anne and her friends were discussing a plan by the pond. Anne suggested they act out the story of Elaine from a poem they studied in school. They were at Orchard Slope, standing by a birch-fringed headland with a platform for fishermen. Anne, Diana, Ruby, and Jane spent their summer days at the pond after their old play spot, Idlewild, was no more. They enjoyed fishing for trout and rowing in a dory. Anne admired Elaine, a character from the poem, and wished for the romantic days of Camelot. Though they had analyzed the poem thoroughly in school, the characters still fascinated them. Anne, feeling a connection to Elaine due to her red hair, sought validation from her friends about her resemblance to the character.|['1.

"Anne's idea was met with excitement. The girls found that by launching the flat from the landing, it would float down the current under the bridge and end up on another headland further down the pond. This spot was perfect for reenacting scenes from the story of Elaine. Anne reluctantly agreed to play Elaine, insisting on authenticity. Roles were assigned: Ruby as King Arthur, Jane as Guinevere, and Diana as Lancelot. They prepared the ""barge"" with a black shawl as a coverlet. As they acted out the scene, Anne's barge started leaking, causing a moment of panic. Without the oars and with the flat filling with water, Anne realized they were in trouble."|"['1.

"Anne recounted her terrifying experience to Mrs. Allan the following day. She described how she prayed fervently as the flat drifted towards the bridge, with the water rising rapidly. Anne kept her eyes open while praying, knowing she needed to be alert to grab onto one of the bridge piles. Miraculously, the flat bumped into a pile, allowing her to climb to safety. Despite the unromantic situation, Anne felt grateful and focused on holding tight until help arrived. Her friends, Ruby, Jane, and Diana, feared the worst when the flat sank, but Anne was safe on the pile. Gilbert Blythe came to her rescue, helping her down into a dory as she clung to her wet shawl.

Anne hesitated briefly as Gilbert apologized for teasing her about her hair. Despite his sincere words, the memory of his past actions still stung. She recalled the hurtful nickname he had given her and the embarrassment he had caused. Anne's heart fluttered for a moment at Gilbert's earnest plea, but her resentment remained strong.

Anne returned to Marilla with optimism after having a good cry in the solitude of the east gable. She felt her nerves calm and her cheerfulness restored. Reflecting on her mistakes at Green Gables, she realized they were valuable lessons. The amethyst brooch incident taught her not to meddle, the Haunted Wood mistake stopped her from letting her imagination run wild, the liniment cake error made her more careful in cooking, and dyeing her hair cured her vanity. Now, her latest mistake would teach her not to be overly romantic. Walking through Lover's Lane with the cows, Anne enjoyed the serene September evening. The cows ambled down the lane as Anne recited poetry, feeling the wind's music in the fir trees. Diana arrived with news that Aunt Josephine invited them to town for an exhibition, sparking excitement in Anne.|"['1.

Anne mentioned how Marilla had previously denied her from attending events, like the American concert. Diana suggested asking her mother to talk to Marilla, increasing the chances of approval.

Anne excitedly recounted her experience at the fair to Marilla. She found the event splendid and was particularly fascinated by the horses, flowers, and fancywork. Josie Pye won first prize for knitted lace, which made Anne genuinely happy and showed her growth in character. Mr. Harmon Andrews won second prize for apples, and Mr. Bell won for a pig. Diana found it odd that a Sunday-school superintendent won a prize for a pig, but Anne didn't see anything wrong with it. Avonlea had a good representation at the fair, with Mrs. Lynde winning for homemade butter and cheese. Anne felt insignificant among the thousands of attendees. She enjoyed watching horse races, although Mrs. Lynde disapproved. Anne appreciated the virtues of not betting and having a minister's wife as a friend. The day was unforgettable, and Anne shared her fortune of marrying a wealthy dark-complected man and living across the water.

Anne was having a delightful and eventful winter. Her schoolwork was captivating, and the friendly competition in class was engrossing. Miss Stacy's guidance was instrumental in opening Anne's eyes to new worlds of knowledge and ambition. Under Miss Stacy's mentorship, Anne and her classmates were encouraged to think independently and explore new ideas, which sometimes surprised the traditional views of others at the school. Anne not only excelled academically but also expanded her social circle. Marilla, following the doctor's advice, allowed Anne to participate in outings, leading to the flourishing of the Debating Club and the organization of concerts and parties.

The story club at school is no longer running. We didn't have time for it, and I think we were tired of it anyway. Writing about love, murder, elopements, and mysteries seemed silly. Miss Stacy, our teacher, makes us write stories only about things that could happen in Avonlea in our own lives. She critiques our work harshly, making us critique our own too. I never realized how many mistakes were in my writing until I started looking for them myself. It made me want to quit, but Miss Stacy said I could improve if I became my toughest critic. Exams are coming up, and we all have our weaknesses. I struggle with geometry, Jane with Latin, Ruby and Charlie with algebra, and Josie with arithmetic. Moody Spurgeon fears failing English history. The exams will be as tough as the Entrance exams, and I worry about failing.|"['1.

When Miss Stacy left us after assigning our rooms, Jane and I sat together. Jane remained composed, making me envious of her steady demeanor. I wondered if my anxiety was visible, my heart pounding loudly. A man entered, handing out English exam papers. My hands grew cold, my head spinning as I took mine. For a moment, I felt like when I asked to stay at Green Gables years ago, but then clarity came, and my heart resumed beating. At noon, we returned for a challenging history exam. Despite getting mixed up with dates, I believe I did reasonably well today. However, the looming geometry exam tomorrow tests my determination. I resist the urge to study the multiplication table excessively. Later, I consoled Moody Spurgeon, who felt he failed in history. Ruby was in distress over an English paper mistake, which we tried to ease with ice cream. I longed for you to be there. Geometry exam worries linger, but as Mrs. Lynde would say, life goes on regardless of the outcome. Anne returned home tired but triumphant, except for geometry.

As Josie was ignoring Jane at the moment, she had to quiet down. Jane, with a sigh, mentioned feeling like she had experienced many things since morning. She should have been studying Virgil, but couldn’t focus that night. Jane noticed traces of tears on Anne’s face and admitted to shedding some tears before Ruby appeared. Josie then shared that Queen’s would receive an Avery scholarship, causing Anne’s ambitions to soar. The scholarship was for English, Anne’s strong suit. This scholarship, funded by a wealthy man from New Brunswick, would provide $250 a year for four years at Redmond College to the student with the highest marks in English. Anne went to bed that night with excitement, determined to win the scholarship through hard work.|"[""1.

Anne's homesickness faded, especially with her weekend visits home. The Avonlea students took advantage of the open weather and rode the new branch railway to Carmody every Friday night. Diana and other Avonlea friends met them, and they all walked back to Avonlea together. Anne cherished these Friday evenings, walking over the autumnal hills with the twinkling lights of Avonlea in the distance. Gilbert Blythe often walked with Ruby Gillis, a stylish girl who Anne and Jane didn't think would suit Gilbert's ambitions. Anne valued the idea of having a male friend like Gilbert to share thoughts on books and ambitions. In the Academy, Anne found friends like Stella Maynard and Priscilla Grant, who shared her imaginative and ambitious nature. As the students settled into hard work after Christmas, distinctions emerged in academics, with Gilbert, Anne, and Lewis Wilson being medal contenders, and various students excelling in different areas like beauty, style, and academics.|"['1.
