In the high Bernese Oberland, above the village of Kandergrund, stands a lonely stone hut under an old fir tree. A brook, the Wild brook, rushes nearby. The hut belongs to a man, his wife Elsbeth, and their joyful son, Toni. They live a simple life, content with their love for each other. Toni helps his mother and plays around the hut. On Saturdays, they eagerly await the father's return from work. One May evening, as they set out to meet him, they receive tragic news - the father has been injured.

Elsbeth was filled with sorrow, tears streaming down her face as she spoke to Toni about his father's passing, believing he was now in a better place. The owner of the Matten farm assured Elsbeth he would take care of everything for her husband's service. Left alone, Elsbeth faced new challenges without her husband's support, relying on her faith and her son, Toni, for strength.

A new interest sparked for Toni at school when he saw beautiful animal drawings that other kids were copying. He eagerly tried to draw them himself, practicing at home on any bit of paper he could find. Inspired, he attempted to carve the animals out of wood, starting with a small piece.

As he grew older, his school days ended, and his mother considered finding work for him. But Toni pleaded to stay home and become a wood-carver to help his mother. She was touched but unsure how to make it happen. Eventually, she decided to seek advice from the pastor, showing him Toni's carvings.

At the top of the pasture, there was a small hut surrounded by open fields. Inside the hut, there was a simple setup with a narrow seat, a table, a bed of hay, and a wooden jug on a round stool. Toni and the man entered the hut, where the man placed a wooden milk-pail, bread, and cheese on the table. After a brief exchange, the man milked the cows while Toni assisted by bringing them closer. Once all the cows were milked, the man filled a jug with milk, bid Toni good night, and left. Left alone, Toni gazed at the mountains around him, feeling a sense of loneliness. As evening fell, he thought of his mother and found solace in the sight of a friendly star. The next day passed quietly with Toni tending to the cows, eating bread and cheese, and carving wood in the sun. Another evening arrived, bringing the man back as Toni continued his routine.|['1.

Many days passed one after the other, each feeling long and endless to Toni. Evenings brought a sense of fear as the mountains loomed dark and threatening.
