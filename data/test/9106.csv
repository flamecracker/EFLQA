In the autumn of 1889, I learned that a few bison remained near the head of Wisdom River. I journeyed there and searched diligently, finding plenty of other game but no trace of the bison.

"I adore my nation's pine-covered hills, Her numerous sparkling streams, Her sunlight and her tempests; Her rough and jagged rocks, that raise Their ancient heads high in the sky In untamed, imaginative shapes. I cherish her rivers, deep and broad, Those powerful currents that flow towards the sea To join the ocean's embrace; Her cheerful fields, her pleasant valleys, Her shaded hollows, her flowery meadows, The sanctuaries of tranquil peace. I cherish her forests, dark and secluded, For there the wild bird's joyful song I hear from dawn till dusk; And there are more beautiful flowers, I believe, Than ever in Eastern lands were seen, In diverse, vivid colors. Her forests and her fair valleys, Her flowers that perfume the morning breeze-- All have their attractions for me; But most of all, I love my country's name, Those words that resonate with eternal glory, ""The Land of Liberty.""

"I adore my nation's pine-covered hills, Her numerous sparkling streams, Her sunlight and her tempests; Her rough and jagged rocks, that raise Their ancient heads high in the sky In untamed, imaginative shapes. I cherish her rivers, deep and broad, Those powerful currents that flow towards the sea To join the ocean's embrace; Her cheerful fields, her pleasant valleys, Her shaded hollows, her flowery meadows, The sanctuaries of tranquil peace. I cherish her forests, dark and secluded, For there the wild bird's joyful song I hear from dawn till dusk; And there are more beautiful flowers, I believe, Than ever in Eastern lands were seen, In diverse, vivid colors. Her forests and her fair valleys, Her flowers that perfume the morning breeze-- All have their attractions for me; But most of all, I love my country's name, Those words that resonate with eternal glory, ""The Land of Liberty.""

The next time I saw our Emperor, I asked to visit Blefuscu, which he allowed but seemed displeased by. The Blefuscudians are tiny, about six inches tall, with animals even smaller. Their laws differ from ours but are fair. Lying is punished severely, deceit is worse than theft, and promises must be kept. Good behavior is rewarded, and the Emperor values bravery and honesty over intelligence. Despite the good laws, the Emperor didn't treat me well after I helped him. To accommodate me, they made a large table and chair and sewed clothes from the island's strongest linen. The tailors measured me uniquely, and the cooks prepared my meals, which were served by many attendants. Meat portions were huge, and I once had a sirloin so big it took three bites.|"1.

One day, I found myself stranded on an island after my ship wrecked. I quickly set up a makeshift nest on a tree to sleep in and made a stick to ward off predators. When I woke up, the ship had drifted closer to the shore. I swam to the wreck and found it leaking. I scavenged for food and supplies, then decided to build a raft to transport my findings. I used spare ship parts and created a sturdy raft. With the help of oars I found, I navigated the raft to shore, battling the wind. I shot a bird for food and built a shelter for the night with the raft's materials. Despite my fears of predators, the night passed without any harm.|"6.

After I found a stone to grind my tools on, bags of nails, spikes, saws, knives, and other useful items in the tool chest on the ship, I decided to bring them to shore before a storm destroyed the ship. I built a tent with spare sails to store my goods and made poles from wood. I arranged casks around the tent for support and slept inside on one of the beds from the ship. I felt lonely and cut off from the world but kept busy fetching items from the wreck each day. During one trip, I found some tea and gold coins, which I decided to keep. I also built a secure home with a fence and a cave in the sand rock nearby. I marked the days on a post to keep track of time and had four loyal pets: two cats, a dog, and a parrot. My dog was a great companion, always ready to help, and my pets were my only friends in this lonely place.|"1. What did the speaker find in the tool chest on the ship?

I lived far from any ship routes, feeling lonely without loved ones to share laughter, tears, or thoughts. Roaming from the woods to the shore, I dwelled on my solitude. Yet, being safe on land while the crew was lost had its bright side. The island lacked dangerous beasts, and I salvaged supplies from the wreck. I expanded my cave to store the goods, turning it into a home. Crafting shelves, a table, and a chair, I transformed it into a cozy space. Working diligently, I improved my shelter but faced challenges like the roof caving in. To prevent mishaps, I built a wooden roof. I used a lamp for light, grew grains from husks, and cultivated fruits. After a year, I explored the island, discovering fruitful lands and clear streams.|"1.

Living on the isolated island, I found solace in the serene vale devoid of sea views. Despite the challenges, I toiled to make bread from scratch, fashioning tools from wood. Threshing grain, I yearned for sieves and a mill. My makeshift methods led to a hearty meal. Crafting pots from clay was comical, with some collapsing and cracking in the sun. The ship's boat, stranded on a sand ridge, taunted me. After futile attempts, I resolved to build a smaller boat. Eventually, equipped with sails and provisions, I embarked on a daring voyage around the isle. Navigating treacherous waters, I nearly met my end. Yet, my resilience and resourcefulness as the island's sovereign sustained me through the perils, fostering a spirit of ingenuity and self-reliance.|"1.

Returning home after a long day on the boat, I rested under a tree and dozed off. I was startled awake by a voice calling my name thrice in the wilderness - it was Poll, my parrot, mimicking me. Determined to catch goats, I set traps with rice as bait, but they were empty come morning. So, I devised a pit trap and successfully caught some kids. However, the old goat was too fierce. I tamed the young goats by hand-feeding them in a park I built. Concerned they might grow wild, I reduced the park's size with a hedge. My attire, made from goat skins, was comical compared to city clothes. One day, I found a man's footprint on the shore, puzzling me deeply.|"1. What startled the speaker awake under the tree?

In the Vale of Tawasentha, in a green and quiet valley, lived the singer Nawadaha. Around the Indian village were meadows and cornfields, with forests beyond, filled with singing pine-trees. These trees were green in summer and white in winter, always whispering and singing.
