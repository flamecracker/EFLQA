Stephen did not return to the River Farm until 1 a.m. that night; he was captivated by the pink bedroom. It resembled the Garden of Eden, albeit smaller. The room had a bright rose pattern on a trellis that outshone any flower bed in June. Stephen admired the room's beauty, thinking it was the only place pretty enough for someone special.

The serpent, a former employee, explained his presence due to reorganization at his former workplace.
