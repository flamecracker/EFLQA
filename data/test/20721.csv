"""I suggested that Pani and her daughter should visit the Recollet house. We have classes there, along with orphan children. We tried to persuade her to join before, but it didn't go well. She disrupted our classes and even threatened to run away. M. Bellestre plans to visit Detroit soon. His daughter is married now, and he might take Jeanne back with him.

They were fortunate to reach Barre before the storm unleashed its full fury, but the experience was terrifying. The lake roared like a stampede of bisons, waves crashed against the ship with relentless force, and the harbor was enveloped in chaos. Jeanne, overwhelmed with fear, witnessed a scene of desolation where earth, lake, and sky merged into one. The storm raged through the night and the following day, causing damage and claiming a crew member. As the winds calmed in the evening, Jeanne felt grateful and rested. The next morning, the sun timidly emerged from the gray sky, casting uncertain hues of yellow and green. The captain suggested exploring the town, which appeared bleak but offered a change of scenery. Despite the cold, Jeanne found solace in the beauty of the surroundings, from the sandy beach to the vibrant wildlife. Eventually, they continued their journey past picturesque shores and islands, with the autumn landscape transitioning before their eyes. Jeanne, filled with a mix of emotions, found comfort in the familiarity of the journey back home along the river.|"1. What was Jeanne's initial reaction upon reaching Barre before the storm?
