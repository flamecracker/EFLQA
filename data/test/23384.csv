Upon hearing the first alarm, Gascoyne quickly got up and dashed out of the door, followed closely by Henry, Stuart, and the captain of the _Talisman_, along with their armed crew.

The crew, silent and fearful, watched as the breakers roared around them, a sight that could intimidate even the bravest. Gascoyne, focused on the helm, seemed oblivious to the crew's unease.
