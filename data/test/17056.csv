The flood tide was expected in about two and a half hours, which would help raise the vessel.

"During the past few days, the midshipmen practiced running the motors and handling the craft on short cruises along the Severn River. One squad would be in the engine room, another in the conning tower, and on the platform deck.

Despite not being overworked, they were contributing to training future Navy officers. Jack Benson reported his encounter with the mulatto ""guide"" to the Annapolis police, but the man had vanished. They completed their training in the Basin and river, with a well-deserved rest scheduled for the weekend before demonstrating submarine operations to eager cadet midshipmen on Monday.

The surgeon nodded in agreement, impressed by the physical condition of the submarine boys. Their clear skin, bright eyes, strong heartbeats, and vitality set them apart from other boys he had encountered. As the submarine boy moved on, he sensed the doctor's wish not to disturb the patients. Lieutenant Commander Mayhew arrived, questioning the boys about the previous night's events. Although skeptical at first, he acknowledged their honor and the strangeness of their story. Mayhew mentioned a plot to discredit the Pollard submarine boats and ruin Jack Benson. He decided to question Truax for more information. The boys were instructed not to leave the ship without permission. Initially feeling resentment, they eventually understood and accepted the naval officer's caution.

Yes. From what I heard, he was the man with a black beard who drugged and kidnapped you on the white ship. Tip usually doesn't wear a beard. He grew it recently to hide from those who know him. He rented a house in Blair's Cove to observe. He had a tip that the training cruise would focus on this bay. Dr. McCrea laughed, impressed by Jack Benson's cleverness in getting you to confess. When you were brought in, you weren't really sick, just scared. The doctor gave you medicine to make you feel unwell. Truax escaped while out on deck with a guard. They searched but couldn't find him. Later, it was discovered he was hiding in Europe with Tip Gaynor. Mr. Farnum and Mr. Pollard decided not to pursue them legally.
