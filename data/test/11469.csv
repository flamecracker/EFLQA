Ned interrupted, expressing the department's tough challenge. The delicate matter rules out foreign involvement in the conspiracy against Uncle Sam. The focus shifts to identifying the active power's tools. The search isn't in Washington, Tientsin, or the American embassy in Peking, but on the road.

"As the four oddly dressed figures crossed the field towards the grove, Jimmie hurried over with an egg sandwich and coffee. The hot liquid spilled on his hand as he ran.
