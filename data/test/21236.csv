The Colonel had faith in his sons' abilities on the prairies, feeling proud rather than worried about their upcoming expedition. He was also driven by the pride of a naturalist, envisioning the recognition that sending a rare find to a European museum would bring.

Lucien watched as the hawk swooped down towards the squirrel with lightning speed. The squirrel, agile and quick, dodged the hawk's attempts by darting around the tree trunk, evading the predator's sharp talons. The hawk, determined and relentless, continued its pursuit, circling above the tree in search of its prey. Soon, a larger hawk, likely its mate, joined the hunt, intensifying the squirrel's fear. As the smaller hawk made another failed attempt, the larger one descended swiftly, capturing the squirrel mid-air. However, their victory was short-lived as a gunshot rang out, bringing down both the hawk and the squirrel. The scene ended with a second shot taking down the larger hawk, leaving a sense of finality in the forest.|"1. What was the initial reaction of Lucien upon seeing the hawk approaching the squirrel?

We owe much of our knowledge of natural history to explorers like Hearne, Bartram, and Wilson. They have revealed the wonders of the natural world, unlike the dry scientific classifications that can obscure rather than simplify our understanding. For instance, take the Spanish moss hanging from live oaks. It's not a moss but a unique flowering plant. According to traditional naturalists, it belongs to the same plant family as the pineapple, which seems absurd. In reality, they are vastly different in appearance, properties, and uses. Understanding a plant's structure, purpose, and benefits to nature and humans is far more valuable than mere classification. Crocodiles, divided into crocodiles, gavials, and alligators by Baron Cuvier, are distinguished by their head shape and teeth. Crocodiles have pointed snouts with a large tooth on each side, gavials have even teeth, and alligators have broad snouts with unequal teeth. These distinctions may seem unnecessary given the limited variations among crocodiles globally. Africa houses four true crocodile species, while the fifth is found in the West Indies and South America. Gavials reside in Asia, mainly in the Ganges, and alligators are widespread in the Americas. New crocodile species may still be discovered in Africa and the Indian Ocean islands.|"1. What is the main purpose of the explorers mentioned in the text?

Crocodiles have pointed snouts with a large tooth on each side, gavials have even teeth, and alligators have broad snouts with unequal teeth. These distinctions may seem unnecessary given the limited variations among crocodiles globally. Africa houses four true crocodile species, while the fifth is found in the West Indies and South America. Gavials reside in Asia, mainly in the Ganges, and alligators are widespread in the Americas. New crocodile species may still be discovered in Africa and the Indian Ocean islands.|"2.

Crocodiles and alligators share similar habits, differing only due to climate or food. Alligators are dusky-brown above and yellowish-white underneath, covered in scales that rise into pyramids on their back. Their tail has saw-like scales and is vertically flattened. They have short, muscular legs with webbed toes. Their head is pike-like with nostrils near the snout's end, prominent eyes, and oval-shaped pupils. When opening their jaws, their neck bends upwards, giving the illusion of moving the upper jaw. Their ear openings are guarded by lips, and they can close nostril valves. Their vertebrae limit head movement, making them slow to turn. Alligators lay eggs in sandbanks or mud platforms, protecting them from predators until hatched. The mother guards the hatching eggs and guides her young to water after they hatch.|"1. What is a distinguishing physical characteristic of alligators?

The mother alligator's first task is to guide her young to the water, where they are safer from predators like older alligators, tortoises, and birds. Despite her efforts, some young alligators still become prey. Once the young ones become more agile, they outmaneuver their larger relatives. Alligators, while fish being their preferred meal, will eat almost any land animal they can catch, even preferring it decomposed. They have been observed to kill large animals in the water, leaving them to decompose for days. Alligators have a slow digestion process, allowing them to survive long periods without food. They are known to employ clever tactics to catch fish, using their webbed feet and flat tail to swiftly move through water, surprising their prey with a lethal strike. Their unique hunting techniques involve using their tails to strike and kill prey swiftly. The mystery of why alligators consume stones and debris remains unsolved, with their stomachs sometimes containing objects like stones and sticks.|"1.

Many believe that alligators swallow gravel and earth to aid digestion, similar to how birds consume such substances. Some even suggest it helps distend the stomach, allowing the reptile to endure long fasts during hibernation. However, I find this reasoning absurd. I think the debris found in alligator stomachs is accidental, ingested along with prey or by mistake due to their indiscriminate eating habits. Unlike humans, alligators can survive even with severe brain injuries. African crocodiles are often perceived as more aggressive than American alligators, possibly due to historical interactions with humans. American alligators have become wary of humans over time, particularly in settled areas. The fear of humans is attributed to the historical hunting for alligator leather and oil. Despite myths, South American caimans, a type of alligator, can also exhibit aggressive behavior towards humans.|"1.

In America, particularly along the Magdalena River, alligators grow large and fierce due to the hot climate ideal for their development. The half-Indian, half-Spanish locals rarely confront these creatures, making the alligators less fearful of humans. Tragedies occur when people fall prey to the alligators, especially boatmen navigating the river. These boatmen, known as _bogadores_, sometimes carry rifles to shoot the alligators, aiming for the eye, the only vulnerable spot. Locals occasionally lasso and kill the alligators after an attack. Despite sporadic attempts to control the population, the alligators continue to thrive and pose a constant threat to the inhabitants. An incident involving a vaquero's daughter illustrates the dangers posed by these formidable reptiles.|"1. What is the main reason for the large and fierce alligators along the Magdalena River?

"""No one can say for certain what happened to the Natchez tribe. Some old Spanish authors claim they were wiped out by South American Indians, but this theory seems far-fetched. It is more plausible that the Natchez were defeated by the Creeks and Chicasaws from the southwest, with the survivors assimilating into the conquering tribes. This likely led to the extinction of the Natchez. It is possible that this location was once an ancient Natchez settlement, with the remaining trees possibly remnants of their cultivated orchards.

The mulberry tree, for example, is significant as it is the source of silk. Mulberry trees belong to the genus _morus_, with the white mulberry being the most important species, as it is used to produce silk spun by silkworms.

Listen closely! Did you hear that sound, like a rocket's whistle? Look! Something has crashed onto the tree, breaking branches! It's the kite!

"Buffalo hunting was a skill practiced by the Indians, where they used a method called the ""surround."" When a group of Indian hunters spotted a herd of buffaloes, they would encircle them on horseback and drive them into a central clump. With loud yells, the hunters would then attack the buffaloes with bows and lances, aiming to kill as many as possible. This method was used to obtain meat and skins for various purposes. In some cases, hundreds or even thousands of buffaloes were slaughtered in one hunt. The region where buffaloes roamed was characterized by high upland prairies and deep rifts called ""canons."" Sometimes, the Indians would guide the buffaloes towards these canons and force them to leap over the precipices. Other hunting methods included pursuing buffaloes in the snow or capturing them with lassos. The young hunters in the story decided to run down the buffaloes as their best plan of action. They left behind their belongings and rode out onto the prairie with their guns and pistols, ready to take down the animals."|"1. What method did the Indians use for buffalo hunting in the text?

"The brothers rode silently ahead, carefully observing the creatures in front of them. These were not buffaloes; their rough, shaggy bodies did not match the shining appearance of the buffaloes. Lucien explained that such mistakes were common due to an atmospheric illusion, recounting a story of a raven mistaken for a buffalo. As they turned their attention to capturing birds instead, they noticed two old ""gobblers"" and a hen. The gobblers were strutting and displaying their vibrant plumage, while the hen moved gracefully, aware of the attention she drew. The males, resembling peacocks, caught the hunters' eyes with their metallic shine. The turkeys took flight when approached, and the brothers each pursued their chosen target.

Lucien mounted his horse and rode out into the open ground, where he spotted Basil chasing a gobbler across the prairies at full speed. The gobbler ran ahead with outspread wings, resembling an ostrich. Both Basil and the bird disappeared behind a timber islet. Lucien searched for Francois but couldn't find him as he had gone in a different direction. Deciding not to follow them, Lucien returned to where Jeanette was waiting at the forest's edge. Meanwhile, Basil's pursuit of the gobbler proved to be challenging. The bird flew a mile and then ran like a cat before Basil caught up. The chase continued with the gobbler flying short distances and running uphill faster than Basil's horse. Eventually, the exhausted bird tried to hide but was shot by Basil. After securing the gobbler, Basil realized he was lost in the prairies, surrounded by similar groves of timber, unsure of which way to go. Being lost in the vast wilderness can be terrifying, even for the bravest souls, as the consequences can be dire.|"1. What did Lucien see Basil chasing across the prairies?

As they rode side by side into the twilight, Basil and Lucien faced a dilemma. The fading light made it hard to keep track of their hound, Marengo. Quick thinking by Basil saved the day.

However, a herd of javalies, wild hogs, pursued them, grunting and screaming as they ran. The horses and Marengo outpaced the javalies, but Jeanette, weakened from lack of food and water, with torn legs and impeded by a trailing tent, was in danger.

The young hunters decided to explore the edge of the thick shady grove in search of game. As they cautiously approached the prairie, hoping to spot deer or partridges, they used tree trunks for cover. The prairie was open, with only a few small trees scattered around. Despite scanning the area, they initially saw no animals. Suddenly, they noticed two small creatures about two hundred yards away. These creatures resembled tiny hares and were known as the 'little chief hare' among the local Indigenous people. The young hunters were intrigued and wished to obtain the skin of one as a prized possession. As they observed the creatures, a strange animal appeared on the prairie. Resembling a mix between a leopard and a tiger, it was identified as a bay lynx, also known as a wild cat.

The sudden attack by the hunter was too much for the female bear. Losing her grip, she was flung into the air and fell heavily to the ground, momentarily motionless. Although stunned, she was about to rise and retaliate, but before she could, Basil seized Francois' gun, loaded it, and swiftly shot her in the head, ending her life instantly. Meanwhile, the cubs had joined the scene, and Marengo, recovering from his earlier scolding, aggressively confronted them. The young bears fought fiercely, but with the help of their masters' rifles, Marengo was subdued. The mother bear and her cubs lay lifeless on the grass, a striking sight. The adult bear, weighing around five hundred pounds, had a rough fawn coat, while the cubs were uniformly black. This color variation is common among bears, influenced by factors like climate. North America hosts the black, polar, and grizzly bear species, with the cinnamon bear potentially constituting a separate species. The polar bear resides exclusively in Arctic regions near the sea, while the grizzly bear is known for its strength and ferocity, surpassing even the polar bear. The black bear, like its cinnamon counterpart, displays similar habits across various climates on the American continent, adapting to diverse environments from icy Canada to tropical Louisiana.|"1.

Black bears were once abundant in America before the arrival of colonizers. Due to the high demand for their skins, they have been extensively hunted, leading to a decline in their population. Fur companies have harvested thousands of bear skins over the past century from both white and Indian hunters. Despite this, black bears can still be found in remote, wild areas and occasionally in secluded mountainous regions. Surprisingly, their population has not been wiped out entirely, even though they are large and easily spotted. During winter, when bears could be easily tracked, they hibernate in caves or hollow trees, surviving on stored fat. Female bears give birth in winter but are rarely hunted during this time, as they retreat to hidden dens. This protective behavior helps ensure the survival of bear cubs. Black bears have a varied diet, including fish, fruit, and even carrion. Despite their scavenging habits, their meat is considered delicious, especially the paws, which are a prized delicacy among hunters.|"1. What is the main reason for the decline in the black bear population in America?
A) Loss of habitat due to deforestation

The bear was quickly skinned and sliced into thin pieces for jerking, a method of preserving meat without salt. Typically, the meat is left to dry in the sun over poles for three days to prevent spoilage. However, the adventurers opted for a quicker method by barbecuing thin slices over a fire. They dug a pit, laid green saplings over it, and placed the meat on top to dry and toast slightly. This barbecue method can preserve meat for months. While the meat dried, Basil used bear's grease to soothe Jeanette's injuries from the javalies. As night fell, they slept by the fire with their feet warm to ensure a good night's rest. Suddenly, Marengo's growl woke them, but they found nothing amiss in the peaceful forest night.|"1. What method did the adventurers use to preserve the bear meat?

Typically, the meat is left to dry in the sun over poles for three days to prevent spoilage. However, the adventurers opted for a quicker method by barbecuing thin slices over a fire. They dug a pit, laid green saplings over it, and placed the meat on top to dry and toast slightly. This barbecue method can preserve meat for months. While the meat dried, Basil used bear's grease to soothe Jeanette's injuries from the javalies. As night fell, they slept by the fire with their feet warm to ensure a good night's rest. Suddenly, Marengo's growl woke them, but they found nothing amiss in the peaceful forest night.|"4. How does the barbecue method mentioned in the passage help preserve meat?

Basil, thinking he had outsmarted the wolves, fell asleep near the meat. The wolves, observing this, crept closer and circled the meat, careful not to wake Basil.

The young hunters immediately recognized the distinct scream of the cougar in the forests of Louisiana, a sound they had heard before but never faced its attack. Despite the initial feeble and distant cry, they knew the fierce nature of the animal and the imminent danger it posed. As the screams grew closer, they sprang into action, gathering dry wood to create a circle of fires for protection. The cougar's howls drowned out all other sounds, even silencing the nearby wolves. With the horses stampeding in fear, the hunters and their loyal dog, Marengo, huddled within the safety of the blazing circle. Through the smoke and crackling flames, they could see not one, but a pair of cougars lurking nearby, eyeing the hanging meat. Despite the perilous situation, they stood ready, guns in hand, prepared to defend themselves against the predators.|"1.

The hunters realized their mistake in not cutting down the meat to prevent the cougars from trying to reach it. The cougars, unable to get to the meat, continued to eye it eagerly.

As Basil finished speaking, three loud cracks rang out almost simultaneously. Lucien and Francois' shots were uncertain until later, but Basil's shot found its mark. He wounded the cougar, which leaped into the fiery circle before succumbing to its injuries. Marengo tried to attack but had to retreat from the cinders. The hunters listened to the sounds of horses and Jeanette the mule in the night, fearing the cougar's return. By daybreak, they discovered the cougar dead by a tree, crushed by Jeanette in her escape. The hunters, tired from the night's events, decided to move camp to avoid the dangerous creatures in the forest, such as bears and wolves driven out by the flooded river. They saddled up and headed west, passing through a beautiful flower-prairie with sunflowers, malvas, euphorbias, and lupins.|"1. What was the outcome of Basil's shot at the cougar?

The bright sun shone down on the vast garden, glistening after a recent rain. Countless butterflies fluttered around, resting on the colorful flowers. Some butterflies were large with vibrant wings, while other insects added to the lively scene. Bees buzzed from bloom to bloom, collecting nectar.

The sweet fragrance initially refreshed the tired travelers, but soon a drowsy feeling set in. Lacking water and grass for their animals, they had to press on until they found a suitable spot to camp.

"On the third day of their journey, the travelers camped by a small stream in the prairie without trees. They used buffalo ""chips"" as fuel for their fire, a sign that buffaloes were close. The next morning, they scanned the vast prairie but saw no buffaloes yet. They noticed a distant butte, a lone hill, and decided to head in that direction in search of water. Lucien estimated it was about 30 miles away due to the clear air at their high elevation. Despite some uncertainty, they set off towards the butte, hoping to find water before nightfall. Lucien's lack of prairie experience made him underestimate the risk of traveling without a water source. Experienced hunters know the peril of thirst on the prairie, fearing it more than dangerous animals or hostile tribes."|"1. What did the travelers use as fuel for their fire?

Black Hawk wandered off in search of grass, as it was scarce nearby, almost devoured by unseen creatures. Basil, confident in his horse's training, let him roam freely, knowing he could call him back with a whistle. While Basil scanned the prairie, he observed strange mounds scattered around. These cone-shaped mounds, with rat-sized holes at the top, covered the plain as far as his eyes could see. Soon, the timid inhabitants, prairie-dogs, cautiously emerged from their burrows, revealing their reddish-brown bodies and white bellies. These unique creatures, a blend of squirrels, weasels, and rats, lived in communal mounds, with several sharing a single abode. Alongside the prairie-dogs were burrowing owls, a different species, gracefully moving about the town. Basil marveled at the coexistence of these distinct creatures and pondered the mysteries of their survival and habitat choices.|"1. What did Basil observe while scanning the prairie?

The owls flew up, landing nearby, then flew off again, some disappearing from view while others hid in burrows like the marmots. Surprisingly, marmots, owls, snakes, lizards, and agamas were seen fleeing to the same mound at times. These burrows descended vertically for a few feet, then angled obliquely before ending in a chamber, the true home of the marmot. The mounds were meticulously constructed with earth brought up from below, compacted by the marmots' feet and covered with grass. The marmots sunned themselves on these mounds, using the elevated position to watch for enemies and retreat in time. The owls, on the other hand, took over some mounds from the marmots, neglecting the upkeep as they only sought shelter inside. While owls likely preyed on insects and beetles, some believed they occasionally fed on horned frogs and lizards. There were debates among naturalists about whether owls were community tyrants devouring marmots, particularly the young ones.|"1. What animals were seen fleeing to the same mound at times?

Lucien and his companions were on a journey through the prairie, marveling at the marmot village. As they rode cautiously, avoiding the mounds, they discussed the mysterious creatures' habits and nests. The marmots' spherical nests, woven from grass and roots, were a wonder to behold. These nests provided shelter during the cold season, with a small hole for air. The young hunters rode on, wary of the dangers lurking around them. The landscape changed abruptly as they encountered a vast fissure, a barranca, blocking their path. The deep crevice posed a daunting challenge, with sheer cliffs making it impossible to cross. As the sun began to set, their thirst grew, and the distant butte offered a glimmer of hope for water. The travelers pressed on, anxious about the dark night ahead and the uncertain journey that lay before them.|"1.

The young hunter rode hard for five miles, but arrived too late to save the antelope from the wolves. Despite their disappointment, a stew of bear meat and parsnips prepared by Lucien lifted their spirits. As night fell, their sleep was disturbed by the restless behavior of their animals, alarmed by a mysterious snorting sound in the distance. Fearing the presence of grizzly bears or cougars, they took turns keeping watch by the fire throughout the night. With the break of dawn, they refreshed themselves, released their horses to graze, and discussed their dwindling food supplies. Concerned about their future sustenance without game in sight, they decided to climb the nearby butte to survey the surrounding landscape for potential prey. Setting off on foot, they hoped to spot buffalo herds from the summit to guide their next move.|"1. What lifted the spirits of the young hunter and his companions?

"Upon reaching the furthest point of the butte, the young explorers spotted a distant range of cliffs resembling low mountains running north to south. These cliffs marked the eastern edge of the renowned ""Llano Estacado,"" or ""Staked Plain."" Recognizing the features of this tableland, the boys continued around the southern side of the butte. The cliffs rose steeply, offering no easy ascent, with dark rocks and trees jutting out. While gazing upward, the boys saw strange creatures on the precipice above—large animals resembling deer but with reddish backs and white underparts. These were ""cimmarons,"" wild sheep of the Rockies, with males sporting massive, curved horns. Despite attempts to aim their guns, the creatures vanished quickly.

Our young hunters hesitated briefly, feeling alarmed upon discovering bear tracks. Despite the potential danger of encountering grizzly bears in the ravine, they were determined to ascend the butte for a shot at the big-horns. As they climbed, they noticed a faint trail made by animals passing through. About halfway up, they spotted a cave-like fissure that hinted at a possible den. Reaching the summit, they found a flat area with scattered pine trees and acacia bushes. There, they witnessed a herd of big-horns engaged in fierce battles, with the males butting heads in a display of dominance. The ewes, however, seemed unbothered by the commotion, continuing to graze as if unfazed by the conflict unfolding among the males.|"1. What did the young hunters feel upon discovering bear tracks?

As Basil spoke, he walked towards where they had cut the big-horn animals. He took out his hunting knife and began to cut one of the skins into strips. Lucien helped him while Francois went to watch for the bear. The brothers cut both hides into strips, making a long rope with pine branches knotted in. They tied one end to a tree and the other to their belongings and a stone to test its strength. Francois went down first, using the wood pieces as steps. Lucien and Basil followed. They quickly reached the prairie. After a quick meal, they rode west, planning to find buffalo tracks and then head north to find the herd.

The turkey-buzzard and the black vulture may seem similar at first glance, but there are key distinctions. The buzzard is more elegant and graceful, with longer wings and a tapering tail. While the black vulture flies heavily, flapping its wings and spreading its tail like a fan, the buzzard soars effortlessly with wings held upward. Some believe the buzzard uses heated air to rise without flapping its wings, a theory that requires further proof. Both birds scavenge for food, but the buzzard also hunts snakes and small animals. While they are often solitary, they gather in large groups to feed on carrion. The buzzard is more elusive and less likely to flock than the black vulture, often seen soaring alone in the sky.|"1.

They sweep through the air in circles, and when one spots carrion, it descends, followed by others in a chain reaction. By observing the vultures, Lucien deduced that they all start their flight within a few seconds of each other. If they know the speed of the birds and the time of arrival, they can calculate the distance traveled. The vultures wait for the carcass to decompose before feeding because their claws lack the strength to tear through tough hides. An incident occurs where the vultures cause a tree to collapse, exposing the carcass for easier access. The young hunters find the behavior of the vultures fascinating and decide to observe them further.|"1. What did Lucien deduce by observing the vultures?
A) They communicate with each other using sounds.

A new and intriguing sight caught the attention of Francois and his friends Lucien and Basil. While gazing at the vultures soaring above, Francois spotted a large white bird in the sky. Its size puzzled them as it flew gracefully at a great height, larger and different from any known bird species. It was not a gull, swan, pelican, ibis, egret heron, or eagle due to its unique flight pattern and color. As they observed, the mysterious bird began to descend towards them, growing larger as it approached. Despite their curiosity and inability to identify the bird, they hoped it would continue its descent to reveal its true nature, knowing it had already spotted them. Their excitement grew as they eagerly awaited the bird's arrival, unable to hide or seek cover from its watchful eyes.|"1. What caught Francois and his friends' attention in the sky?

As they watched, three voices exclaimed in unison, signaling the appearance of another white bird. High above, like a speck of snow against the sky, it descended in a similar path to the first bird they had seen. The two birds, both beautiful in their own right, spiraled down together directly above the vultures. The boys marveled at the birds' cream-colored bodies, glossy brown wings, and the striking orange and red hues on their heads and necks. The birds, with their orange-red beaks and captivating features, were a sight to behold. Ignoring the buzzards and black vultures, the king-vultures descended towards the carcass, causing the other scavengers to scatter. Watching the king-vultures feast on the carrion, the boys were both fascinated and repulsed by the transformation of the once pristine birds into a gory mess.

As they rode away from the butte, the group discussed the vultures they had seen. The naturalist shared a lot about these striking birds, piquing the curiosity of Basil and Francois about a new species they encountered - the king vulture. Lucien noted that the study of vultures has been hindered by overcomplicated classifications by some scientists, particularly the French, who tend to create numerous genera and species without a deep understanding of the birds' behavior. He argued that vultures and eagles share many similarities and could be grouped together, as both have similar habits and physiognomy. Lucien also mentioned that vultures, like eagles, can hunt for their prey and do not always feed on carrion. He highlighted the unique bone-eating habit of the lammergeyer, a type of vulture, which he learned from a bird feeder in Regent's Park. The conversation delved into the differences between vultures and eagles, pointing out that vultures have less developed claws and weaker limbs, making them less adept at hunting live prey or carrying heavy carcasses. Lucien also debunked exaggerated stories about vultures, particularly the condor, propagated by early Spanish conquerors. He emphasized the importance of accurate observation and knowledge in understanding these magnificent birds.|"1. What aspect of vultures did Lucien criticize some scientists for overcomplicating?
A) Their migration patterns
B) Their nesting habits

The condor is a large bird known for its fleshy crest that sits atop its head and part of its beak, a feature only found in males. These birds have a black-and-white appearance, with a dark body, tail, shoulders, and wings, but a greyish-white color when their wings are closed. They also have a milk-white downy ruff around their neck and breast. Young condors lack feathers and have a brownish-black color until they mature, usually around three years old. The condor's wingspan can reach up to eight feet, although some have been reported to measure even larger. These birds primarily feed on carrion but can resort to hunting sheep, lambs, and other animals when food is scarce. While they are not protected by law due to their predatory habits, condors are sometimes kept as pets by the locals. Hunters capture condors by shooting them near carcasses, lassoing them after they have eaten, or trapping them in enclosures.|"1. What is a distinctive feature of male condors?

Condors are captured by hunters using a unique method adopted by the Indians of the Sierras. The hunter conceals himself under the skin of a freshly taken animal with flesh attached. Positioned in an open area, the hunter waits for the condors flying high above to notice him. Once a condor swoops down and lands on the hide to feed on the flesh, the hunter grabs its leg, securing it with a rope. The captured condor is then led away by the hunter. These birds thrive in the Andes due to their breeding and resting spots high in the inaccessible peaks, providing them safety from predators. This secure habitat ensures the condor's survival, unlike other creatures facing extinction due to vulnerable breeding grounds.|"1. What unique method do the hunters in the Sierras use to capture condors?
A) Setting traps with bait
B) Concealing themselves under animal hides with flesh

E) Chasing the condors on foot"|B) Concealing themselves under animal hides with flesh|Yes
Condors are captured by hunters using a unique method adopted by the Indians of the Sierras. The hunter conceals himself under the skin of a freshly taken animal with flesh attached. Positioned in an open area, the hunter waits for the condors flying high above to notice him. Once a condor swoops down and lands on the hide to feed on the flesh, the hunter grabs its leg, securing it with a rope. The captured condor is then led away by the hunter. These birds thrive in the Andes due to their breeding and resting spots high in the inaccessible peaks, providing them safety from predators. This secure habitat ensures the condor's survival, unlike other creatures facing extinction due to vulnerable breeding grounds.|"2. Why do condors thrive in the Andes according to the passage?
A) Due to their fast speed

"Lucien explained that the condors do not build nests but prefer cavities in rocks or soil to lay their eggs. Little is known about their life in high regions due to the natives rarely venturing there. Condors descend to plateaus and valleys for food, mostly in the mornings and evenings, resting on high rocks during mid-day. They can withstand cold better than heat. The King-vulture, unlike the condor, inhabits low savannas and plains, preferring heat and feeding on carrion, dead fish, serpents, and small mammals. It is called ""painted"" due to its colorful head and neck. The Californian vulture, nearly as large as the condor, resides in the Sierra Nevada mountains, constructing nests in tall trees and feeding on carrion. It is found as far north as Oregon, where it lays two large black eggs and raises its young."|"1. What type of habitat do condors prefer for laying their eggs?

"Vultures are fascinating birds known for their shyness and wariness. They are difficult to approach, especially when they are not full from eating. Their thick plumage makes them tough to kill even when they are within shooting range. Vultures have long, graceful wings that allow them to fly with ease, resembling the flight of turkey-buzzards. Naturalists have identified five species of American vultures, including the turkey-buzzard and black vulture. However, there may be more species in America, like the unique ""gavilucho"" in Guayana. The red-headed gallinazo in South America appears distinct from the turkey-buzzard. As our young travelers journeyed on the buffalo trail, they faced hunger as their food supplies ran out. Riding through a desolate region devoid of game, they hoped to catch up with the migrating buffaloes to satisfy their empty stomachs."|"1.

As the night approached, the hunger of the adventurers grew unbearable. Their gaze shifted between Jeanette and Marengo, the mule and the dog, contemplating the difficult decision of which companion to sacrifice due to starvation. Both animals had been loyal and helpful during their journey. Marengo had saved Francois, while Jeanette had protected them from cougars. Despite their services, the group faced the grim reality of having to choose one to save the others. While Marengo had been a faithful sentinel and beloved companion, Jeanette, though known for her stubbornness, had also been a useful animal. After much deliberation, a unanimous decision was made - Jeanette must be the one to go. The group struggled with the weight of their choice, knowing that poor Jeanette was unaware of her impending fate. However, finding a suitable place to carry out this decision was proving to be a challenge. The landscape around them was barren, with no water in sight, leaving them to grapple with the harsh reality of their circumstances.|"1.

How far could this unusual area stretch? They couldn't guess the distance. Lucien knew such formations could go on for miles. If that was the case, they might never be able to cross it. Both they and the animals were thirsty and tired. Eager to catch up with the buffalo, they had rested very little in the past days. They started to worry. Thirst became stronger than hunger, harder to endure. Following the buffalo tracks, they rode sadly through a white cloud enveloping them on their fearful journey. They had no trouble following the trail, the heavy dust showing where the buffalo had passed. They hoped the animals had gone towards water, which kept them going. As evening fell and the hills turned blue, they left the gypsum ravines and reached the green prairie. The landscape ahead hinted at water nearby. Soon, they spotted a small stream. Everyone drank and bathed in the fresh water, washing off the gypsum dust. They were lucky it was freshwater; saltwater streams common in gypsum areas would have been deadly. The water helped ease their hunger, and they considered giving Jeanette a break until morning. While discussing this, they noticed Marengo had wandered off. They found him near a buffalo skeleton, picked clean by wolves. Lucien suggested making soup from the bones, and they agreed. They prepared to cook the bones, hoping for a nourishing meal.|"1.
