I had increased the lookouts as a precaution, aware that the Titanic had hit an iceberg. We navigated through a field of icebergs, altering our course multiple times to avoid them.

By then, we had picked up all the lifeboats and accounted for all survivors. The Leyland S. S. California arrived at 8 A. M., and after conferring with Mr. Ismay, we decided to head to New York for provisions and medical attention for the survivors. The passengers, especially the women and children, were understandably distressed, and we aimed to provide them with comfort and care.

During the tragic sinking of the Titanic, as the ship descended into the icy waters, chaos ensued. Passengers and crew scrambled into lifeboats, some overcrowded and ill-prepared for the frigid conditions. Amidst the darkness, a steward emerged with three oranges and a green lantern, a beacon of hope for the survivors. As the ship vanished beneath the waves, the green light guided the boats towards the distant Carpathia, a symbol of rescue and salvation. The survivors, shivering in the cold, clung to the hope provided by the green light as they awaited rescue. Eventually, the Carpathia appeared on the horizon, bringing relief and tears of joy to those who had narrowly escaped the tragedy. The survivors, including women from the Titanic's lifeboats, were brought aboard the Carpathia, while some of the Titanic's boats were left adrift due to lack of space. The survivors, surrounded by ice fields and sharp peaks, found solace in the warmth and safety of the rescue ship after a harrowing night.|"1.

I went up to the top deck in my dressing gown and found only a few people there, all curious about why the boat had stopped. We saw a card game through the smoking room window and learned about a close encounter with a massive iceberg. As we went back on deck, we noticed a slight tilt and were told to put on life belts. Passengers slowly gathered on deck, assuming it was a precaution. Soon, the order came to get in the lifeboats. Women boarded first, some refusing to leave their husbands. The boats were lowered as officers gave instructions. There was no panic, only a calm realization of the danger. As we descended in the lifeboat, a moment of anxiety arose as we neared the ship's churning exhaust. With no crew member to guide us, a stoker had to figure out how to release the boat from the ropes.|"1. What did the passengers notice as they went back on deck?

"We descended and drifted alongside the ship, the waves pushing us back towards its side. Boat 14, filled with men, descended towards us.

We hurried down to our rooms on C deck, quickly dressing and donning life-preservers and overcoats. Rushing back up on deck, we strolled around, gazing at the sights until the women were directed to assemble on the port side.

Since the moment Bruce Ismay's name appeared among the survivors of the Titanic, he faced harsh criticism. Many believed that as the managing director of the White Star Line, he should have stayed on the sinking ship to ensure the safety of others, similar to Major Butt and Captain Smith. Ismay's decision to board a lifeboat with women and children was seen as a lack of heroism. His survival was considered a stain on an otherwise courageous display. It was even suggested that Ismay influenced the Carpathia's captain to delay sharing details of the disaster until reaching New York. Ismay's quick arrangements for the survivors' deportation further fueled suspicions. The crew members' families, who were left in distress, felt neglected by Ismay's failure to provide their names promptly. Southampton was filled with sorrow as families awaited news of their loved ones, with some even succumbing to shock and grief.|"1.

The marine insurance brokers suffered their largest financial loss ever, with a policy valued at $5,000,000 but only $3,700,000 insured due to market limitations. The cargo, estimated at $420,000, was insured separately by the shippers. The ship primarily carried high-end passenger goods like laces and wines. The Titanic's sinking also resulted in the loss of around 200,000 registered mail packages. The disaster raised concerns about shipbuilding prioritizing luxury over safety, as highlighted in a prophetic article by Captain Roden. The Carpathia, which rescued survivors, incurred significant costs but sought no reimbursement, emphasizing the importance of aiding those in distress at sea.|"6.

"In 1909, a tragic collision occurred between the Italian steamer Florida and the White Star liner Republic, about 170 miles east of New York during a dense fog. The distress signal ""C. Q. D."" was sent up by wireless by the Republic on January 22. Despite the arrival of the steamer Baltic, which saved many lives, the Republic sank while being towed, resulting in the loss of six lives. This incident highlights the dangers faced by mariners, especially the peril of collision with icebergs, which has historically been a deadly threat.

Submarine signals on ships help detect nearby vessels or shores. These signals involve small tanks with microphones on each side of the vessel, just below the waterline, connected to the bridge. When the vessel nears another ship or shore, sounds from the distant object are picked up by the microphones underwater. Referred to as the ship's ears, these signals help officers determine the location of nearby ships or shores. Lifeboats are designed for rough conditions, focusing on easy launching, strength in rough waters, and buoyancy. Equipped with airtight tanks for safety, they can self-right and empty if overturned. These boats range from 24 to 30 feet, carrying 30 to 60 people, while rafts carry 20 to 40. Metal lifeboats are favored for their durability over wooden ones, being considered superior by the United States Navy. Rafts are also used on large ships where space is limited, with collapsible rafts being a popular choice for their space-saving design.|"1. What is the purpose of submarine signals on ships?
