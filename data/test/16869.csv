In the heart of the Ohio forests near the Miami river, a bustling Indian town with lodges resembling a vast apiary bustled with activity. The scene unfolded on a radiant spring morning, with dew glistening on the grass, birds chirping joyously, and the sky painted in a pure blue hue.

The Indian lodges, though simple in design, exuded comfort and practicality, each constructed with skins and bark in a cone shape. A thin wisp of smoke spiraled from the top of the lodge where a Shawnee squaw tended to the morning meal, while Hans Vanderbum, a lazy Dutchman, lay in a corner trying to steal a few more moments of sleep.

The warrior left behind had clear instructions: shoot the savage upon his arrival and, if he had a companion, call for help from his friends waiting nearby. The Miami warrior faced great danger, as the returning Indian could easily attack him from the rock above. The Huron quickly realized the risks and decided to confront the Miami rather than risk capture. Using his quick thinking and agility, the Huron managed to overpower the Miami in a struggle underwater. Despite the danger of being discovered, the Huron skillfully maneuvered to keep the fight hidden from the other Miamis on the bank. Eventually, the Huron and the Miami both raised their knives but decided to spare each other's lives after exchanging names.
