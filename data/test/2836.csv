In the mid-1800s, the United States faced deep-rooted divisions that led to the Civil War. The historian's task of depicting Abraham Lincoln's time is daunting due to conflicting viewpoints and local interests. These differences trace back to colonial times, where economic and intellectual conditions shaped distinct social and political identities in the North and South. Slavery and differing labor systems were central to these divisions. The South, under influential leaders like Calhoun, began to view itself as a separate political entity, advocating for a unified Southern party and policy. Southern leaders like Robert Barnwell Rhett pushed for secession, met with opposition from those who believed in a united South. Ultimately, the South delayed secession in 1851, recognizing that leaving the Union would fracture Southern unity.|"1.

"The unseen force of the ""great impersonal artist,"" as described by Matthew Arnold, subtly shapes our perceptions, creating illusions within us that influence our actions. History and fiction alike aim to unravel these illusions, revealing the deep-seated motives behind them. Often, we act not just from conscious thoughts but also from subconscious impulses rooted in our fears, intuitions, prejudices, habits, and illusions. This is true on both individual and collective levels, as seen in the contrasting ideals of the North and South during the American Civil War. The Southern society cherished a feudal aristocratic ideal, where landholders lived a life of leisure and honor, governed by social opinion and the code of honor. Meanwhile, the enslaved black population remained an unresolved burden, with Southerners grappling with the dilemma of emancipation. The North, unfamiliar with the Southern way of life, only saw the political side of the South dominated by wealthy slaveholders.

Until 1854, the Southern political strategy was to align with a party that advocated minimal government interference. This party opposed tariffs, supported states' rights, and frowned upon abolition. Douglas, a key figure, urged the party to endorse positive actions, risking internal discord. Some members, like Chase and Sumner, denounced Douglas for allegedly excluding immigrants and free laborers. The events of 1854 saw the rise of an anti-Nebraska party, the rush to claim Kansas-Nebraska territory, and the decline of the Whigs due to sectional issues. The Free-Soil party, opposing the Kansas-Nebraska Act, gained prominence. The Whigs, failing to adapt, splintered as some members formed the Know-Nothing party, focusing on anti-immigrant sentiments. This new party briefly gained traction but eventually dissolved due to sectional tensions.|"1. What was the Southern political strategy until 1854?

"On Washington's birthday in 1856, a significant political event occurred. The Know-Nothing national convention gathered in Philadelphia but quickly divided over the issue of slavery. Some members supported a convention in Pittsburgh, which aimed to establish a national organization for the Republican party.

Yancey tried but failed to unite the issues at hand. The commercial convention of 1859 supported repealing laws against the African slave trade. Northern capital was willing to finance Southern desires. Slavers left New York unimpeded, prompting Lewis Cass to act. Cass, Buchanan's Secretary of State, sent American warships to stop interference with suspected slavers, leading the British to cease policing against them. The movement to reopen the slave trade was seen as a defense strategy to boost Southern population and representation in Congress. Yancey gained support for Southern independence, with secession becoming an option. Robert J. Walker's efforts in Kansas caused further division. Buchanan's sudden change in allegiance to Southern extremists remains a mystery in American history.|"1. What was the main focus of the commercial convention of 1859?

Yancey tried but failed to unite the issues at hand. The commercial convention of 1859 supported repealing laws against the African slave trade.

Cass, Buchanan's Secretary of State, sent American warships to stop interference with suspected slavers, leading the British to cease policing against them. The movement to reopen the slave trade was seen as a defense strategy to boost Southern population and representation in Congress. Yancey gained support for Southern independence, with secession becoming an option. Robert J. Walker's efforts in Kansas caused further division.

The conflict in Kansas over slavery reached a boiling point when the free-state men decided not to participate in the election of the convention. This gave control to the pro-slavery faction, who quickly drafted a constitution in favor of slavery. However, Walker, a prominent figure, promised that the constitution would be put to a referendum. The question arose whether Congress could accept the constitution if the convention chose not to submit it. The free-state Kansans realized their mistake in not participating in the election, giving an advantage to the pro-slavery side. Despite efforts to admit Kansas with the Lecompton constitution, fierce debates ensued in Congress, with Douglas opposing the President's actions. The Supreme Court's Dred Scott case further complicated matters by ruling against the rights of a slave seeking freedom, fueling more tensions over slavery and states' rights.|"1.

"In the mid-1800s, the United States was embroiled in a fierce debate over slavery. The Dred Scott decision, a ruling by the highest court, stated that until a new state officially joined the Union, no one could stop the introduction of slaves. This decision was supported by the South and the Administration. However, the Republican party, led by Abraham Lincoln, opposed this ruling. Lincoln famously declared, ""A house divided against itself cannot stand,"" emphasizing the need to resolve the slavery issue. Lincoln's eloquence and legal expertise made him a formidable opponent to Stephen Douglas, who supported the Dred Scott decision. Their debates showcased contrasting styles: Douglas's polished rhetoric versus Lincoln's practical wisdom. Despite losing the senatorial race to Douglas, Lincoln's strategic victory lay in exposing the divide within the Democratic party.

Douglas responded with a strong political stance, emphasizing that regardless of the Supreme Court's future decisions on the abstract question of slavery in territories, the people have the power to determine its presence.

While some view Douglas's position as political maneuvering, others defend it as a sincere interpretation of the law. Despite differing opinions, Douglas's approach was seen as a strategic move in the political landscape of the time.

During the summer, Stephens decided to step back from public life. He had a sensitive nature and sometimes felt strange premonitions that a less sophisticated society might consider prophetic.

Stephens foresaw political turmoil both locally and nationally, especially regarding the Southern debate on reopening the slave trade. The split between Southern moderates and radicals was evident in their views on expansion into Central America. Even the moderates, like Cobb, expressed doubts and bitterness towards Douglas, a prominent figure in the Democratic party.

In 1860, as the Democrats split into factions, some individuals felt politically adrift. Unwilling to align with either Republicans or Democrats, remnants of the old Whig and Know-Nothing parties formed the Constitutional Union Party. Their platform centered on preserving the Union amidst growing sectional tensions. This party nominated John Bell and Edward Everett for President and Vice President, respectively. This move reflected a deep-rooted sentiment for the Union, distinct from mere belief. While the Republicans aimed to control the government, the Constitutional Union Party symbolized a moderate stance, bridging the divide between sectional parties. Notably, figures like Douglas and Bell embodied true Unionism, prioritizing national unity over sectional interests. The sentiment of Union transcended geographical boundaries, garnering support even in Southern states. Meanwhile, the Republicans, united in doctrine, faced internal rivalries, with Seward initially a frontrunner marred by controversy. His attempts to navigate political turmoil ultimately impacted his presidential prospects.|"1. What was the main focus of the Constitutional Union Party's platform?

"The election campaign of 1860 was marked by intense emotions and quiet tension. Party societies like the ""Wide-awakes"" for Lincoln and ""Minute Men"" for Breckenridge organized in military fashion. Threats of secession were openly made in the South if the Republicans won.

Douglas won in Missouri. Lincoln did not secure the popular vote majority. The Electoral College had Lincoln with 180 electors, Breckinridge with 72, Bell with 39, and Douglas with 12. The Republicans did not have a majority in Congress. The period from 1854 to 1860 in American history was shaped by applied psychology, with human emotions and circumstances driving the nation towards war.

Even before the split began, different kinds of politicians had started to act according to their beliefs. Those who avoided making decisions were the first to face the challenge when South Carolina demanded control of forts in Charleston Harbor. Major Robert Anderson had already warned President Buchanan that action was needed. This dilemma forced politicians to take a stand: continue avoiding responsibility, support the South, or declare loyalty to the Union. Buchanan initially hesitated but was influenced by two strong advisors. This led to a division among the President's followers in Washington. Some, like Cobb, chose to resign rather than continue the evasive policy. Buchanan's actions further divided his supporters, leading to resignations and a shift in alliances.

For a few weeks, a critical situation unfolded. Representatives from South Carolina arrived in Washington, authorized to negotiate for the transfer of federal property within their state. Shortly after their arrival, news reached President Buchanan that Fort Moultrie had been disarmed and its garrison relocated to Fort Sumter. South Carolinians viewed this as a provocation towards war, believing it violated assurances allegedly given by the President. Anxious about the unfolding events, the South Carolina commissioners confronted Buchanan, accusing him of reneging on his word. Feeling pressured and conflicted, Buchanan initially yielded to their demands but was shaken when key members of his Cabinet threatened to resign. Ultimately, the surrender of the forts was refused, and a tense atmosphere prevailed until the end of Buchanan's term. The emergence of the War Democrats and the prevailing desire for peace amidst the escalating tensions painted a complex political landscape leading up to the Civil War.|"1.

The start of 1861 in American history was marked by great anxiety. A Republican Congressman had warned of a looming storm, and events were quickly spiraling towards disaster.

"During a critical moment in history, Seward, the Secretary of State, made a peculiar decision that caused confusion. Instead of sending a clear message to give up the Powhatan in the President's name, he simply signed it ""Seward."" This led to a delay in the ship's journey to Pensacola. Despite Seward's initial embarrassment, he quickly regained his confidence. He assured the commissioners waiting for news that Sumter's faith would be kept and advised them to wait and see. However, his attempt to control the situation and delay the expedition to Charleston failed. The relief mission to Fort Sumter set sail without the necessary warship, the Powhatan, and arrived too late. Sumter was bombarded, and war began. Amidst this turmoil, Seward's ambitious plan to unite the country through conflict with Spain and France was met with skepticism.

The Constitution addresses the issue of decision-making during times of rebellion or invasion without explicitly stating who has the authority. Lincoln believed that the responsibility fell on the commander-in-chief of the army and navy, appointed by the people under the Constitution. He urged the Northern people to support him in this role, essentially asking them to interpret the Constitution through their support. Despite the risks involved, the majority in Ohio during 1863 backed Lincoln's stance, choosing military tribunals over traditional legal juries. The tide of public opinion turned in Lincoln's favor that year, with victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg contributing to his increased popularity. The North's advantage in population size during the Civil War was significant, but the ability to effectively utilize resources and secure munitions played a crucial role in determining the outcome of the conflict. Both the North and the South sought arms and ammunition from European sources, highlighting the importance of international trade during wartime. Lincoln's administration worked diligently to secure arms from Europe, facing competition from Confederate agents in the process. The urgency of obtaining munitions is evident in correspondence from the War Department, emphasizing the critical need for timely deliveries. Confederate efforts to procure arms were swift, underscoring the importance of securing resources to support military operations.|"1.

In London, Adams took the initiative to secure arms before receiving official instructions. He wrote to Seward, acknowledging his overstepping of authority due to the urgent need for assistance. This able diplomat's foresight was validated by subsequent documents from the War Department. A dispatch from Harrisburg highlighted the critical shortage of arms, hindering essential operations. The delay in arming was evident, with the War Department struggling to meet demands due to depleted supplies. While the Confederacy and some Northern States swiftly secured arms, the War Department lagged behind. Schuyler's efforts in Europe to procure arms for the Union were met with challenges and delays. Despite ongoing efforts, the Ordnance Office's report revealed the slow progress in acquiring arms. The Northern navy's blockade significantly hindered Southern trade, tipping the scale in favor of the North. Despite initial setbacks, the Northern navy's strategic victories at Hatteras Inlet and Port Royal secured key positions, disrupting Southern supply lines. The blockade made it perilous to transport munitions to Southern ports, while Northern ports received European supplies unimpeded. The Northern navy's success was briefly jeopardized by Captain Wilkes' interception of the British mail steamer, Trent, carrying Confederate diplomats, sparking public fervor in the North.|"1.

The enthusiastic reaction of the crowd to Wilkes's impulsive actions was fueled by resentment toward the British Government. In 1861, Queen Victoria declared neutrality, sparking heated debates about its legality, especially in the North. England was a major market for cotton, leading Northerners to suspect a bias in favor of the South to break the blockade and secure cotton. Despite doubts about England's true intentions, tensions rose, exacerbated by the Trent affair. While some in America initially supported Wilkes, cooler heads like Sumner condemned his breach of international law. Ultimately, the American Government yielded to British demands, releasing the envoys. The issue of relations with the United States divided English politics into three groups: those sympathetic to the South, supporters of the North, and a faction foreseeing the abolition of slavery with a Northern victory. Lincoln found allies in the latter group, including Richard Cobden, W. E. Forster, and John Bright. The Liberal party, then in power, encompassed all these factions. Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell contemplated intervening in the American Civil War for an amicable separation into two nations, while the construction of the Confederate ship Alabama in Liverpool further strained relations.|"1.

Lincoln's approach to slavery evolved through three stages. Initially, he aimed to avoid interfering with existing slavery in states but opposed its expansion into new territories.

Another General, Butler, refused to return runaway slaves, deeming them contraband of war. Congress passed the First Confiscation Act to free slaves used by Confederate armies.

"During the six months that followed the cabinet crisis, Chase showed his best abilities. He faced a huge challenge head-on. The government was facing a deficit of $276,900,000. By December 1862, only $23,750,000 had been raised from the sales of the ""five-twenties"" bonds, falling short of the expected $500 million. The banks blamed Chase for insisting on selling the bonds at par. To tackle this, Chase changed his approach and enlisted the help of experienced banker Jay Cooke. They sold bonds below par to banks, allowing them to make a profit. Cooke set up a network of subagents to offer bonds directly to the people. This successful campaign marked a turning point in war finance. Chase's efforts were crucial in establishing the Act of 1863, which led to the creation of the national banking system we have today. Despite his significant contributions, Chase's relationship with Lincoln was strained, and he eventually resigned from his position as Secretary of the Treasury."|"1.

The impact of war on a nation's life is a complex issue that often sparks debate. In the case of the Northern people during the Civil War, two key questions arise: Was the moral conduct of the North during the war commendable, and was its economic stability maintained? The moral aspect presents a conflicting picture. While a British journalist, William H. Russell, described a lack of mourning in Cincinnati despite casualties, local accounts spoke of intense grief. The commercial success of Cincinnati during the war, largely due to government contracts, further complicates the moral assessment. The economic statistics of the North during the war years show a significant increase in various industries like wool, coal, iron, and agriculture, despite disruptions in sectors like cotton manufacturing. The availability of vast unoccupied land in the United States played a crucial role in providing employment opportunities for those displaced by the war, unlike the situation faced by English workers during the cotton famine.|"1.

During the Civil War in the Northern states, there was a unique situation where pauperism did not increase significantly. Instead of traditional charity, people volunteered to support the government and the armies. This volunteer aid was provided on a large scale by all classes of the population that supported the Union party. The separation between the two political parties was intense. However, due to the availability of free land through initiatives like the Homestead Act of 1862, unemployed individuals had the opportunity to acquire land and become self-sufficient. The act allowed settlers to claim 160 acres of government land by living on and cultivating it for five years. The shift of populations from East to West during the war also helped maintain agricultural output. Additionally, the use of labor-saving machines and the involvement of women in various occupations played crucial roles in keeping the economy running smoothly despite the absence of many men who had joined the war effort.|"1.

The outcome of this financial strategy provided a significant opportunity for those deemed disloyal and parasitic to reap substantial profits from the loyal citizens and the Government. Not everyone who took advantage of this opportunity was careless enough to be labeled disloyal. An incident in the autumn of 1861 illustrates the behavior of those who professed loyalty but were actually parasites. The Quartermaster-General's report revealed urgent pleas from governors for clothing supplies to support recruiting efforts. The Government tried to address this by purchasing clothing from abroad, which led to protests from New England manufacturers who wanted to protect their interests. Meanwhile, American public servants were actively working to block Southern efforts to monopolize the munitions market. This dispatch from Brussels in November 1861 highlighted the successful control of key rebel contracts, which significantly impacted the Southern forces. The Secretary of War struggled to resist the influence of powerful commercial groups, leading to a surge in woolen mills and profits for those involved.|"1.

Until now, Washington had been cautious about Mexico. They subtly advised Napoleon not to overstep, but there was no direct objection. The State Department politely declined Napoleon's offer.

Every significant change among English-speaking individuals has led to the emergence of peculiar visionaries. In the United States, both the North and South had their own unique dreamers during the American Civil War. One such group, known as the Cleveland Convention, gathered in 1864 with the aim of replacing President Lincoln with Fremont. This convention was characterized by a large number of agnostics among its members who rejected any mention of divine assistance in their resolutions. Another faction present at the convention was extreme abolitionists led by Wendell Phillips, who denounced Lincoln and supported Fremont for his leadership qualities. Additionally, secret societies like the Knights of the Golden Circle, American Knights, and Sons of Liberty emerged with the aim of influencing political outcomes through clandestine means. Despite their grandiose claims, these societies were more about secrecy and bombast than actual impact.|"1. What was the aim of the Cleveland Convention in 1864?

The victory of the Union Party in November provided President Lincoln with a brief respite during a turbulent time. His firm support from the people was evident, especially during the darkest moments of the political campaign. The success of his policies, both domestic and foreign, hinged on the effective blockade strategy. Despite challenges with contraband trade, Lincoln adhered to international law, ensuring the blockade's success. British merchants attempted to circumvent the blockade by shipping supplies through neutral territories like Matamoros and the West Indies. To counter this, American cruisers implemented the principle of continuous voyage, intercepting British ships en route to these neutral ports. This strategic move, solidified by the Supreme Court, further tightened the blockade, ultimately weakening the Confederacy. Lincoln's decisive actions and strategic measures paved the way for eventual Union victory.|"1.

"Even now, Lincoln had not proven himself as a leader above party lines, but he found solace in early 1865 as opposition began to wane. The Thirteenth Amendment, ending slavery across the U.S., marked the culmination of his efforts. Democrats even sided with the government to pass this amendment. Lincoln, addressing a gathering at the White House, expressed the necessity of uniting all states and eradicating the root cause of discord. A meeting with Confederate representatives at Hampton Roads, seeking peace, led to a legend where Lincoln wrote ""Union"" and told them to add anything. Despite proposing a peace plan to his Cabinet, it was rejected. His second inauguration was uneventful, but his famous words emphasized forgiveness and unity. As the war neared its end with Lee's surrender, Lincoln's focus shifted to post-war reconciliation.
