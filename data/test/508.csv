The problem was resolved by assuming that the storyteller had misjudged the date by one day. Consequently, our companion confidently shared the tale at various stops, captivating at least twenty audiences with his vivid storytelling. He was the primary source of this intriguing news, bombarded with queries that compelled him to elaborate until it evolved into a full-fledged story. A former employee of Mr. Higginbotham, the deceased trader, corroborated part of the account. This ex-clerk revealed that the old man habitually returned home through the orchard at dusk, carrying the store's money and valuable documents.

As Dominicus relayed the news and engaged in trade along the way, his journey was prolonged. Consequently, he decided to lodge at an inn five miles before reaching Parker's Falls. After dinner, he settled in the bar, narrating the murder tale, now embellished to a half-hour saga. Nineteen out of twenty listeners believed every word, except for an elderly farmer who joined the group earlier, observing quietly from a corner.

David Swan lay peacefully asleep in the shade, unaware of the bustling activity around him. People on foot, horseback, and in various vehicles passed by on the sunny road near his resting spot. Some didn't notice him, others merely glanced his way, a few laughed at his deep slumber, while some even scorned him.

Several other figures were now visible at the turn of the staircase. The one in front had a thoughtful, anxious, and somewhat cunning expression, despite his lofty demeanor, likely from ambition and long experience in high positions. A scarlet-uniformed officer followed closely, looking uncomfortable and glancing around nervously. A portly man with a shaggy coat and a troubled face hurried down, carrying a large book. Behind him came a dignified man in purple velvet, hobbling due to gout. As they descended, the large lamp dimmed, casting shadowy figures that seemed more like ghosts than real people. Sir William Howe and his guests watched with a mix of emotions as these mysterious figures departed. The shapes were recognized by their distinct attire and mannerisms, resembling past rulers of the province. The procession continued, each figure tossing their arms in a sorrowful manner as they vanished into the night.|"6.

Passing through the narrow arch, I walked across the courtyard, which was lit by a lantern at the entrance of the Province House. Inside the bar-room, I found the old storyteller by a warm fire, smoking a cigar. He greeted me warmly, as my reputation for listening made me a favorite with older folks who loved to share stories. We sat by the fire, and I asked for some whiskey punch. As we sipped our drinks, the storyteller introduced himself as Mr. Bela Tiffany and began sharing tales of the mysterious black picture that used to hang in the Province House. The painting was so old and dark that no one knew what it depicted. The Lieutenant-Governor once stared at it, lost in thought, while news of a British fleet's arrival awaited his attention. The young Captain of Castle William and his niece, Alice Vane, joined him, curious about the painting's history. The Captain shared eerie tales about the picture being a portrait of the Devil himself, with a demon lurking behind it. Despite the chilling stories, the picture remained in the Province House, shrouded in mystery.|"1. What was the setting of the courtyard in the Province House?

Alice Vane, a young girl, expressed her unease with the dark fables she heard, suggesting that the true story behind them might not be as dreadful as imagined. The Lieutenant-Governor, her relative, interrupted his thoughts to explain the history behind a mysterious portrait in the house. He revealed it depicted Edward Randolph, a controversial figure in New England's past. Captain Lincoln chimed in, recounting the curse said to haunt Randolph, affecting his life and death. The Lieutenant-Governor dismissed the tales as myths, criticizing the historian Dr. Cotton Mather for spreading fanciful stories. Alice wondered if such legends held moral lessons, hinting at the power of a people's curse on rulers. The Lieutenant-Governor, though initially dismissive, seemed briefly moved by Alice's words, hinting at deeper emotions beneath his authoritative facade. In the end, he made a firm decision to station British troops in the town, despite Captain Lincoln's plea for trust in the people's loyalty.|"1. What did Alice Vane express unease with in the text?

The elderly lady, with a mysterious demeanor that captivated the group, revealed that she had readied her burial garments years prior. She had chosen a fine linen shroud, a cap with a muslin ruff, and attire more elegant than what she had worn since her wedding day. Recalling an old superstition from her youth, she shared how it was believed that if a deceased person's clothing was not arranged perfectly, they would attempt to fix it from beyond the grave. This notion made her uneasy. She requested that when the time came for her to be laid to rest, one of her children should hold a mirror over her face. This way, she might catch a glimpse of herself to ensure everything was in order. The mention of graves and monuments led to a discussion about the unknown fate of mariners when their ship sinks, likening it to being buried together in the vast ocean. Suddenly, a deafening sound outside grew more intense, causing fear and panic among the group. As they sought safety, a catastrophic landslide struck, obliterating everything in its path. The morning after, smoke rose from the chimney of the now-destroyed cottage, with signs of the family's presence still visible. Their tragic end became a legend in the mountains, with poets immortalizing their story. Speculation arose about a stranger's presence that night, but the truth remains a mystery, leaving behind a tale of sorrow and unanswered questions.|"1.
