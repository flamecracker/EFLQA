Overcoming a quicksand is a challenging task that requires careful planning based on the specific conditions of the area. Sometimes, the best approach is to build a suspension bridge over the quicksand, supported by strong pillars. In other cases, filling the quicksand with new sand or loam gradually can create a solid foundation. Another method involves laying logs in a transverse network and allowing the structure to sink slowly as the quicksand shifts. Steel piles filled with cement can also be driven into the ground to block side drift. Tom and his team are determined to conquer the Man-killer quicksand using innovative methods, despite facing challenges from rival groups. Their goal is not just about money but about overcoming the obstacle and making the area safe for everyone.|"5. What challenges do Tom and his team face according to the text?
