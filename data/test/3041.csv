Senator Hoar prepared a bill for national authority over separate registrations and elections for Congress members. However, his party associates in the Senate were against it due to increased costs and citizens having to register at different times for federal and state elections.

"The argument in favor of allowing a President to serve more than two terms, as presented in ""The Federalist,"" is compelling and supported by international examples. It demonstrates that prolonged tenure of power does not necessarily lead to negative outcomes and can be peacefully transitioned when public trust is lost.

The presidential nomination process during General Grant's candidacy exemplified the complexities and conflicts within political parties, with General Garfield emerging as a compromise candidate.

Some time ago, the President nominated several individuals for important public positions that were already occupied. These nominations included the Collectorship of the Port of New York, the consul generalship at London, the Charge d'Affaires to Denmark, and the mission to Switzerland.

In the debate over the Tenure of Office Act, Senator Edmunds stood alone defending its importance, arguing that the Act prevented the President from having absolute power. Despite his efforts, he received no support from fellow Senators. Senator Hoar and Senator Evarts criticized the Act, stating that it restricted the President's authority and placed unnecessary limitations on executive power. The debate primarily involved Republicans, with only one Democrat participating. Ultimately, the bill to repeal the Tenure of Office Act passed with a vote of thirty yeas and twenty-two nays, leading to President Cleveland's victory. The issue highlighted the clash between maintaining privilege and discharging responsibility, with the Senate failing to enforce executive responsibility effectively. Efforts to reform the system by making executive sessions public were met with opposition, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability in government.|"5.

To address the House's issues, a new approach was taken. John G. Carlisle was selected as Speaker, and a rules committee was formed to establish new regulations. Legislative committees were postponed until the new rules were in place. The Rules Committee, headed by Carlisle, Samuel J. Randall, and William R. Morrison from the Democratic side, and Thomas B. Reed and Frank Hiscock from the Republican side, presented two reports on December 14. However, the discussions that followed were unsatisfactory. The focus should have been on empowering the House to carry out its duties effectively. By having the Administration present budget and legislative proposals directly to the whole House, the House could save time and ensure all members have a say in the process. This change would eliminate bias and facilitate prompt decision-making.|"1. What was the purpose of forming the Rules Committee mentioned in the passage?

During the Congress under Speaker Carlisle, a bill to repeal internal revenue taxes on tobacco faced opposition. Three prominent Democrats urged Speaker Carlisle to consider the bill, warning that letting a Republican take credit for it would be unwise. Despite attempts to negotiate party action, Speaker Carlisle refused to allow the bill's consideration. The Senate managed to push through significant measures, including ones regulating the presidential succession and creating the Interstate Commerce Commission. The House's main achievement was an act regulating oleomargarine manufacture and sale, reluctantly signed by the President. President Cleveland faced challenges due to old laws limiting appointments and salary payments, but he stood firm in upholding civil service regulations. His dedication to reform was evident in his appointments and warnings against officeholders using their positions for political control.|"1.

During the late 1800s, the Knights of Labor, a rapidly growing organization, aimed to unite working classes across the country. Originating in Philadelphia in 1869, the group remained secretive until 1878. After revealing its principles, the organization quickly expanded, reaching a membership of 500,000 to 800,000 by 1886. However, the Knights faced challenges due to lack of organization, leading to strikes and unrest. The American Federation of Labor, established in 1886, eventually replaced the Knights, focusing on trades unions. The government responded to labor disputes with proposed legislation, including arbitration measures. Despite efforts, the labor problem persisted, accompanied by emerging radical reform movements. The traditional reverence for the Constitution clashed with new socialistic ideas, causing concern nationwide.|"1. What was the main goal of the Knights of Labor organization during the late 1800s?

The appeal to the past, even a limited one like that of American institutions, has always been a key point in American political debates. The ideas of the Founding Fathers are not just studied for knowledge but also for inspiration. By interpreting their views, conclusions are drawn that might have surprised the Fathers themselves. The principle of strict construction, now associated with the Constitution, only emerged during the early years of national parties. It was a response to Federalist dominance and wasn't originally part of the Constitution's creators' intentions. The main goal of the framers was to empower the National Government, a goal that has yet to be fully realized. The idea of strict construction is a way to avoid complex issues by focusing on constitutional power rather than public good. This approach, while simple, can hinder progress by making the Constitution a barrier to change.|"1. What is the main purpose of studying the ideas of the Founding Fathers?

The Chicago outbreak in the late 1800s marked a shift in American politics. Anarchism, once widespread, was abandoned by organized labor. This created space for the rise of the Socialist movement, which quickly gained momentum. By 1892, the Socialists had organized into a national party, appealing for public support based on reasonable grounds. Although their numbers were smaller compared to traditional parties, they represented active intelligence. Socialist ideas began to spread among college students, artists, and intellectuals, shaping American society. Henry George's campaign in New York in 1886 also stirred popular demand for reform. His advocacy for ballot reform led to the adoption of the Australian ballot system. While Socialist ideas resonated in urban areas, the agricultural class, with significant political influence, focused more on specific grievances like the currency supply system. This led to a push for monetary reform, with the free silver movement gaining traction as a practical solution to economic challenges.|"1. What marked a shift in American politics in the late 1800s?

In 1885, at a meeting of American Bankers, a New York bank president discussed how the Treasury was limiting the Silver Coinage Act to prevent the gold standard from being replaced. In 1886, Chairman Bland requested a report from the Secretary of the Treasury on the Silver Coinage Act. Secretary Manning argued against silver coinage, stating that only international cooperation could fix the gold-silver ratio. His response lacked clear solutions.

"During the late 19th century, the Republican leaders strategically managed the surplus in the Treasury by increasing pension expenditures, especially towards Civil War veterans. President Harrison's administration, led by ""Corporal"" Tanner, generously rerated and granted pensions to veterans, even reopening old cases. This liberal approach resulted in a surge of pension claims, some of which were questionable and fraudulent. Despite lax investigation methods, numerous claims were approved, significantly increasing pension expenses. The pension policy was criticized for granting pensions to undeserving individuals, draining the Treasury surplus. Additionally, the government passed a river and harbor appropriation bill and a new protective tariff bill that favored American manufacturers. These actions aimed to balance revenue and protect domestic industries but were seen as excessive by some lawmakers."|"1.

The Tariff Bill, as initially passed by the House, neglected American commerce and left consumers vulnerable to price manipulation by other countries. Blaine, the Secretary of State, pushed for reciprocity provisions to counteract this. The Senate resisted until Blaine's appeal to the people, which highlighted the bill's failure to benefit American farmers.

During a critical time, the Republican leaders urged their free silver party allies to accept a compromise where the Treasury would buy 4,500,000 ounces of silver monthly. This move aimed to address issues within the party and secure unity. The bill passed in both Houses with Democrats in opposition and was enacted on July 14, 1890. Despite this political maneuver, public discontent grew due to profiteering during the delay in implementing the Tariff Bill. The public blamed the McKinley Bill for price hikes caused by stockpiling goods. The Republicans suffered a significant defeat in the following election, losing the majority in the House. The Democrats, unable to pass legislation due to Republican control of the Senate, focused on attacking the tariff through unsuccessful bills. The House showed stronger opposition to the silver movement compared to the Senate, reflecting the people's sentiments. President Harrison's message in 1891 expressed optimism despite the economic challenges. The President emphasized the benefits of the McKinley Bill and opposed free coinage of silver. The President's tone, however, contributed to tensions within the party, notably with Blaine, who unexpectedly resigned as Secretary of State before the 1892 convention.|"1.

The Treasury faced a crisis in 1894 due to a drain on its gold reserves. To address this, Secretary of the Treasury Carlisle sought to issue bonds at a lower interest rate. Initially, the sale of ten-year bonds faced slow bids until a premium was offered. This effort successfully raised the gold reserves. However, a unique dilemma arose where gold was accepted for bonds, but treasury notes could be redeemed for gold. This cycle drained gold quickly despite bond sales. President Cleveland highlighted this issue to Congress, but no effective solution was found. To stabilize the situation, a syndicate was contracted to provide gold. Although this was a temporary fix, subsequent bond sales helped restore the Treasury's solvency. Meanwhile, tensions with Great Britain over a boundary dispute added to financial pressures.|"1.

President Cleveland's unwavering determination during the battle to uphold the gold standard will forever be his strongest claim to fame. However, his handling of the financial crisis did not receive the same admiration. He seemed ill-informed about the extent of his financial resources until February 7, 1895, when Mr. J. P. Morgan enlightened him about the Treasury Secretary's power to buy gold with bonds. Despite this advice, Cleveland initially hesitated to act, only later regretting not following it. The overall policy of his Administration fell short of addressing the country's needs post-panic, with industrial stagnation, bankruptcies, and public dissatisfaction prevailing. Cleveland's focus on separating government and banking overlooked the people's urgent need for financial relief. It wasn't until later that he proposed a plan for national and state banks to issue currency, but his insistence on removing treasury notes from circulation proved impractical and hindered progress.|"1.

The passing of the bill in a similar form as it arrived at the Senate was clearly impossible without significant rule changes. Neither side of the chamber truly wanted to amend the procedures. Some Democratic Senators, aiming to maintain good relations with business interests, were actually against the House bill. Senator Gorman from Maryland orchestrated the Gorman Compromise Bill, which altered the original bill with 634 amendments. After passing the Senate, a committee of conference between the two Houses failed to reach an agreement, leading to bitter disputes. President Cleveland's involvement and the House's resistance stirred up controversy. The House eventually used the Reed rules to pass the Tariff Bill with Senate amendments, which became law. The public discontent with government operations in Washington heightened due to the perception that trusts influenced politicians through campaign contributions. This led to investigations like the sugar scandal, where Senators were accused of stock speculation and favoring trusts in legislation. Amidst this turmoil, a movement led by Jacob S.

Senator Gorman from Maryland orchestrated the Gorman Compromise Bill, which altered the original bill with 634 amendments. After passing the Senate, a committee of conference between the two Houses failed to reach an agreement, leading to bitter disputes. President Cleveland's involvement and the House's resistance stirred up controversy. The House eventually used the Reed rules to pass the Tariff Bill with Senate amendments, which became law. The public discontent with government operations in Washington heightened due to the perception that trusts influenced politicians through campaign contributions. This led to investigations like the sugar scandal, where Senators were accused of stock speculation and favoring trusts in legislation. Amidst this turmoil, a movement led by Jacob S. Coxey saw the unemployed marching to Washington to address their grievances, highlighting the widespread dissatisfaction with the government's handling of economic issues.|"6.

In the autumn elections of 1894, the Democratic party faced a significant defeat.
