Almost everyone gave him a small gift to help furnish the house. When the Russells moved in, they were wealthy and decorated it beautifully, as you can see now. But the first furniture was simple. However, the house was filled with love. The women sent quilts, tablecloths, and towels, while men made furniture. Even blind Aunt Margaret Boyd made a basket from sand-hill grass. The schoolmaster's wife used it to store handkerchiefs. Finally, everything was ready, even the logs in the fireplace. Captain Jim reminisced about the fireplace, where many memories were made. The schoolmaster eagerly awaited his bride, expected in mid-July. But days passed, and the ship was delayed. Concern grew as weeks went by. The schoolmaster, John Selwyn, anxiously waited by the shore each night. People thought he was losing hope. By mid-September, the Royal William was eight weeks late, and it seemed like the schoolmaster's bride would never arrive.|"1. What did almost everyone give to help furnish the house?

I was very unhappy that evening. I had a hard day with Dick, who was difficult to manage. Usually, he is good-natured, but that day was different. I was heartsick, so I escaped to the shore once he fell asleep. I thought about my father's tragic end and feared I might face a similar fate. My mind was filled with dark thoughts.

I even harbored a ridiculous resentment towards your china dogs.

I had a chance to closely inspect the scars on Dick's head. Dick's medical condition has always intrigued me. Lately, I've been researching the history of trephining and its applications.

Gilbert believes it's a doctor's duty to prioritize a patient's well-being, even if it means restoring health and sanity with uncertain outcomes. Anne disagrees, arguing against interference. Gilbert insists that Dick could be cured if his condition is due to brain pressure, not irreversible brain damage.|"1. What has the speaker been researching lately?
