The carriage rode through Naples, offering a view of bustling streets with people carrying goods on their heads, cooking, and working on various trades. The sidewalks were filled with families engaged in daily activities. Josie mentioned the beggars crowding around pedestrians. The road led to a series of villages along the shore, with people traveling to and from Naples. The carriage eventually stopped at an inn, surrounded by a noisy crowd of beggars and drivers. Mr. George and Mrs. Gray ignored the beggars and entered the inn, followed by the children. Philippe lit candles for the group, and they descended stone steps into a building.

The guide spoke briefly with Philippe in Italian before Philippe led his group down the wide stairs. As they descended and turned, a light akin to daylight emerged, growing brighter until they reached a large circular opening in the rock. The light illuminated a moss-covered platform and walls, where Mrs. Gray collected plants. Moving down more steps, they entered dark chambers hewn from the rock, revealing remnants of an ancient theater. The party explored further, finding old arches, columns, and frescoes. The guide, mainly speaking Italian with a mix of English, pointed out original features in the ancient site. The exploration concluded, and they returned to the surface. Mr. George led them back to the waiting carriage, passing through vineyards and groves on the mountain road.

As the carriage ascended, the views around them expanded. The Bay of Naples with its mountainous islands and a line of hamlets along the shore unfolded before their eyes. In the distance, Naples and the Castle of St. Elmo perched on a rocky summit came into view. The travelers glimpsed fertile valleys between lofty peaks, marred only by recent lava flows. The Hermitage, a white stone building on a mountain spur, awaited them. The grounds, with vineyards and mulberry trees, looked inviting.

When Rollo reached the top of the mountain, he saw a huge cloud of white vapor rising into the sky nearby. He wanted to rush closer to the crater but decided to wait for the rest of the group. The bearers put down the chair, and everyone gathered around Mr. George asking for tips. Mr. George calmly helped Rosie out of her chair, and they followed the guide towards the crater. Let's take a moment to understand what a crater is and how it forms. A crater is a large pit on top of a volcano caused by the ground sinking due to cooling and shrinking of the molten material below. Just like lead shrinks when cooling in a mold, the lava inside a volcano cools, causing the top to sink and form a crater. Steam escapes from small openings in the crater, forming a visible vapor column.|"1. What did Rollo see when he reached the top of the mountain?

After a while, the inside of the mountain heats up once more. Steam and hot lava start to escape from one of the vents in the crater's base. The lava becomes hotter with each eruption, enlarging the opening by melting and blowing away its sides. The lava accumulates around the hole, forming a mound like a small dome. This cone, rising in the crater's base, vents the steam while other openings get blocked by lava. Vesuvius, during Rollo's visit, had two craters with black cones emitting molten matter. Visitors observed the colorful cliffs formed by sulfur deposits. The crater's floor was covered in black, wave-like lava, with a large cone emitting steam and red-hot stones. Despite initial fears of the cliffs collapsing, the party watched explosions of stones and lava at the cone's top. The guide then led them to another crater with similar volcanic activity.|"1.

After a while, the inside of the mountain heats up once more. Steam and hot lava start to escape from one of the vents in the crater's base. The lava becomes hotter with each eruption, enlarging the opening by melting and blowing away its sides. The lava accumulates around the hole, forming a mound like a small dome. This cone, rising in the crater's base, vents the steam while other openings get blocked by lava. Vesuvius, during Rollo's visit, had two craters with black cones emitting molten matter. Visitors observed the colorful cliffs formed by sulfur deposits. The crater's floor was covered in black, wave-like lava, with a large cone emitting steam and red-hot stones. Despite initial fears of the cliffs collapsing, the party watched explosions of stones and lava at the cone's top. The guide then led them to another crater with similar volcanic activity.|"4.

While they stood on the narrow ridge at the edge of the crater, a guide led two young men down the slope. Mr. George saw the descent was safe as it was a guided path. Rollo and Josie followed the young men down the sandy track with ease. The floor of the crater was covered in black lava, surprising them that it was solid enough to walk on. The guide confidently stepped onto the lava, followed by the group. The lava was hard on the surface but hot underneath. Rollo and Josie bought lava pieces from local boys near the crater's center. As they ventured closer to the cone, steam obscured their view, worrying Rosie. Mr. George reassured her, trusting the guides' expertise.

Mr. George, a guide, left Rosie with Rollo and Josie to explore a volcanic crater. The group found a spot where locals cooked using hot steam and gases from the crater. Rollo bought eggs cooked in the steam. Mr. George ventured down the crater to explore further while the children observed two students using a metallic barometer to measure the mountain's height. The barometer measures air pressure, which decreases as altitude increases. By comparing pressure readings at the base and summit, the height of the mountain can be calculated. The students were kind enough to explain this to Rollo, offering a fascinating lesson on how technology is used to measure natural phenomena like mountain heights.|"1.

Mr. George was keen on learning about the barometer, despite never having seen one before. He was fascinated by Rollo's description and decided to visit the instrument. The students warmly welcomed him, forming a quick friendship. They planned to stay on the mountain until night to observe it differently and invited Mr. George to join. Rollo, though unable to go, supported Mr. George's visit. Mr. George appreciated Rollo's offer and agreed to let him lead the group back. He promised to return to the students if Mrs. Gray allowed. After exploring the crater's edge and collecting specimens, they descended easily down a sandy slope. Mrs. Gray, feeling safe with the children and Philippe, urged them to go home, expressing interest in their adventures. Rollo later informed Mrs. Gray about a development regarding their plans for Pompeii, showing some concern.|"1. What was Mr. George fascinated by?

Rosie picked up a guidebook from the table and flipped to a map of Pompeii. She hoped the town had few streets to make finding Mr. George easier. Unfortunately, the map revealed a complex layout with many intersecting streets. Rosie closed the book, thinking it might hinder rather than help Rollo's plan. Mrs. Gray suggested taking a carriage to explore Pompeii and Herculaneum. In Naples, carriages were abundant, with eager coachmen offering rides. Rollo and Josie set out to find a carriage, eventually selecting one with a good pair of horses. The coachman, upon their approach, opened the carriage door.

In ancient times, houses were structured differently from modern homes due to the absence of windows and chimneys. The people of Pompeii didn't have chimneys because the climate was mild, and they rarely needed fires. When they did, they used open vessels with small fires inside. Windows were lacking because glass was not easily made then. Openings in the houses served as windows, but they needed to be sheltered to keep out wind and rain. Rooms often opened into porticos, with a central open area called an _impluvium_ to let in light and air. Some houses had multiple courts, with gardens and subterranean chambers. Skeletons found in one chamber showed how people were buried during a volcanic eruption. Visitors today can still see these ancient structures and imagine how people lived in them.|"1.

Rooms often opened into porticos, with a central open area called an _impluvium_ to let in light and air. Some houses had multiple courts, with gardens and subterranean chambers. Skeletons found in one chamber showed how people were buried during a volcanic eruption. Visitors today can still see these ancient structures and imagine how people lived in them.|"3.

A) Atrium

The Forum, a public square, was surrounded by ruins of temples and edifices. The theatres and amphitheatre outside the walls were points of interest. While Mr. George and the students focused on theatres and temples, Mrs. Gray and the children were intrigued by houses and shops.

Rollo and Josie enjoyed exploring the bustling streets of Naples, where lower-class families engaged in various trades and activities outdoors. They observed cabinet makers polishing tables, iron bedsteads being forged, turners crafting with lathes, and women knitting or sewing.

The streets were filled with diseased and impoverished people begging for alms, even though Naples had established hospitals for their care.

Mrs. Gray understood the situation well. If everyone refused to give money to beggars in public, the practice of showcasing misery in Naples would end. She, Mr. George, and Rollo didn't give money to beggars and were rarely bothered. Rollo once gave a piece of cake to a hungry dog. Mr. George suggested Rollo take the ladies on an excursion to Pozzuoli and Solfatara. Rollo agreed and planned a trip to Virgil's Tomb, Grotto of Posilipo, and more. The next day, Rollo and Josie found a carriage and drove Mrs. Gray, Rosie, and themselves out of town. They passed by the public gardens and headed towards the Grotto of Posilipo, a famous subterranean passage. Rosie marveled at the journey until they reached the grand entrance of the grotto.|"1.

Rollo and his party visited the grotto, wide enough for two carriages, illuminated by lamps, bustling with people and carriages. Along the rock walls, curious structures and openings were visible. A chapel with an altar and a priest asking for donations stood on one side, while an ancient monument with a Latin inscription was on the other. They stopped at Virgil's Tomb entrance, where a gate led to stone steps ascending to a vineyard with a stunning view. Descending back to the grotto mouth, they explored caverns and reached Virgil's Tomb, a peculiar spot. Passing through the grotto, they encountered carts, donkeys, and foot passengers. Emerging into open land, they admired the scenery before reaching the ancient seaport town of Puteoli, once crucial for ships and where Apostle Paul landed on his way to Rome.|"1.

Puteoli, now known as Pozzuoli, was a significant place in ancient times. The group was on their way to see the ruins of the immense amphitheater, but first, they were headed to Solfatara. As the carriage approached Puteoli, they encountered a bridge where many people, including guides and beggars, gathered. The commotion startled Rosie briefly. Rollo selected a boy as their guide, and the carriage moved on, leaving the noisy crowd behind. Eventually, they reached a lane where they had to continue on foot. They entered the crater, a circular valley surrounded by high ridges, with white soil indicating exposure to fire. Inside, an old man demonstrated the hollow ground with a large stone. They proceeded to a spot where dense steam emerged from a cavern, with a roaring sound. After observing the steam and hot earth, they moved on to see an alum manufacturing site within the crater.|"1.

On the shore, there lies a fascinating ruin partially submerged underwater, with columns and structures still visible. Visitors can explore this ancient site using a raised stone pathway provided by the government. Rollo and his group gained entry through a gate guarded by a custodian and walked along the raised path, observing the submerged marble floor and columns of the temple.
