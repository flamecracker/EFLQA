During the early days of Washington's presidency, Congress faced critical decisions that shaped the government's structure. With the treasury empty and debts unpaid, Madison proposed a resolution in the House to establish duties and imposts for revenue. The debate expanded beyond the original plan, focusing on the principles of free commerce and protection of domestic interests. Despite conflicts between members from different regions, the bill passed with moderate duties. The Senate favored commercial treaties with France and Holland over Great Britain, leading to wrangling and close votes. The bill, aimed at balancing revenue needs and protecting domestic industries, became law on July 4. This swift legislative process was marred by concerns that merchants had already increased prices, burdening consumers. The evolving financial measures underscored the need for efficient legislative procedures to benefit the nation's economy.|"1.

During its initial session, Congress drafted amendments to the Constitution to appease those advocating for a bill of rights and to gain acceptance in Rhode Island and North Carolina. Led by Madison, the House proposed seventeen amendments, which were later reduced to twelve by the Senate. Ten of these amendments were ratified, forming the Bill of Rights. The session mainly focused on organizing the new government, as the nation was still recovering from the contentious debate over the Constitution. Fisher Ames observed a group of objectors with mixed motives, including anti-federalists, those influenced by local prejudices, and radical republicans. Elbridge Gerry, an experienced leader, opposed giving heads of departments legislative powers. He advocated for retaining the existing Treasury management system by a Board of Commissioners, as established by the Continental Congress in 1781. Gerry's efforts aimed to maintain stability in the Treasury Department.|"1. What was the main purpose of drafting amendments to the Constitution during the initial session of Congress?

"The discussion went on for a few days, and Madison emerged victorious with a 34 to 20 vote in favor of keeping the clause. However, after further consideration and likely consultation with a small group of wise statesmen, Madison decided it might be risky to have the President's removal power based on a legislative grant that could be revoked. When the House revisited the committee's report, Benson from New York suggested omitting the disputed clause and rephrasing the bill to imply the removal power lay with the President. Madison agreed, and the issue was resolved. The clause passed the Senate due to the Vice-President's tie-breaking vote, and a similar provision was smoothly included in all acts establishing executive departments. Despite some members advocating for limiting the office's existence, the idea was voted down. Fisher Ames made a strong case for keeping the clause, arguing that the Secretary of the Treasury, as the most knowledgeable on finance matters, should provide information to the House openly to ensure transparency and accountability. Sedgwick supported this view, emphasizing the importance of making the officer responsible for the information provided.

During negotiations, Washington's experience with the Senate influenced his behavior. The constitutional convention debates suggested the Senate would advise the President. Washington, focused on duty, sought the Senate's counsel on Indian treaties. He faced reluctance in the Senate, which referred the matter to a committee. The Senate's interference limited the President's appointment powers. Washington's nomination of Benjamin Fishbourn for a position was rejected without clear reasons. Fishbourn, a respected army officer, faced opposition likely due to political scheming. The office went to Lachlan McIntosh, a Georgia politician with a history of conflict. The Senate's role in appointments caused tension with the President. Washington had to accept senatorial decisions, affecting his authority.|"1.

Giles questioned whether the proposed frigates were expected to land and free the prisoners from their chains.

France supported America against England in 1787, aiming to weaken Britain's influence. Despite initial indifference towards America's internal affairs, France sought to convert America into a useful ally during the renewed war with England. While Thomas Jefferson sympathized with the Revolutionary movement, Gouverneur Morris, sympathetic to the King, was chosen as the American Minister. Genet's audacious mission aimed to draw the United States into the war as France's ally and reestablish France's colonial empire, targeting Canada, Louisiana, and the Floridas. The plan involved George Rogers Clark leading Western riflemen against Spanish posts in Louisiana, with expenses to be covered by funds expected from the United States. Treaties between France and the United States granted legal rights, allowing the use of each other's ports and mutual protection at sea. France's past financial support during the Revolution created an expectation for reciprocal support from the United States.|"1.

These details set the stage for Genet's actions. He arrived with a clear purpose to expedite matters, armed with full authority granted by the French government. According to a report from Morris to the State Department, Genet brought 300 blank commissions to distribute to those willing to outfit cruisers in American ports to target British trade. In Charleston, Genet was warmly welcomed, especially by General Moultrie, then governor of South Carolina, who fully supported Genet's initiatives.

"In April 1793, President Washington, known for his careful decision-making, presented his Cabinet with thirteen questions. Thomas Jefferson believed the questions, likely penned by Alexander Hamilton, aimed to declare the US-France treaty void. Hamilton's questions probed whether a proclamation declaring neutrality should be made, and if prior treaties with France were still valid. A Cabinet meeting on April 19 debated issuing a neutrality proclamation. Jefferson felt only Congress could declare war, while Hamilton argued the President had the right to proclaim neutrality. Ultimately, a proclamation prohibiting US citizens from involvement in foreign conflicts was agreed upon, without using the term ""neutrality."" The Cabinet remained divided on treaty obligations, with Jefferson and Hamilton on opposing sides. The Cabinet's decision to issue the proclamation without involving Congress was a compromise."|"1.

A Cabinet meeting on April 19 debated issuing a neutrality proclamation. Jefferson felt only Congress could declare war, while Hamilton argued the President had the right to proclaim neutrality. Ultimately, a proclamation prohibiting US citizens from involvement in foreign conflicts was agreed upon, without using the term ""neutrality."" The Cabinet remained divided on treaty obligations, with Jefferson and Hamilton on opposing sides. The Cabinet's decision to issue the proclamation without involving Congress was a compromise."|"4.

Jefferson faced a challenging situation where he had to uphold a treaty's validity while opposing its obligations. Corresponding with the British Minister, Hammond, Jefferson assured him of America's neutral stance. Despite appearing to balance opposing interests, Jefferson managed the situation skillfully. He shifted blame for national policy weaknesses to Hamilton and his supporters, Randolph and Knox. The political climate was tense, with the public possibly rising against the government. Adams described the chaos incited by Genet in 1793, leading to fears of revolution. Hamilton downplayed the situation, believing only a fraction of the population was involved. Despite personal attacks, Washington remained composed. Jefferson's subordinate, Freneau, used his newspaper to spread anti-administration sentiments. Such actions, now seen as treacherous, were common then. Hamilton also used journalism to defend national rights, influencing public opinion significantly.|"1.

Thomas Jefferson was known for his political skills during elections, but he and his colleagues were no match for Alexander Hamilton in debates. The Jeffersonians blamed Genet for their losses as the issues were deliberated. By July 7, Jefferson expressed to Madison that Genet made his position challenging.

During the late 1700s, the United States faced challenges in securing the navigation rights of the lower Mississippi and establishing boundaries with Spain. Efforts led by Genet to attack Spanish posts were unsuccessful until Thomas Pinckney was appointed as minister plenipotentiary in Spain.

Meanwhile, disputes arose with Great Britain over trade restrictions on American vessels bound for French ports. Despite efforts to maintain friendly relations, British policies caused tensions.

Jay's diplomacy was skillful in handling past differences, but he made a critical mistake in the commercial relations between countries. The treaty aimed for broad trade freedom but had limitations, especially concerning the West Indian trade. American ships faced restrictions, limiting their size and the goods they could transport. Despite these setbacks, the treaty did secure that debts and contracts would be respected during war, a significant step for justice in conflicts. Although unpopular at the time, the treaty's benefits were not immediately recognized. Jay faced intense criticism but remained composed, drawing strength from historical knowledge. The treaty was eventually ratified, with some exceptions, and Jay moved on to serve as governor of New York. Hamilton, on the other hand, resigned from his position due to financial strains and the need to provide for his family, despite his genuine passion for statesmanship.|"1.

Hamilton's success in passing his measures through Congress, despite opposition, intensified the bitterness felt by his rivals. Jefferson and Madison, bound by traditions, maintained public decorum even when privately frustrated. William Branch Giles emerged as a new leader opposing Hamilton, bringing energy and audacity to his legal and political pursuits.

Washington, influenced by Hamilton, faced opposition from Jefferson and Madison, who preferred a less powerful government.

After a series of resolutions were presented on January 23, 1793, demanding detailed accounts of financial transactions from the beginning of the government until the end of 1792, Alexander Hamilton efficiently provided the required information in reports dated February 4, 13, and 14. Subsequently, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, along with others, accused Hamilton of various wrongdoings, leading to a sort of impeachment aimed at forcing him out of the Cabinet. Hamilton defended himself indirectly through a speech delivered by William Smith. Despite the accusations being seen as based on spite rather than substance, the House voted against the resolutions, with only a few supporting Giles, including James Madison. This event marked a significant victory for Hamilton. The political landscape began to shift during the Second Congress, with the formation of national parties, including the Republican Party led by Jefferson, which aimed to counteract perceived monarchical tendencies within the government.|"1.

In a letter dated May 23, 1792, Jefferson accused Hamilton of trying to change the government to a monarchy through his financial policies. Jefferson urged the formation of the Republican party to preserve the current government structure. Washington, after considering Jefferson's arguments, asked Hamilton for a response. Hamilton's defense revealed the practicality of his financial measures in public loans, funding debts, and establishing a national banking system. Despite Jefferson's efforts to discredit Hamilton, Washington remained unswayed. However, Jefferson's tactics led Washington to consider not seeking reelection. An appeal from Edmund Randolph convinced Washington to run again, even though he was reluctant due to his age and declining health. Washington's candidacy made it challenging for the Republican party to gain traction, and Clinton and Washington won most electoral votes.

Giles, after clearing Hamilton of dishonesty accusations, continued to push for more investigation into the Treasury Department. However, he acknowledged that doubts about the Secretary's integrity were dispelled and shifted focus to defining boundaries between the Legislature and the Treasury Department. This new proposal didn't garner much interest from the House or Giles's party. The attempt to discredit Hamilton had failed, leaving only a proposal for further investigation into the Treasury Department's functions. This change didn't bother Hamilton, who had followed existing laws and would soon retire. The House had more pressing matters amidst the country's turmoil over British and French actions.

Washington stated that the government could not passively watch the laws being disregarded. However, there was disagreement within the Cabinet. Randolph believed that calling the militia immediately was unnecessary due to the calm situation, the large number of potential insurgents, and the risk of seeking British aid. He suggested a proclamation and negotiations first. Hamilton, on the other hand, insisted on using a strong militia to suppress the insurrection to maintain the government's existence. The Cabinet, except Randolph, supported Hamilton's plan. Hamilton's strategic approach successfully subdued the insurgents without conflict. The operation was so well managed that even hesitant Pennsylvania complied. The success of Hamilton's operation, though costly, prevented a potential collapse of the government. Randolph's involvement in a questionable financial transaction led to his resignation from the Cabinet.|"1. What was Randolph's main argument against calling the militia immediately?

George Washington's Farewell Address was not directed at Congress but was a public declaration made before the upcoming presidential election. Washington declined to be considered for re-election and instead focused on delivering his traditional address to Congress on December 7, 1796. Despite Congress being ready to respond with warm sentiments, some members like Giles opposed this, criticizing Washington's administration. Giles, supported by a few others including a newcomer, Andrew Jackson, stood firm in his dissent. Over time, Giles regretted his stance, acknowledging his misjudgment. The electoral college system in 1796 led to complexities in the election, with John Adams narrowly winning the presidency over Thomas Pinckney due to strategic voting. This intricate process set the stage for future political conflicts and influenced the course of Adams's administration.|"1. What was the main purpose of George Washington's Farewell Address in 1796?

Adams faced challenges inherited from France's attempts to influence the United States, much like Washington's struggles. Washington hoped Monroe, as the new Minister to France, would improve relations due to his support of the French Revolution. Monroe arrived in Paris after Robespierre's fall, facing hesitation from the Committee of Public Safety.

Pinckney replaced Monroe, but France refused to receive him, suspending diplomatic ties. Adams' handling of the crisis was influenced by his personal traits, causing strained relations with Federalist leaders like Hamilton.

Adams thought sending a dignified mission might make a good impression and asked Jefferson to lead it. Jefferson declined, suggesting Madison instead. Jefferson later reported that Madison also refused. Adams then consulted his Cabinet, now fully Federalist and loyal to Washington and Hamilton. Despite some opposition, the Cabinet eventually supported the mission idea. John Marshall and Elbridge Gerry were appointed alongside Pinckney. Congress backed the firm stance against France, and new laws were enacted for national defense. The extra session ended swiftly due to fears of yellow fever. By the regular session in November, the fate of the mission was still uncertain. Adams sought Cabinet opinions on potential actions, with various proposals presented, including a recommendation for war.|"6.

The suggestions made by McHenry closely resemble those proposed by Hamilton in a letter to Pickering. It is likely that McHenry's ideas were influenced by Hamilton, with the approval of Pickering and Wolcott. McHenry's proposal included granting the President discretionary power to acquire ships of the line, possibly through negotiation with England for cooperation without a formal alliance. This cooperation could involve securing a loan and allowing American ships to join British convoys. However, Pickering informed Hamilton that due to lingering animosities, the plan for cooperation was unfeasible. Meanwhile, the envoys' mission to France revealed the aggressive nature of French policy under the Directory and Napoleon Bonaparte's rising power in Europe. Talleyrand, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, used a mix of threats and flattery towards the envoys to manipulate them. Gerry, one of the envoys, fell into Talleyrand's trap, causing delays in the negotiations. Ultimately, the envoys submitted a detailed report to Congress, known as the X.Y.Z. dispatches, detailing the demands for a bribe from the French officials to establish friendly relations.|"1. What is the main reason behind McHenry's proposal?

"The X.Y.Z. dispatches evoked a surge of patriotic sentiment across the nation, causing turmoil among Republican leaders and prompting some to defect to the Federalist camp. Despite Jefferson's stance against using force to uphold American rights, the Republican party dwindled to a weakened minority. Adams received numerous loyal addresses and the song ""Hail Columbia"" gained immense popularity, celebrating Washington's return to lead the national forces. Congress allocated funds to complete frigates and authorized the formation of additional vessels. The Navy Department was established, and plans were devised to counter French privateers in the West Indies. American sailors demonstrated their prowess, with Captain Truxtun's frigate _Constellation_ achieving notable victories. The conflict saw the capture of numerous French vessels, boosting American trade and revenue.
