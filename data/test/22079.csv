A robust device, like giant shears, hoists the mast and umbrella-shaped antenna on the tractor within about eight minutes. The tractor, with a crew, weighs nearly five tons, making its operation on steep mountain roads challenging and unsafe. They carried a portable radio pack-set for emergencies, generating power by hand-cranking. The journey started smoothly but became difficult on the uneven road with steep inclines. They encountered a large truck on a narrow road, forcing them to reverse back. During this maneuver, the tractor's brakes were crucial for stability. Finally, they reached a hidden spot in the woods, set up a cooking area, and prepared for the night. Snowfall covered the ground as they took turns keeping watch for incoming messages. The next morning, they engaged in a friendly snowball fight, enjoying the wintry weather.|"1. What was the purpose of the portable radio pack-set carried by the crew?
