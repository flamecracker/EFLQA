Despite the howling wind, Diamond found solace in his warm bed, feeling like the happiest boy in the world as he drifted off to sleep.|"1. What did Diamond use to block the wind in his drafty room?

Two people, Durante and a young peasant girl, had unique experiences in a mysterious country. Durante, an Italian noble, described entering through scorching fire, while the young girl fell asleep in a wood and woke there. Durante found a sweet-smelling land with a gentle wind and a river full of flowers. He claimed it always felt like May there. The girl, Kilmeny, spoke of a land without sin, sun, or night. She described a place of love and light, where a river swayed like a living stream. Durante and Kilmeny's accounts aligned, though Kilmeny's lack of experience hindered her description. Another person, Diamond, found himself at the back of the north wind, where the river sang tunes in people's heads.

With the help of nearby stones, Diamond climbed up beside her, feeling her cold bosom warm as she embraced him tightly. Suddenly, she fully awoke, explaining that time inside her realm differs from the outside world. In an instant, Diamond found himself alone as North Wind disappeared. A small insect-like creature circled him, eventually growing into a weasel, then a cat, and further into a jaguar and finally a Bengal tiger.

"Diamond woke up, not from his dream, but within it, hearing a child's voice calling his name, ""Diamond, Diamond!"" Startled, he rose, but everything was quiet around him. The fragrance of the rose bushes filled the air, with the scent resembling the color of the roses, creating a mist that blended with the rosy vapor hanging over the wilderness.

In a grand palace near a magnificent wood, a beautiful baby named Daylight brought joy to the king and queen. Little did they know that a wicked witch disguised as a neighbour lurked in the nearby forest, seeking to cause mischief. Fairies, who traditionally bestowed gifts upon royal babies, were cautious of the witch's presence. At Daylight's christening, the fairies granted her extraordinary gifts, hoping to counteract any harm the witch might intend. Despite the wicked fairy's attempts, history had shown that even her curses could lead to unexpected blessings. Just like the tale of The Sleeping Beauty, where a princess's long slumber protected her until the right prince awakened her, sometimes seemingly unfortunate events could turn out for the best. Fairies, with their inherent powers, always found a way to bring about good in the end.|"1. What was the name of the beautiful baby in the grand palace near the magnificent wood?

For a long time, only a few people witnessed the princess awake. As she grew older, she became a favorite, and some around the palace stayed up at night to be close to her. She often escaped her nurses to enjoy the moonlight alone. This continued until she was nearly seventeen.

She disliked being seen during this time. One summer evening, she vanished and was found asleep in the forest. Near the palace, there was a green glade where she spent most of her time.
