Fred dreamt of recent events: watching for Apaches, the warning by Sut Simpson, the fight, Lone Wolf's capture, the night ride, and the wolf attack.

After carefully surveying his surroundings, the young boy clutched his rifle tightly, half expecting a cougar to attack him. However, all remained quiet, and he cautiously headed eastward, feeling nervous until he was certain no wild animals were watching him. With the dawn, he knew he needed to work seriously.
