"Jane lost some skin from her nose, but she can grow some more, and it will soon be better again. Tommy's reply drew a smile from her friends, but they were too disturbed to feel like laughing. They were also concerned about the suffering horses.

Janus always consulted his whiskers when unsure, finding answers among the graying hairs. The group worked together to lift the horses onto the planks, providing them some relief. As they paused to rest, a faint reddish glow appeared at the end of the bridge, sparking curiosity and wonder among the Meadow-Brook Girls and their companions."|"1.
