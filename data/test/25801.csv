Tory, will you join us? I know I'm selfish, but I hate being away from you. If there's time before Mrs. Phillips comes, why not sketch Lucy again? Your first drawing of her was great, even if you weren't satisfied. Lately, Tory had followed Memory Frean's advice and let the other Girl Scouts help with Kara. They seemed happier together, and Kara felt better for many reasons. At 4 o'clock, Mr. Fenton sent a car to take Kara, Miss Mason, Lucy, and other girls to the site for the Greek pageant. The water was deep, the stream not wide. A clearing with trees nearby was on one side. The open space where they stood was larger. Miss Frean thought it might be the right place, despite being far from Westhaven. They'd need to transport scenery and costumes and arrange seating. But the spot itself was beautiful. They planned to have tableaux across the water and the audience on their side for the illusion. The Palace of Odysseus would be in front of the trees, where most scenes would happen. Odysseus would arrive on a Greek galley, and the maidens would wash clothes by the banks. The players would be hidden until their entrance. Some couldn't see the vision, but Tory could.|"1.

"Dear Tory, did our discovery not disappoint you? Do the letters hold significance for you? Do you believe that something important to you will come from them one day? I trust it if you do.

Beloved Tory, if you, with all your imagination and romantic sensibilities, could not find value in the old letters, why expect a practical, matter-of-fact person like me to do so? The letters seem absurd to me, especially if they are supposed to relate to me.

Please promise not to expect too much or be overly disappointed if things do not turn out as hoped. I am happier today than any letters proclaiming me an heiress could ever make me.

There is nothing more to share, except that I am to go to New York City for treatment and to spend the winter. Mr. Fenton, Mr. Hammond, Dr. McClain, and others have arranged and will cover all my expenses.

Tory, I hope you know that even when I seemed ungrateful, I truly cared for you. I won't dwell on it now, but as an artist, you understand better than I do how one's perspective can be skewed. My view is clearer now, regardless of the outcome.

Kara and Tory spent every spare moment together. In the final days, Miss Victoria Fenton invited Kara to stay with them in the village to make farewells easier. Dr. McClain would accompany Kara to New York for medical consultations, with Mr. Jeremy Hammond"|"1. What is the purpose of the old letters mentioned in the passage?
