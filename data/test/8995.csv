Boarding a late afternoon train to Rouen, they followed a guidebook to a charming hotel, feeling like wise travelers guided by a star.|"1. What did Katy find fascinating in Dieppe?

During their time in the historic city of Rouen, Katy and her companions observed the French manners closely. They marveled at how politely the locals interacted with each other, especially the courteous way they treated service staff. This experience prompted Katy to adopt the same polite behavior, bowing and speaking softly with respectful prefixes. As they explored the city's landmarks like the Cathedral and Palace of Justice, Katy's gracious demeanor influenced Mrs. Ashe and Amy. The guides and locals appreciated their efforts to embrace French civility. Transitioning to modern Paris, the group settled in a pension near the Arc d'Étoile. However, the dampness of the rooms dampened their spirits. The gloomy November weather in Paris, with its fog and wet streets, made exploring the city less enjoyable. Amy's cold confined her indoors, adding to the subdued atmosphere. Despite the challenges, Amy found solace in teaching French to their English maid, Wilkins, who struggled with pronunciation. As they prepared to leave Paris, Katy, although appreciative of some aspects of the city, was ready to move on, feeling that there were more captivating places to explore in Europe.|"1.

"""Why do you think Katy Carr came to Europe?"" Lilly asked, gazing out the window at the three figures strolling along the beach. ""She's the last person I thought would show up here. I thought she was stuck in that awful place... what was it called?... where they live, forever.""

""I wish they were staying somewhere else,"" Lilly sighed. ""If they were at the Rivoir or one of those places at the far end of the beach, we wouldn't have to see them at all. It's annoying to have unexpected visitors, especially relatives. I'm afraid Katy will be hanging around us all the time.""

""Don't worry, we can handle it. We just need to be polite,"" replied Lilly's mother. ""But we must treat her with respect; after all, her father is my cousin.""

""I won't bring her along every time we go out,"" Lilly declared. ""I won't subject Lieutenant Worthington to a country cousin. I won't let her ruin our fun. So, be prepared, Mom, you'll have to figure it out.""

Unaware of the plans to keep her at bay, Katy returned to the hotel feeling content and thoughtful. Finally in Europe, it was living up to her expectations from maps and books, and Nice seemed like the most wonderful place on earth.

Amy, tired of unfamiliar sights and grown-up stories she couldn't grasp, nestled beside Katy on the long wooden settee, pleading for another tale about Violet and Emma. Despite Katy's exhaustion from inventing endless details about the two girls, Amy's appetite for their adventures never waned. Amy even offered to tell Katy a story, but her version lacked excitement, involving mundane activities like having meals and playing. Frustrated, Katy decided to end the tales of Violet and Emma once and for all. She narrated a story where the girls, along with a pony and a basket of goodies, met a tragic end in a snowstorm.

Flower sellers filled the streets, offering fragrant blooms. Katy marveled at the inexpensive flowers, but soon realized they lacked stems and were wired. Beyond the city, she found satisfaction picking roses and wallflowers. Naples, though beautiful, held a sense of danger with whispers of illness.

Little Amy's progress at Albano was impressive. Mrs. Swift closely monitored her like a hawk, ensuring she followed a strict routine. This regimen, along with the fresh air, worked wonders. Amy visibly improved daily, even gaining weight, as noted by her mother. Despite having to share a train compartment with English ladies and Roman Catholic priests on their journey to Florence, Amy's health had improved so much that the trip was manageable. Katy found amusement in observing one of the young priests struggling with his stiff hat throughout the journey. Upon reaching Florence, they found a comfortable apartment and a helpful maid named Maria. Despite Maria's past dreams of becoming an opera singer, she had to settle for being a maid due to her size and slower intellect. Katy admired how quickly people in Europe could create cozy homes, wishing the same could be done in America.|"1. What was Little Amy's progress at Albano like?
