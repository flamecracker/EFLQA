Although the outcome was positive, the rule stands firm. Acting on impulse, whether good or bad, can lead to serious consequences. Seeking advice from trusted friends and family is crucial when facing trouble. Concealment often stems from cowardice, a vice that can be detrimental.

"""I agree, Lucy, and here's why. First, the woman left India shortly after the incident. It's unlikely she saw the children until we returned to England, and there's no evidence she ever saw them again. Even if she did, she couldn't have known which child was which since she never interacted with them. When she saw them in Cheltenham, where Rupert says she stayed over a week, she stared at them but remained uncertain. If we, who have been with the boys for years, couldn't detect a resemblance, it's doubtful she could from brief encounters. The tiny mole on Rupert's shoulder doesn't prove he's our son. Even Edgar's letter confirms she didn't know which boy had the mark. Her motive was likely money, not identifying her son. She couldn't provide evidence of the mark to support her claim, and her actions suggest she was involved in a fraud. Her husband's ignorance of the mark further weakens her case.

The following day, Edgar was officially sworn in. The colonel, after learning that there were no issues with Edgar enlisting, passed him without comment. Edgar was then taken to the tailor to be fitted for his uniform. Shortly after, he was led outside the camp with a few other trumpeters to practice their calls. His duties were demanding, especially when it came to satisfying the riding-master and sergeants during riding practice. Despite the challenges, Edgar's prior experience made it somewhat easier for him. He also spent time practicing the trumpet, doing gymnastics, and attending school daily. In the evenings, he had time to himself to explore the town, relax at the cavalry canteen, or enjoy entertainment.

The unit arrived at Assouan and, the following day, a portion of the group traveled by boat to Wady Halfa, located 180 miles up the river. Edgar's troop was among those who made the journey. They anticipated a larger settlement but found only a few mud huts and unfinished railway sheds. The soldiers engaged in infantry drills and received their gear and saddles before heading to the camel station nearby. The soldiers were entertained by the sight of their camels, gathered from various regions. Adjusting the saddles to fit the camels proved challenging due to the animals' different hump sizes. Mounting and dismounting the camels, which knelt for these actions, was a significant challenge. The soldiers spent days learning to ride the camels, enduring falls that provided amusement to all except the riders. The camels' behaviors, including unexpected leg movements, added to the soldiers' challenges and frustrations.|"1. What did the soldiers find upon reaching Wady Halfa?

On the march, the soldiers obediently followed the halter's guidance, keeping a steady pace without interruption. After a week of training, they grew accustomed to their camels, eagerly awaiting the order to begin. The infantry's boats, crafted in England, were being loaded with provisions and supplies. Despite the challenging journey up the river, the boats were hauled against the strong current by troops and locals. The troopers initially thought the camels had it easier, but their opinions changed as they saw the boats sail swiftly with the wind or rowed laboriously in the sun. The journey from Wady Halfa to Dongola covered 235 miles, with daily marches of about twenty miles. The men bathed in the river and searched for scarce game in the evenings. The rocky, dry terrain made the marches monotonous, but the lush campsite at Korti provided a brief respite before the arrival of more troops.|"1. What were the soldiers following on the march?

The sergeant indicated Edgar's injured left arm. Edgar was surprised when he realized he had been wounded by an Arab while defending himself. The cut on his arm was deep, almost severing a strip of flesh down to his elbow. Edgar bandaged his wound as the sergeant commended him. Thirst was a common affliction among the troops, with many suffering and some even fainting.

Easton believed that Edgar might have been captured by the Arabs rather than killed. He reasoned that Edgar would have known the Arabs were numerous and would have waited for the group to reach the water source.
