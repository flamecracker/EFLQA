Mr. Whitford expressed doubt about the probability of catching the smugglers in the biplane. Tom, confident in his abilities, decided to pursue them. The thrilling chase began with the Falcon tailing the smugglers' craft, which displayed expert maneuvering skills. The two airships soared and swooped through the night sky, engaged in a high-stakes pursuit. Tom Swift faced a critical situation as the gas pressure in the tank soared dangerously. Despite the risk of explosion, Tom refused to abandon the chase. Ned suggested a safer approach, but Tom persisted in trying to fix the issue. With the generator jammed and gas production uncontrollable, the danger escalated. The only secure option was to land and release the gas slowly. However, doing so mid-air posed risks of suffocation.
