"Ned and Tom were heading to their rooms when Ned mentioned a friend who would be pleased to know about Tom's new project. Tom shared that this friend had been on a quirky trip, blessing everything from his luggage to his suspenders. Despite this, Tom looked forward to seeing him again. The next morning, Mr. Baxter's condition did not improve as expected. Though not in immediate danger, the doctor advised a hospital stay due to shock and slow recovery from smoke inhalation. Tom was determined to retrieve secret formulas from Baxter and began working on a chemical fire extinguisher solution. After consulting chemistry books and his father, Tom prepared to test the solution on a bonfire in the meadow.

Tom Swift carefully examined the chemical compound he had created. He ensured it was potent and had set up a strong fire for the test to be challenging. Tom's friends, Ned and Tom, watched eagerly through the smoke as the real test began. Would the fire be extinguished by the chemicals' fumes, or would it persist? The fire initially dwindled after a burst of flames from the bomb, but then unexpectedly reignited. Tom suspected that oil had pooled, causing the resurgence. Quickly, he directed his assistant to drop another bomb, which successfully quenched the flames. Despite the success, Tom sought a faster solution. Mr. Damon arrived just in time to witness the conclusion of the fire test.|"1. What was Tom Swift examining in the text passage?

Tom Swift was extremely occupied over the following days, so much so that even Mary hardly saw him. He spent a lot of time with Mr. Baxter, who seemed to soften his bitterness over losing his formulae as he realized he could assist the young inventor. Mr. Baxter provided valuable suggestions on combining fire-fighting chemicals from his experience with fireworks. He shared how he was deceived by Field and Melling, who took advantage of his association with them to steal his valuable formulae. Despite lacking concrete proof, Tom and Mr. Baxter discussed the possibility of building a case against the deceitful duo with the help of Ned, who had a sharper business acumen.|"1.

Tom and Ned were on their way to Newmarket in a rapid flier to pick up some samples for Tom's new chemical compound. As they flew, Ned noticed a blazing tree in the distance. Curious, they flew closer to investigate. Ned found a metal can in the plane and unscrewed it, releasing a liquid that extinguished the fire when it hit the tree. Tom explained that it was his new aerial extinguisher, a lucky test for his invention. The fire was put out, and they circled back to check. Ned was amazed by the quick and effective result of Tom's invention, which had stopped the fire in its tracks. Tom was proud of his new creation and excited to continue testing it.|"1.

Tom, the young inventor, was determined to perfect his new chemical fire extinguisher. He and Mr. Baxter worked tirelessly to create a compound that could tackle fires effectively. Tom planned to test it first on a pit fire and then on a larger blaze using an airship. Despite his busy days, Tom felt lonely after Mary Nestor's departure. Ned was surprised to learn about high insurance rates due to limited firefighting capabilities in tall buildings. Tom admitted the mistake of not fireproofing the Landmark Building. He worked day and night to prepare for the tests. The first test would be in a pit, and the second, more significant one, would involve setting an old barn ablaze. Mr. Damon agreed to join but didn't want his wife to know about the risky adventure.|"1. What was Tom determined to perfect?

The blaze died down instantly, and the smoke disappeared. The experiment was a success, and the fire was put out effectively. Tom had prepared extra chemicals in case they were needed but didn't have to use them. The group observed the barn, now almost destroyed, with only a few spots still burning.

Tom Swift, the young inventor, had created an aerial fire-fighting machine that dropped powerful chemicals to extinguish fires. As he directed his craft to a small isolated fire in a lumberyard, he tested his new chemical mixture. The first attempt was not successful due to a lack of carbon dioxide. Tom then released a different mixture that effectively subdued the flames. The crowd cheered as they witnessed the success of Tom's invention. The generated gases blanketed the fire, causing it to die down completely. Tom's chemicals were safe for humans and effectively put out the fire without harm. The next day, Tom sought the help of Josephus Baxter, an expert in chemical study, to perfect his fire-fighting invention for skyscrapers.|"1. What did Tom Swift create?

During the war, dropping grenades accurately from a fast-moving airship was a challenge. Aviators had to train extensively to improve their accuracy. To address this issue, Tom Swift invented a machine similar to a range-finder for big guns. This device made it much easier to drop grenades precisely where needed. By considering factors like the airship's speed, height, wind velocity, grenade weight, and more, Tom devised a solution. Setting pointers and levers on a slide rule in the cockpit allowed for precise targeting. Tom prepared the craft with chemical grenades, ensuring everything was in place. As they geared up for their mission, Tom expressed concern for Rad's eyesight. Despite the challenges, Tom was determined to succeed and make those responsible regret their actions.|"1.
