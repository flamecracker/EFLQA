Children form moral habits not just by hearing or seeing but through action that stems from feelings. Edward Thring emphasizes that bravery and truth are nurtured through experience, not just instruction. Knowledge must be coupled with the ability to use it effectively to hold value. Reading should be both extensive and engaging for children, focusing on quality literature that resonates with them. The books a child reads in solitude shape their character more than those read in public. Encouraging ownership of books, maintaining a home library, and introducing children to classics like Aesop's Fables and Robinson Crusoe at a young age is crucial. Vacation time should also be utilized for reading and learning about authors' lives to deepen understanding and appreciation for literature. The perseverance and dedication of great minds, like Longfellow or Lowell, serve as invaluable lessons for children. Exposure to poetry enhances children's imagination and curiosity, even if they don't fully grasp the content. Stimulating curiosity through challenging ideas can benefit a child's development according to Sir Walter Scott.|"1. What does Edward Thring emphasize about forming moral habits in children?
