Our first mate shared an incredible tale of a daring escape in the Greenland Sea Fishery. A whale was struck, and as they rowed hard to reach it again, the harpooner swiftly pierced the blubber. The whale, in agony, raised its tail high, about to strike. The harpooner's quick dive into the water saved his life as the whale's flukes sliced the boat in two. Thankfully, all were rescued. The crew then worked swiftly to hoist the whale aboard. The blubber, fins, and jaw were carefully extracted. The whale's unique mouth, filled with whalebone, filters its food of small sea creatures. The blubber was meticulously cut and stored, with the captain estimating a hefty profit from the fat whale.|"1.

During the voyage, my messmate, Tom Lokins, often talked about the sea-birds that accompany whalers. I was amazed when I saw an enormous albatross, the largest flying bird, glide towards us. Soon, other birds like gonies, stinkards, and petrels joined, feeding greedily on the whale's carcass. Sharks also appeared, not just scavenging but boldly biting into the whale. These sharks, with rows of sharp teeth, were fearless. Tom, determined to retaliate against a shark, called for help to catch it. Even after cutting its tail and removing its entrails, the shark continued to thrash about the deck. Witnessing this struggle, I realized the resilience of these creatures. Eventually, after the whale was stripped of its blubber, it was released into the sea, sinking to the delight of the sharks and the disappointment of the smaller birds.|"1.

Hope arose seeing it burn, but as it went astern, despair set in. I remembered my mother's advice to pray in trouble and did so earnestly. I prayed for my friend's safety.

Whales and fish have many differences. Whales are warm-blooded, while fish are cold-blooded. Whales give birth to live young, while most fish lay eggs. Whales breathe air through lungs, not gills, and must surface to breathe. They discharge water mixed with air through their blowholes when they come up to breathe. A remarkable difference is that whales suckle their young. A whale calf is born about fourteen feet long and weighs about a ton. The cow-whale shows affection and anxiety towards its calf. Whales, unlike heartless fish, care for their offspring. Whales have been observed protecting their young, even when in danger. There are various types of whales, with the common right whale and the sperm whale being the most sought after. The sperm whale is known for its large teeth and blunt head, which can be one-third of its body length. It feeds on cuttle-fish and can be fierce when provoked, sometimes attacking boats. Fighting-whales, especially old bulls, can be a challenge for whalers due to their strength and aggression.|"1. What is a major difference between whales and fish according to the text?

It is rare for a sperm whale to attack a ship, but there are documented cases of such encounters. One such incident involved the American whaleship _Essex_ in 1819. While hunting sperm whales in the South Pacific, the crew faced a colossal whale that struck the ship, causing it to sink. The men took to their boats, and the whale, seemingly injured, circled back and rammed the ship, leading to its demise. The crew, left stranded in open boats, endured extreme hardships. Some perished, while others reached a desolate island. A few chose to stay behind, hoping for rescue, while the rest embarked on a perilous journey towards Juan Fernandez. Only five out of the twenty men survived this harrowing ordeal, with some resorting to cannibalism to stay alive.|"1. What is the main topic of the text?

"Before continuing my story, I want to mention a significant detail about sperm whales. Inside the head of a sperm whale, there is a large hole known as the ""case"" that holds pure oil called spermaceti. This oil doesn't need to be melted and can be easily stored in casks. Spermaceti is valuable and used to make high-quality candles. A single whale can provide around fifteen barrels of spermaceti oil from its head. Larger whales can yield up to a hundred barrels of oil. Whales are not naturally aggressive; in fact, they tend to avoid fights. The ""right"" whale is timid and only fights to protect its young. When hunted, sperm whales usually flee. They have three main enemies: the swordfish, the thrasher, and the killer whale. The swordfish attacks by stabbing the whale with its horn, while the thrasher leaps onto the whale's back and strikes it with its tail. The killer whale is the most dangerous, as it is swift and strong, capable of overpowering even large whales."|"1. What is the purpose of the ""case"" inside the head of a sperm whale?

Fred Borders, a knowledgeable and observant shipmate, shared an intriguing story with his fellow sailors. He recounted an incident involving a young doctor on their voyage to the Greenland Seas. The doctor was curious about the green tint of the sea in certain areas and embarked on a study. He collected sea-water, examined it closely, and discovered an astonishing fact. In every square mile of sea-water, there existed an unimaginable number of tiny creatures. The doctor calculated that there were approximately eleven quadrillions, nine hundred and ninety-nine trillions of these creatures in each square mile. To put this vast number into perspective, he explained that it would take forty thousand men counting continuously to reach this staggering figure.

"Tom Lokins, a seasoned sailor, explained to Fred that calculating big numbers required months of hard work. However, Fred disagreed, recalling advice from a clergyman who claimed it could be done in just half an hour with good arithmetic skills. Suddenly, a massive whale appeared, and the crew sprang into action, launching boats to pursue it. As they rowed, smaller whales surrounded them, oblivious to the danger. The crew focused on the colossal whale, believed to be the infamous ""New Zealand Tom."" With adrenaline pumping, they maneuvered their boat close to the whale. The captain commanded them to back away just in time to avoid the whale's powerful tail. The crew watched in awe as the wounded whale thrashed in the water, turning the sea red with blood."|"1.

Suddenly, everything stopped. Before we could even react, the whale dove deep, pulling the line so fast that the boat spun and sparks flew. The captain yelled, and we raced across the sea, foam towering ahead. Other whales surfaced nearby. As we neared the first mate's boat, we saw he was busy with a catch. The line slackened, and we reeled it in as the captain readied his lance. The whale resurfaced, and we rowed towards it. Instead of fleeing, it charged us. I feared the worst as it bore down on us, but the captain's skill saved us. We struggled with the whale, but it was cunning, evading us. Finally, the captain struck a fatal blow. The whale bled, a sign of its defeat, but it fought on. As the line pulled taut, chaos ensued. I was thrown overboard, sinking fast. Amid the turmoil, thoughts of life and eternity raced through my mind until, miraculously, I surfaced, gasping for air.|"1. What happened when the whale dove deep?

Our voyage had been successful until tragedy struck on a calm Sunday morning. While chatting with the first mate, a seasoned but gruff man, we lost a crew member. Whaling life is filled with risks, and we had already faced challenges like losing fish and equipment. But this loss was different. The first mate, a Yankee who valued everything in dollars, recounted a harrowing experience in the Greenland Seas. They had a relentless encounter with a massive whale that towed them for over thirty-six hours, defying all attempts to stop it. The crew's resilience was tested as they battled the beast, finally prevailing after forty hours of intense struggle. This tale of perseverance and loss serves as a reminder of the dangers and uncertainties of life at sea.|"1. What was the main cause of tragedy on the calm Sunday morning?

Some of my crewmates questioned the tale, but I trusted it. The mate, though stern, was honest. A similar event occurred aboard the _Royal Bounty_ in 1817. I understand these stories may seem unbelievable, but those who've ventured to the whale-fishery know their truth. Captain Scoresby's accounts are as astonishing as mine. Once, a whale in Greenland pulled over six miles of line. During a whale hunt, a large sperm whale surfaced near us. We engaged in a fierce battle, harpooning the whale repeatedly. When the whale finally dived, it resurfaced under the captain's boat, causing chaos. Many were injured, with one man's leg broken.
