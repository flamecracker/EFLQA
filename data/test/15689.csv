During the examination, Captain Montague was very strict, even though his suspicions about Gascoyne had lessened due to his honesty and the reasonable explanations he provided. After inspecting the ship and papers, Montague found nothing to suggest that the Foam was anything but an honest trader. Gascoyne pointed out the differences between his ship and the pirate vessel, including the color scheme and figurehead. Despite being somewhat embarrassed, Montague acknowledged the distinctions. As they parted ways, Montague noticed a peculiar signal and had to cut his visit short. Later, when the crew was mustered, Montague singled out surly Dick and ordered him into a boat. Gascoyne was displeased, but bid Dick farewell warmly. As the boat rowed away, Dick suddenly claimed that the schooner was a pirate, causing tension among the crew. The next morning at Sandy Cove, the settlement was peaceful, with nature undisturbed by the impending conflict. Despite the quiet, preparations for a potential attack were underway. The British frigate and the Foam showed no signs of readiness, but the calm was merely a facade before the storm. Men were either preparing for battle or waiting for it with resolve. On the frigate, Montague was informed of the imminent attack by savages, and the crew stood ready for action. In the village, both white men and native converts were armed and prepared to defend against the threat.|"1. What did Gascoyne do to prove the Foam was an honest trader?

He believed her innocence could shield them from evil. Bumpus, less convinced, battled his fears. He clenched his fists, ready to fight. Armed with a broken saber and a pistol, Corrie followed cautiously. Poopy, trembling, clung to Corrie, her love for Alice keeping her from fleeing. As they ventured deeper, their hearts raced, listening intently. Nearby, a group of savages, drawn by the commotion, gathered outside the cave. Meanwhile, Keona, a sinister captor, placed Alice on a precarious ledge, leaving her terrified. Back in the cave, Keona, grinning wickedly, prepared to confront his pursuers.

As the native fled, Jo emerged, ready to capture him. However, the savages recognized Jo and captured Poopy. Bumpus and Corrie then sprang into action.

It was strange that Poopy did not cry more when she was mistreated, as she had endured similar abuse from her stepmother before. Despite receiving a slap, she pretended to be humble but was actually seething inside. As the debate dragged on into the early hours of the morning, it was decided to take them to their village for further judgment. While Corrie and his friend were easily carried, Bumpus put up a fierce struggle and was struck on the head, causing a commotion. As they traversed the mountainous terrain, they eventually reached the cliffs by the sea. Bumpus, regaining his strength, broke free from his restraints, leading to a dangerous confrontation. In a shocking turn of events, he was thrown off the cliff by the savages.

Bumpus bowed his head briefly. The harsh truth hit him hard. Yet, he didn't cower in fear. The looming threat of death didn't shake him, a true sailor. Instead, he brimmed with noble anger at the injustice. His temples burned with emotion, and like a tiger, he broke free from the jailer's grip, knocking him down. With a strength akin to Samson, he fought his restraints briefly, but they held firm. Overpowered by six guards, Bumpus didn't give up. He struggled valiantly until they led him to the chosen hanging tree, surrounded by a crowd. The Widow Stuart, knowing his innocence, pleaded desperately but in vain. Some settlers felt uneasy, wanting to wash their hands of the affair, while others, seeing Bumpus's true character, urged for a delay. Ultimately, the influential few who sought justice for what they believed was a pirate's crime prevailed.

In his final moments, Bumpus asked for a letter to be returned to Susan, regretting not heeding her warning about sandalwood traders. He sought a kind soul to deliver it, along with a lock of his hair, as a final gesture of love and regret.|"1. What was Bumpus's reaction to the looming threat of death?
