Nyoda requested me to write about our memorable car trip last September. She believed it was too good to keep to ourselves, especially since I was the official reporter for the Winnebagos. Sahwah wished for a ride in a patrol wagon to add some thrill, but our adventures were sparked by a simple event - the popularity of tan khaki outfits. While watching the stars, thoughts of Evangeline's lost love crossed my mind, pondering if two souls could just miss each other. As I observed two girls playfully chasing each other, I got engrossed in their game, waiting to see who would win. Fate seemed to listen to my musings, hinting at more adventures on the horizon. When Gladys's father allowed us to plan a trip within a 500-mile radius, he challenged us to be self-reliant, testing our resourcefulness. Gladys's father teased her about needing help, but she was confident with Nyoda's experience. If we completed the trip without seeking aid, he promised to build us a permanent Lodge for our Winnebago meetings. Gladys was thrilled by the prospect of a new Lodge.|"1.

The chance of rain had never crossed our minds, envisioning only sunny country roads. However, Gladys mocked the idea of letting a little rain deter the Camp Fire Girls.

We returned to the small eatery where we had our morning meal and ordered dinner. The options were boiled fish or fried steak, and all of us except Margery chose steak. The heat had reduced our hunger, but Margery enjoyed her fish. After dining, we ventured back into the sweltering weather. Yearning for relief, we checked if the cinema was open. Thankfully, it was, and we entered, relieved. During the movie, Sahwah nudged me, pointing out the Frog on one side, while Nakwisi discreetly drew my attention to the motorcyclist on the other. Later, as we left to fetch the Glow-worm, Margery felt unwell under the scorching sun. Unable to find a room due to a local event, we sought help from a nearby woman. Margery's condition worsened, and a doctor diagnosed her with food poisoning from the fish eaten in the heat. Thankful for choosing steak, we cared for Margery as the doctor treated her.|"1.

We gazed at each other in confusion. How did Gladys end up in Indianapolis? The city was far from our intended route, miles to the south. It seemed impossible for her to have gotten lost with the clear road markings. But if Gladys had taken a detour and fallen behind us, who had passed ahead of us along the northern route to Chicago, the path we blindly followed? How did Gladys in Indianapolis receive the telegram we sent to Chicago, providing our address in Rochester? If Gladys hadn't taken the northern route, how did her trunk end up in Wellsville? It was a perplexing puzzle no matter how we analyzed it. We eagerly anticipated noon when the mystery would unravel. To pass the time, we explored the local stores, marveling at the variety of goods from handkerchiefs to farm tools, creating a stir among the locals. The store owner's suspicious behavior added to the intrigue, leaving us wondering about the mysteries surrounding us.|"1. How did Gladys end up in Indianapolis?

Everywhere we turned, we faced a wall of mystery. Was the Frog behind it? Why did he linger in the shadows, not openly confronting us? His silent presence was more unsettling than an armed highwayman. Though he hadn't shown up yet today, we sensed his lurking presence. As we waited, a motorcyclist approached. Longing for noon when Gladys would arrive, we endured the oppressive town. Passing time in a store, we were shadowed by the owner, relieved when we left. Frustrated, we returned to Margery, waiting for the Striped Beetle. Hours passed, the sun scorching as we sang to distract ourselves. Tourists passed, but not our awaited friends. Nyoda found a strange beetle in her pocket, leaving us speechless. The day dragged on, our anticipation turning to disappointment as we watched and waited in vain.|"1.

Nyoda tried to remember where she had been all day. She and Sahwah were at the restaurant, and no one else was nearby. Nyoda was puzzled because the scarab she found wasn't from their town; it must have come from a city or a collector. They went to the police station, but the officer told them to take the scarab elsewhere because of a strange incident with a necklace. Nyoda suggested they head towards Indianapolis to find their missing friends. Sahwah found it odd that Gladys didn't send another message when she couldn't make it. Nyoda worried that something bad had happened to their friends. They decided to search for them, fearing the worst.|"1. What puzzled Nyoda in the text passage?

Sahwah suggested that maybe the wire got misplaced, so Nyoda and I rushed to the telegraph office to check for any new messages. Unfortunately, there were none. Nyoda quickly decided to head towards Indianapolis, but left instructions for any messages to be forwarded to Kokomo. We all hopped into the Glow-worm, picked up Margery, and left Rochester behind, covered in thick dust. The scorching heat made us seek relief in the car, despite the swirling dust. We kept a watchful eye on Margery, worried about the intense heat. We stopped at various places, asking about a brown car with black stripes carrying four girls in tan suits, but found no trace. Our search felt like looking for a needle in a haystack, with the added challenge of a moving target. We even had a moment of panic when we heard about a similar car accident, but thankfully, it wasn't the one we were looking for.|"1. What did Sahwah suggest might have happened with the wire?

After a long search for Gladys, we found ourselves stranded on the road without gasoline for our car. A sudden storm hit us, drenching us instantly. Seeking refuge under a tree, lightning struck nearby, making us flee to safety. A kind driver in a limousine offered us help, his demeanor changing upon seeing a scarab we possessed. He quickly towed our car to his grand mansion in the countryside. The chauffeur, nicknamed Heinie, assured us of refueling the car while a maid welcomed us inside the vast estate. The chauffeur's unique baseball finger caught our attention as he skillfully maneuvered the car towards the garage, leaving us in awe of the unexpected turn of events.|"1.
