Two months passed before the lugger returned to Poole, carrying the squire and Polly, who had been warmly invited by Monsieur Martin to visit Patsey at her new home. Patsey was delighted to be in Nantes, living in a charming house in Monsieur Martin's garden. She had her own servant and enjoyed the privacy of her separate abode while also being close to her husband's family. Patsey spent time with Jean's mother and sister when he was away, and Leigh, who was learning business habits, kept her company in the evenings. The squire and Polly stayed with Monsieur Martin, and Patsey's progress in learning French with Jean's family was evident. Jean's absences were short, and he often took Patsey to his estate in the Bocage, a rustic region with unique customs that fascinated her. Patsey appreciated the simplicity and warmth of life in the countryside, contrasting it with the formality of city living.|"6. Who kept Patsey company in the evenings during Jean's absences?

B) Monsieur Martin

During the first eighteen months of Patsey's marriage, everything was peaceful. She learned to speak French fluently and could communicate in the local dialect after staying at the country chateau. Leigh, her husband, was adept in both French and English. He often sailed to various French towns and ports, growing stronger and more active. He got along well with Monsieur Martin but avoided his eldest son due to personal dislike. Jacques Martin, Leigh’s brother-in-law, was a stark contrast. Methodical and opinionated, he followed Voltaire and Rousseau, causing tension in the family due to his radical views. Leigh asked Jacques about the commotion at the wharf, and Jacques explained the unrest in France due to heavy taxation and royal extravagance. The nobles had immense power, unlike in England, where they interacted with and cared for their people. The tension in France stemmed from writers like Voltaire and Rousseau who criticized the church and institutions, leading to a loss of faith among the people.|"1.

Jean Martin had come back home. Two days later, he gathered all the tenants on the estate to talk about the importance of having some discipline. He brought a wagon full of muskets and ammunition found at Chollet after most peasants had left. Cathelineau allowed him to take them to arm the peasants near the chateau for the upcoming battle. The peasants took the firearms gladly but refused to fight in any organized way. Leigh, having fought at Chollet and being related to the seigneur, convinced about twenty boys to follow him. The generals chose officers based on qualities like energy and position, not rank. Leigh persuaded the boys to be scouts, reporting enemy movements and carrying out small operations instead of joining the main fight. He explained that quickness, alertness, and watchfulness were more important than size and strength in war.|"1. What did Jean Martin bring to the estate to arm the peasants?

Three hours after reaching the river, Leigh spotted a group of horsemen descending the slope. He held his fire until they reached the broken bridge, then signaled his men hidden in the greenery to open fire. The enemy suffered heavy losses and retreated, mocked by the peasants.

The enemy fled in panic as the peasants pursued them, inflicting heavy casualties. The defenders regrouped, maintaining their position and exchanging fire with the enemy across the river. Despite heavy artillery fire, the defenders held their ground, inflicting significant losses on the enemy.

For now, yes. I wish that the Count de Lescure will join us in a day or two. He will be one of our leaders. He has much power with the country people, and if he can convince them to stay ready for a while, we will attack the enemy. Some of us believe that to win in the end, we must be on the offensive, marching towards Paris. We think we should get Monsieur Charette to come with us, cross the Loire, wake up all of Brittany, and then march, a hundred thousand strong, towards Paris. They say that even though we have been successful so far, the enemy will return with more troops until they defeat us. If Monsieur de Lescure and Henri de la Rochejaquelein help us, we might persuade the peasants that it's better to make one big effort and finish it, rather than being constantly called away from their homes whenever the enemy attacks. We will also tell them that after their two defeats, the enemy will become more aggressive, and that they have been ordered to destroy all villages and cut down all hedges and woods. Once our plans are set, I will send a message to you. Right now, there's no need for you or your scouts, Monsieur Stansfield. They deserve a break after their good service.

There have been significant changes in this town recently. A year ago, many believed that the Assembly would bring about positive changes, promising better living conditions for everyone. However, as more and more people were arrested and executed, including ordinary citizens like tradesmen and doctors, the mood shifted.

The town is now under strict control, with spies everywhere, making it dangerous to speak against the government. The situation is tense, with even moderate voices facing suspicion. Disguised as fishermen, two individuals seek to escape the oppressive regime by living on a boat, hidden from prying eyes. They plan to navigate the river, occasionally fishing, while avoiding the authorities.|"1. What was the initial belief about the Assembly's impact on the town?

I wasted no time. I am certain that it will take an hour before anyone joins me; they all love to hear themselves talk too much to end a discussion in less than an hour after the speaker sits down. I hope the boat is nearby because my bag is heavy. It's actually heavier than I thought. I packed everything I didn't want to leave behind until it was full. When I locked it and tried to lift it, I was shocked by the weight. I rang for her and said I was going out, not planning to return until late.

He had been living in fear and was falling out of favor with the people he knew. He had thought of escaping before but didn't know how. He felt like a boy afraid to jump into the water until someone pushed him in, and he realized it wasn't so bad. He felt free and lighthearted like a boy.

She could go to bed whenever she wanted, which I knew would be soon. I was worried someone might recognize me, but luckily, I didn't see anyone.

After the army's capture of Saumur, had they advanced into Brittany, the peasants would have risen up. However, as fugitives, they were more a caution than a cause of excitement. Jean Martin, his wife, and Leigh discussed their situation. La Rochejaquelein was elected commander-in-chief after Bonchamp's death. D'Elbee was left wounded at a Breton peasant's cottage. They knew their only hope was a British force landing to help them. Unfortunately, England was unaware of the crisis. The Revolution was seen as a result of years of oppression, and a powerful group in England supported it. If England had sent troops to Brittany or La Vendee, Europe's fate would have changed. France's Revolution could have been stopped, saving lives and money. The people of La Vendee bravely fought against France. England's inaction led to the near destruction of the Vendee peasants.

Their best chance was to march to Laval and prepare for battle.|"1. What was the main reason why the peasants did not rise up when the army captured Saumur?

For our safety, we plan to travel across the Loir between Chateaudun and Nogent, then head south via Fontainebleau through Montargis.
