Passage|Question|Answer|Model_Response
This collection of animal tales for kids aged three to eight recounts the escapades of woodland and field creatures in a delightful manner that captivates young readers. Among the farm animals, some felt envious of the Muley Cow, a favorite of Johnnie Green. The neighboring red cow often grumbled about the treats Johnnie spoiled the Muley Cow with, like potatoes, apples, and carrots. The other cow, a white one, also yearned for these goodies. Despite their jealousy, they treated the Muley Cow respectfully since she was the oldest and an aunt to them. Johnnie displayed his fondness by feeding her treats and grooming her, much like he did with the elderly horse, Ebenezer. The Muley Cow cherished these gestures, especially during winter when she was confined in the barn. In contrast, during summer in the pasture, she could groom herself with her long tongue or seek assistance from distant barn companions to avoid their snide comments. Johnnie's attachment to the Muley Cow stemmed from her being a gift from Farmer Green, though the Muley Cow humorously claimed that Johnnie belonged to her.|"1.

Johnnie Green discovered that owning a cow wasn't all fun. Sometimes he wished his father or the hired man could milk the cow, especially when friends came by or he had to run errands.
