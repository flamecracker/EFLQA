The storm arrived from the Sunda Straits, where the captain and his son had been discussing. They had to scud before it with almost bare poles. Throughout the night, it raged, growing more intense towards morning. A back-stay of the foremast broke, causing additional strain on the other stays, leading to their parting. The fore-top-mast snapped off, taking the main-topgallant-mast with it. After the havoc, the storm began to calm, reduced to a stiff breeze at sunrise. Nigel Roy, the amateur first mate, energetically helped secure everything. His father, the captain, took a practical view of the situation, emphasizing that what seems bad may turn out good. The captain then shared the tale of the Keelin' Islands, volcanic with a coral top-dressing, once uninhabited until claimed by a Scotsman named Ross.|"1.

Around midnight on the 28th, a fierce gale struck the island. The darkness was thick between lightning flashes, and the roaring wind nearly drowned out the thunder. To survive, people had to hide in ditches and hollows. Mr. Ross and his group sought shelter near a wall. Suddenly, a schooner approached on a massive wave, heading straight for them. Mr. Ross shouted a warning, and they clung to the wall as the wave crashed over, destroying his house but sparing the wall. The schooner got stuck just before reaching them. Despite the devastation, the islanders survived the cyclone seven years ago and are now thriving. As night fell, the gale calmed, allowing them to navigate to the calm lagoon inside the reef. Nigel Roy observed the phosphorescent fish and coral life with great interest. The calm lake was surrounded by a coral reef, with islets and vegetation scattered within. They were warmly welcomed by Mr. Ross, the governor of the Cocos Islands, and offered resources to repair their ship, the _Sunshine_. Captain Roy only requested a stick to rig a foretop-mast to sail to Batavia for repairs. The islanders, skilled sailors, lived in well-furnished cottages with boats at the water's edge. Nigel was charmed by their innocence and kindness.|"1. What did Mr. Ross and his group do to survive the fierce gale on the island?

Around midnight on the 28th, a fierce gale struck the island. The darkness was thick between lightning flashes, and the roaring wind nearly drowned out the thunder. To survive, people had to hide in ditches and hollows. Mr. Ross and his group sought shelter near a wall. Suddenly, a schooner approached on a massive wave, heading straight for them. Mr. Ross shouted a warning, and they clung to the wall as the wave crashed over, destroying his house but sparing the wall. The schooner got stuck just before reaching them. Despite the devastation, the islanders survived the cyclone seven years ago and are now thriving. As night fell, the gale calmed, allowing them to navigate to the calm lagoon inside the reef. Nigel Roy observed the phosphorescent fish and coral life with great interest. The calm lake was surrounded by a coral reef, with islets and vegetation scattered within. They were warmly welcomed by Mr. Ross, the governor of the Cocos Islands, and offered resources to repair their ship, the _Sunshine_. Captain Roy only requested a stick to rig a foretop-mast to sail to Batavia for repairs. The islanders, skilled sailors, lived in well-furnished cottages with boats at the water's edge. Nigel was charmed by their innocence and kindness.|"5. How did Nigel Roy feel about the islanders he encountered?
A) Annoyed by their innocence
B) Impressed by their sailing skills
C) Scared of their kindness
D) Indifferent to their hospitality
E) Suspicious of their intentions"|B) Impressed by their sailing skills|Yes

Returning to the cave, they found that the active man had finished his morning meal, washed the dishes, and tidied up the kitchen. He was ready with a bag and a gun when his master asked him to prepare for a day in the forest. Instead of following them, we turn to matters of more interest at the moment. After a delightful day exploring the lush tropical vegetation on the island, visiting an extinct crater, bathing in hot springs, and collecting botanical and geological specimens, they returned to the cave-house eager for food and rest. The cave was dark when they entered, but Moses lit a lamp, illuminating the space. They had supper and then became a bit more sociable. Nigel was shown his sleeping spot in a recess with a blanket. As he lay down, he observed his host and Moses engaged in conversation, which kept him awake for a while. Eventually, he fell into a deep slumber but was abruptly awakened by strange sensations and sounds, leading to a restless night.|"1. What did the active man do after finishing his morning meal?

The hermit and his companions observed the volcano, Krakatoa, which they initially thought was dormant but turned out to be moderately active. The cone of Perboewatan was visibly erupting with molten lava, rocks, and smoke. The hermit explained that although Rakata, the highest cone, was distant from the main activity, the volcanic energy might seek other vents first. The explosions were intense, with rocks hurtling through the air and lightning flashing around the vapour-column. Fine white dust covered the island, and pumice floated into the Indian Ocean. Despite scientists describing the eruption as moderately violent, to the observers, it seemed far more severe. The hermit reassured them that the explosions were decreasing, but Nigel felt it was safer to leave the island while the volcano was active. The hermit prepared to depart, and Nigel, eager for adventure, was ready to follow, despite the potential risks.|"1. What did the hermit and his companions observe at the volcano, Krakatoa?

A steamboat was prepared for a sightseeing trip on the morning of May 26th. Captain David Roy, accompanied by a group of tourists, decided to visit a volcano out of curiosity. The group arrived at the eruption site on May 27th after witnessing explosions and earthquakes the night before. They observed the aftermath of the eruption with white dust covering the islands. The party identified Perboewatan as the active volcano and approached it on the steamboat. Explosions occurred at regular intervals, and the steam-cloud lit up with a fiery glow each time. The merchant shared experiences of volcanic activities from other places. Captain Roy realized finding his son on the island would be challenging due to dense forests and decided to continue the ascent with the group. Later, Nigel and the hermit arrived at the volcano, witnessing the immense crater and the deafening roar of the eruption.|"1. What was the reason for the sightseeing trip on May 26th?

The loud explosions and crackling rocks meeting in the air, alongside the bubbling lava, created a scene that resembled the very depths of hell. Nigel, lost in the spectacle, was jolted back to reality by Moses, pointing out other visitors nearby. As Nigel observed them, a nautical man appeared, equally mesmerized by the volcanic display. After a moment of mutual shock, they exchanged warm greetings, momentarily halting a photographer setting up to capture the scene. Despite the awe-inspiring power of nature, science's influence was evident as the photographer prepared to capture the volcano on film. Nigel's father bid farewell, cautioning his son about the potential dangers of living near such active volcanoes.

The hermit explained the canoe's unique features to Nigel. The deck had watertight boxes to keep water out, and a pump to handle any leaks. The hermit showed Nigel a narrow box under the deck with useful tools and a small mast with a sail. The hermit paddled with a double-bladed paddle, while Moses used a single blade. Spinkie, the monkey, joined them on the deck. As they glided over the water, the hermit assured Nigel that Spinkie could take care of himself. With powerful strokes, they set off eastward, benefiting from the canoe's design and their strength. They soon left the land behind and marveled at the sunrise over the sea. Nigel pondered the purpose of their journey and the hermit's mysterious background. The group passed through the Sunda Straits and entered the island-filled archipelago. Moses shared baked bird with Nigel, but Spinkie eagerly grabbed the food, causing a silent laugh from Moses.|"1. What did the deck of the canoe have to keep water out?

"""I have an ambition to shoot a tiger,"" Nigel told Van der Kemp one evening. Nigel wanted to know if people would mind if he climbed a tree with his rifle to watch over the grave at night.

He observed the surroundings, adjusted the rifle, and waited for darkness. As night fell, Nigel felt eerie and saw movement near the grave. He thought it might be a tiger but dismissed the idea. He felt uncomfortable, thinking of ghosts, although he didn't believe in them. A mournful wail broke the silence, making Nigel shiver. Eventually, he realized it was a mourning ritual.

Warm pumice rained down on the deck, causing no harm due to its light nature. The sky lit up with lightning, painting the clouds as if they were a massive pine-tree. Kathleen found the spectacle splendid, unfazed by the danger. Mud rain fell on the deck, followed by iron cinders. Explosions continued through the night, with the sky alternating between darkness and light. The Krakatoa volcano, close to sea-level, had its safety valves blown away, allowing the sea to rush in and trigger grand explosions.|"1.

"During the tense moments that followed, the hermit returned to Winnie and Nigel on the quarter-deck. He spoke quietly with Nigel while drawing Winnie close with a reassuring arm. Captain Roy took hold of the wheel, and the crew stood ready at their posts for any action required.

""Wait for orders before acting, no matter what occurs,"" Captain Roy commanded in a commanding voice that carried across the ship, even through the storm and the volcanic activity. A sense of impending disaster hung over everyone.

""Winnie, my dear,"" the hermit said gently, leaning down to look at her face. ""I fear another explosion is imminent, but take solace in knowing that no harm will come without His permission. He will guide us.""

Suddenly, a deafening crash and a massive eruption of smoke, fire, and lava shook the ship. Witnesses described the terrifying spectacle as the volcano unleashed its full fury. The eruption obliterated two-thirds of the island, claiming thousands of lives.

As a colossal wave approached in the darkness, the crew braced for impact. Their only chance was to ride the wave stern first, hoping to avoid being capsized. The captain steered the ship, preparing for the inevitable collision with the monstrous wave."|"1. What did the hermit do when he returned to Winnie and Nigel on the quarter-deck?

""Wait for orders before acting, no matter what occurs,"" Captain Roy commanded in a commanding voice that carried across the ship, even through the storm and the volcanic activity. A sense of impending disaster hung over everyone.

""Winnie, my dear,"" the hermit said gently, leaning down to look at her face. ""I fear another explosion is imminent, but take solace in knowing that no harm will come without His permission. He will guide us.""

Suddenly, a deafening crash and a massive eruption of smoke, fire, and lava shook the ship. Witnesses described the terrifying spectacle as the volcano unleashed its full fury. The eruption obliterated two-thirds of the island, claiming thousands of lives.

As a colossal wave approached in the darkness, the crew braced for impact. Their only chance was to ride the wave stern first, hoping to avoid being capsized. The captain steered the ship, preparing for the inevitable collision with the monstrous wave."|"2. How did Captain Roy instruct the crew to act during the tense moments?

On went the boat _Sunshine_, amid chaos and destruction, on its peculiar journey across land and sea until a sudden halt was felt. It wasn't the anticipated crash or an abrupt stop. Initially, there was a hissing and scraping noise against the boat's sides, followed by a gradual slowdown that strained the rigging. Back-stays snapped, the foretopsail ripped with a loud bang, and then a deafening tearing sound signified the loss of both masts. Despite the relative calm that followed, water still surged beneath them, the wind blew strangely, and unfamiliar scents filled the air. The people of Anjer experienced the catastrophic 27th of August with a massive wave that engulfed the town, leading to immense destruction and loss of life. The eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 not only caused immediate devastation but also had far-reaching global impacts, with dust and waves encircling the world multiple times.|"1.
