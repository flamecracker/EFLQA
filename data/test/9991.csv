Early humans lived in a world filled with fear and hunger, surrounded by enemies like wolves, bears, and sabre-toothed tigers. They left no homes or tools behind, only their bones, showing they existed over two thousand centuries ago. These humans had a basic understanding of the changing seasons, knowing winter led to spring, then summer for ripe fruits and corn, followed by animals preparing for hibernation in fall. Competition for food led to deadly fights, forcing some to flee. Eventually, a glacier descended, destroying the valley and its inhabitants. Those who survived had to adapt, learning to make clothing from animal fur to endure the cold. By hunting and utilizing resources wisely, they overcame challenges and thrived.|"1.

In ancient Egypt, every village had Village-Elders, wise old men who guided the community. In times of crisis, a strong man, chosen by the Elders, led the soldiers during wars and managed flood situations. This leader was given the title of a King or a prince, respected and obeyed for the common good. In return, he collected taxes to fund communal needs. This system of nobles evolved from simple beginnings. For instance, Mr. Fish, a successful farmer, sold his grain in Memphis, while Mr. Sparrow struggled due to past misfortunes. The Sparrow family's troubles stemmed from a past deception by a Phoenician trader, leaving them in dire need.

A) Economic collapse
B) Political corruption
C) Military focus
D) Cultural decline
E) Technological advancements"|C) Military focus**|Yes
All human societies, including states and dynasties, follow patterns of growth and decline. The once-prosperous rulers of the Egyptian Empire, after four centuries of success, grew complacent. Rather than leading their army, they stayed secluded, enjoying music within their palace walls. When rumors of pillaging tribes surfaced, an army was sent but was annihilated by fierce Arab invaders. The Hyksos, or Shepherd Kings, seized power for five centuries, ruling harshly. A Theban uprising led to their expulsion, but the lesson was learned: Egypt needed a strong defense. King Tethmosis expanded into Asia, but the empire weakened due to military focus. Assyria's rise led to Egypt's defeat, marking the decline of the once-great Egyptian Empire.|"6. What event marked the decline of the Egyptian Empire?
A) Invasion by Persians
B) Defeat by Assyrians
C) Civil war
D) Natural disasters
E) Economic collapse"|B) Defeat by Assyrians**|Yes

In 1472, before Columbus found America, Venetian Josaphat Barbaro traveled through Persia and saw old temples cut into the hills near Shiraz. The temples were in ruins, but Barbaro noticed long inscriptions in a strange script that looked like scratches. He shared his discovery, but it was forgotten due to the threat of a Turkish invasion. Two centuries later, Roman Pietro della Valle visited the same hills and copied the inscriptions. In the 18th century, King Frederick V of Denmark led an expedition to western Asia, where all but one member died. Patient efforts by German schoolmaster Grotefend led to deciphering the inscriptions. Henry Rawlinson, serving in Persia, decoded the cuneiform language from the Behistun inscription. This solved a human mystery from the land of Sumer, revealing their worship practices and history.|"1. What did Josaphat Barbaro discover in Persia in 1472?

In ancient times, the Assyrians under the rule of adventurous leaders like Bulu attempted to expand their empire. They conquered lands like Asia Minor, Armenia, Egypt, and Babylonia, ruling with cruelty and greed. However, their empire faced internal strife due to excess military focus over agriculture and governance issues. The Assyrians faced constant battles, depleting their soldiers and leading to the recruitment of foreign fighters who lacked loyalty. The Cimmerians, displaced by the Scythians, invaded Mesopotamia, causing havoc. Meanwhile, the Chaldeans from Ur waged war against the Assyrians. Nebuchadnezzar's reign saw the rebuilding of temples, palace constructions, and irrigation projects. The Babylonians conquered Egypt and destroyed Jerusalem, taking Jewish hostages. They also studied the skies, discovering the first five planets known as Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Mercury, and Saturn.|"1. What lands did the Assyrians conquer under the rule of leaders like Bulu?

The Babylonians were clever inventors who divided the equator into 360 degrees, the day into 24 hours, and the hour into 60 minutes. They used a sun-dial to measure time. They used both the decimal and duodecimal systems, with the latter accounting for 60 minutes and seconds and 24 hours. The decimal system we use today doesn't include these convenient divisions. Despite their intelligence, the Babylonians couldn't avoid their fate. Alexander the Great visited Babylon in 331 B.C., marking its decline. The Persians conquered the fertile valley, leading to Babylon's downfall. Babylon had been a spiritual and intellectual center for centuries. In Egypt, Joseph, a Hebrew, managed food distribution during a famine. The Egyptians, after overthrowing foreign rulers, disliked outsiders.

Initially, the Jews and Canaanites were at odds but eventually became allies against the Philistines, a European group that had settled on the Mediterranean shores. The Philistines posed a constant threat to the Jews, who fought many battles but struggled to maintain their independence.|"5. Who were the constant threat to the Jews in the passage?

Phoenician sailors, Semites from Arabia, built ancient cities like Tyre and Sidon. They sailed the Mediterranean, trading with far-off lands. Their trading posts in Europe attracted locals who marveled at the goods from the east. Over time, these posts grew into bustling marketplaces. Modern cities like Marseilles and Cadiz trace their roots to Phoenicia. However, the Phoenicians were known for shady practices, like trading slaves and cheating others. Despite being skilled navigators, their dishonesty led to their downfall when other nations learned to sail. Tyre and Sidon lost their commercial dominance due to their unethical ways. While ancient civilizations like Egypt and Mesopotamia had unique writing systems, our modern alphabet is a mix of various influences. Its origins remain a mystery awaiting discovery through further research.|"1. What were Phoenician sailors known for?

In the past, I shared about the Aramaean traders' language, a common tongue in western Asia. Unlike the Phoenicians, whose language was not favored, their writing system spread widely. The Phoenicians, practical traders, developed a simple alphabet for efficient communication. Their alphabet, with only 22 letters, replaced complex hieroglyphics. This innovation, born out of necessity for quick business dealings, later influenced the Greeks. The Greeks adapted the alphabet to suit their language, adding new letters. This streamlined system, with vowels included, became popular and is now used worldwide for writing and passing down knowledge. Ancient civilizations along the Nile, in Mesopotamia, and the Mediterranean laid the foundation for our modern world, marking a shift from nomadic life to settled societies, exploration, and moral discoveries.|"1.
