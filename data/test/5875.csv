The _Falcon_ changed direction and moved away. Sam defiantly stated, ""We won't ask for your help. I'd rather drown."" But Sam didn't mean it literally. They could all swim and were not in immediate danger. The two boats were now far apart, making communication difficult. The Rover boys focused on the _Spray_. ""We are going down,"" Tom groaned.
