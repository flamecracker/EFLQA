In the mountains of Switzerland, there is a unique phenomenon known as a glacier. Scientists have debated for a long time about why glaciers flow. Some believe it's due to the pressure of ice and snow behind them, forcing them to move down valleys. Others argue that glaciers are in a semi-fluid state, similar to water but not as fluid. The Scottish Professor Forbes suggested that glaciers are ductile and flow like water, molding the ground beneath them. To demonstrate this, an experiment was conducted where a wire cut through a bar of glacier ice due to pressure, with the water freezing instantly behind it. The group plans to visit the Mer de Glace, a beautiful spot in the midst of glaciers, to witness these phenomena up close.|"1. What is the unique phenomenon found in the mountains of Switzerland?

In the mountains of Switzerland, there is a unique phenomenon known as a glacier. Scientists have debated for a long time about why glaciers flow. Some believe it's due to the pressure of ice and snow behind them, forcing them to move down valleys. Others argue that glaciers are in a semi-fluid state, similar to water but not as fluid. The Scottish Professor Forbes suggested that glaciers are ductile and flow like water, molding the ground beneath them. To demonstrate this, an experiment was conducted where a wire cut through a bar of glacier ice due to pressure, with the water freezing instantly behind it. The group plans to visit the Mer de Glace, a beautiful spot in the midst of glaciers, to witness these phenomena up close.|"5. Where do the group plan to visit to witness the phenomena of glaciers up close?

The massive ice river, known as the Mer de Glace, flows down from Mont Blanc, the giant mountain of Europe. Formed by a collection of ice streams that melt perpetually, the glacier is a majestic and awe-inspiring sight. Surrounded by sharp peaks and wild gorges, the glacier is hemmed in by a group of Titans, creating a picturesque and grand spectacle. As the glacier flows down, it encounters narrow passages, forcing its way through with steady determination. Despite the constant melting and reformation, the ice river persists year after year, a testament to the enduring power of nature. This glacier is just one of many in the vast glacial world of Switzerland, with over 600 glaciers in the region. Nature's wonders are truly remarkable and offer a wealth of knowledge to those who seek to understand them.|"1. What is the main topic of the passage?

While they carefully made their way down the rocky terrain left behind by the glacier, the Professor sketched the Duke of Wellington's nose surrounded by rocks in his notebook for future reference. The assistant with the first stake was not very bright, luckily Lawrence and the guide Antoine Grennon helped him. Using signals, they positioned him where the first stake should go. The telescope was adjusted, and the man placed the stake where the spider's threads intersected. An auger hole was drilled, and the stake secured. Moving across the glacier was challenging due to steep, dislocated ice covered in blocks and crevasses. Antoine skillfully crossed treacherous ice formations to plant stakes. With ropes for safety, they overcame obstacles to mark the path accurately.|"1. What was the Professor doing while they navigated the rocky terrain?

Antoine, a member of the group, expressed concern about the stability of the ice where they were fixing stakes. Another crash was heard, causing the ice mass to slide forward. Lawrence, acting swiftly, led the group to safer ground, displaying remarkable agility. The stakes were then strategically placed in a straight line. The Professor used a telescope to ensure their precise alignment. After securing the theodolite's position, they decided to have lunch and return the next day to observe the results. As they gathered the scattered party, each member had become engrossed in various activities, forgetting the time. Despite the day's challenges, the group found strength and camaraderie at Montanvert, where they prepared for more lighthearted adventures. The Professor, with a sense of humor, declared a break from science, and they crossed the Mer de Glace to the Chapeau, enjoying the beauty of the surroundings.|"1.

"Using the vocabulary provided, here is a refined version of the passage:

Looking through his surveying tool, he discovered that the markers were perfectly aligned, one above the other. He then marked the instrument's position and finished his work for the day. The next day, he returned to find that the lower marker had moved down over two inches, the middle one over three inches, and the top one exactly six inches. This confirmed that glacier movement is quicker at the top due to less friction compared to the bottom. Meanwhile, the artist was captivated by the ice formations and colors, planning to paint them. Suddenly, a large ice obelisk started to move, causing a grand yet alarming sight. Ignorant of the danger, they sketched near a crevasse, with the ledge thinning under the heat. The boy, losing interest, decided to play with a rope attached to the artist, setting up a mischievous plan."|"1. What did the surveyor discover when looking through his tool?

"Using the vocabulary provided, here is a refined version of the passage:

Looking through his surveying tool, he discovered that the markers were perfectly aligned, one above the other. He then marked the instrument's position and finished his work for the day. The next day, he returned to find that the lower marker had moved down over two inches, the middle one over three inches, and the top one exactly six inches. This confirmed that glacier movement is quicker at the top due to less friction compared to the bottom. Meanwhile, the artist was captivated by the ice formations and colors, planning to paint them. Suddenly, a large ice obelisk started to move, causing a grand yet alarming sight. Ignorant of the danger, they sketched near a crevasse, with the ledge thinning under the heat. The boy, losing interest, decided to play with a rope attached to the artist, setting up a mischievous plan."|"4. What caused a grand yet alarming sight in the passage?

Mrs Stoutley mentioned a book on Physical Geography of the Sea that her son admires, but she found it tedious. The Professor shared a story about a rescue mission at sea, where Captain Maury's knowledge of ocean currents helped locate a stranded vessel accurately. This knowledge saved the crew and troops. The group then embarked on an adventure to ascend Mont Blanc, a challenging mountain. Antoine Grennon led the group slowly, knowing the importance of pacing oneself during such a climb. The ascent required them to stay overnight at a place called the Grands Mulets before continuing towards the summit the next day. The journey demanded patience and perseverance, especially for young climbers like Lawrence and Lewis, who had to learn the value of pacing themselves to conquer the mountain successfully.|"1.

The group on the mountain included the Professor, Captain Wopper, Lewis, Lawrence, and Slingsby, led by their guide and three porters carrying supplies. Baptist Le Croix, a chamois-hunter, brought up the rear as they trekked in a line through the changing landscape. Emerging from the pine trees, they entered an open area with diverse flora, including larch and hazel trees, rhododendrons, and colorful flowers. Climbing steadily over glaciers, they faced challenges like crossing crevasses and navigating slippery ridges. At one wide crevasse, a missing ladder caused a setback until the guide found a partially collapsed snow-bridge. The chamois-hunter tested the fragile structure, revealing the risky path ahead. The team faced obstacles on the icy terrain, requiring caution and teamwork to advance.|"1. What diverse flora did the group encounter on their trek?

The surface gave way, appearing as though even that slight weight could dislodge the mass, but the operation actually consolidated it due to what the Professor termed ""regelation."" He cautiously stepped onto it, crossed over, and pulled the rope behind him. Antoine followed, and soon the entire group safely reached the other side.""Indeed?"" Lawrence chuckled, ""I don't see our situation as bleak. Doesn't the relaxed demeanor of our guide and porters suggest that this work appears riskier than it truly is?""As they ascended to higher glacier regions where snow often conceals narrow crevasses, making them treacherous traps, they linked together with a rope around their waists, spaced a few feet apart to aid in rescuing anyone who might fall through. Moving forward in a line, they were halted by a surprised shout from Captain Wopper, who had sunk into the snow. An alarmed cry ensued as he became waist-deep, and then a loud yell as he almost plunged into a hidden crevasse that others had safely crossed. Fortunately, his companions pulled him out in time.""Well,"" he panted, wiping sweat from his brow after crossing the chasm, ""land-lubbers talk about sailors having only a plank between them and death, but"|"6.

Antoine carefully planned and executed their journey, but it took over an hour to find a safe bridge. Once they crossed, they had to navigate a challenging path due to the ice formations. The group faced steep snowy inclines with precarious ice blocks above. Passing under potential avalanches made them uneasy. As they progressed, the rising sun illuminated the snow, but the summit still seemed distant. The travelers traversed the Petit Plateau, a plain for glacier avalanches, surrounded by towering mountain peaks. The ascent became harder as the snow softened, slowing their pace. Finally, reaching the Grand Plateau cheered them up, especially when they realized it was time for breakfast. The group enjoyed a meal, and the joy of intellectual and material nourishment was evident. Laughter and camaraderie filled the air, enhancing their experience.|"1.

Lewis hesitated, reluctant to accept Lawrence's warning about the dangers of walking alone on the glaciers. Lawrence emphasized the risks of traversing steep slopes of ice on new-fallen snow without a rope. He stressed the guide's advice on the perils of neglecting caution on such slopes, citing the potential for being smothered or swept into a crevasse by slipping snow.

Lewis and his companion, Le Croix, were perched on a rocky ledge after a tiring climb. Le Croix used a telescope to spot chamois in a distant gorge. They carefully descended the steep mountain to approach the game silently. As they neared, the hunter cautioned Lewis to wait for a clear shot and not rush. Lewis felt a mix of excitement and solitude in the wild setting. He was left alone momentarily, feeling the vastness and potential danger of the mountains. Suddenly, a shot rang out, and Lewis saw a chamois fall. As another chamois approached, he aimed, fired, and missed, but the bullet struck another chamois. The successful shot left the animal lifeless on the rugged terrain. Lewis's calmness and precision in the moment showcased his hunting skills.|"1.

After safely storing their catch, the hunter proposed exploring the higher slopes of a nearby glacier since they wouldn't find more game in their current spot. Lewis, surprised but eager for adventure, agreed. Armed with Alpine hatchets, they left their rifles in a cave for the night. As they climbed, they spotted a chamois on the ice below. The creature hesitated but eventually fled. Suddenly, a storm approached with rumbling rocks and an avalanche. They narrowly escaped by seeking refuge behind a boulder. The hunter shared a harrowing experience, and they hurried down the mountain to avoid an impending storm.

The young mountaineer was confident, while the experienced climber was kind and flexible. Due to the urgency of the situation, they decided to tackle the steeper slopes. Starting with a glissade down a very steep snow-slope, they descended to a terrace. Le Croix went first, using his axe to control his speed. Lewis, following, lost balance and tumbled down. Expecting this, Le Croix caught him, and they slid together to the bottom. As they aimed for a glacier thousands of feet below, the cliffs grew steeper. They moved quickly, navigating ledges and steep slopes. They eventually reached an icy slope, which Le Croix carved steps into for safe descent.

A dark cloud loomed ahead of the explorers, followed by a blinding lightning flash and thunder. The echoes bounced off the cliffs like mountain spirits playing tennis. Rain poured, darkening the scene. Seeking shelter under a rock, they waited out the storm. Despite their courage, fear crept in as they faced the perilous cliffs. Fear, they knew, was not inaction but unreasonable dread. They prepared for the night, finding a narrow ledge to rest on. With only a small piece of bread for sustenance, they built a protective wall of stones. They agreed to take turns sleeping, with one staying awake to prevent rolling off the ledge. A disagreement arose over who should sleep first, but they settled with Lewis taking the first shift. As they settled in for the night on the hard granite ledge, the cold and precarious position weighed heavily on their minds.|"1. What did the explorers do when they encountered the storm?

Lewis found himself in a peculiar situation, guarding the chamois-hunter as he slept on a precarious ledge. Anxiously watching over his companion, Lewis's mind wandered to thoughts of his friends back in Chamouni. He imagined how each of them would react to his current predicament. The sound of avalanches in the distance added to the tension of the night. Suddenly, Nita Horetzki appeared on a dangerous ledge, startling Lewis. As he tried to rise in alarm, a portion of the ledge collapsed, but the hunter assured him he had been asleep. The cold and wet conditions made it challenging for both of them to endure the night. As dawn broke, Lewis listened to the hunter muttering about gold in his sleep, wondering if the man was truly a gold-hunter gone mad. Lewis contemplated the unpredictability of thoughts as he gazed at the emerging light in the sky.|"1. What was Lewis thinking about as he guarded the chamois-hunter?

It's peculiar how someone who used to hunt chamois in the mountains can turn into a gold-hunter. The former job seems more respectable, yet there are many gold-hunters in the world. Gamblers are also like gold-hunters; I used to be one too! Despite warnings, I kept playing billiards every night here. I even feel guilty for taking gold from poor Leven, but I paid him back. Now, my stakes are just for fun. But, shouldn't I enjoy a game for the game itself? Even the smallest bet involves the thrill of gambling. Nita, who is as precious as gold, doesn't seem to approve of it. I wonder why it bothers her so much. Later, the mountaineers continued their descent, facing challenges, and moved swiftly towards where they left the chamois the day before. A conversation followed, revealing inner struggles and the search for hope beyond the mountains.|"1. What is the author's previous occupation before becoming a gold-hunter?
