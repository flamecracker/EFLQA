Deep in the ground, in a cozy hole nestled amidst the forest, I reside. At the base of my burrow lies a charming little room where I rest on a soft bed at night. Whenever danger looms, I seek refuge in my hole until all perils pass.

Santa fashioned a toy rabbit in my likeness, meticulously sewing fur and glass eyes. The resemblance was uncanny, blurring the lines between the toy and me.|"1.
