The lieutenant carefully studied the charts and Coast Pilot, learning that the Teaser might not be able to navigate Santa Rosa Sound due to its shallow depth. Even during spring tides, the water only rose a few inches above two feet. Realizing the Teaser's limitations, he shared his findings with Captain Breaker. Flint, known for minding his own business, accompanied him as they explored Santa Rosa Island. The desolate island led them to Pensacola Bay, where they could barely see through the mist. After a two-mile row, Christy directed the crew to head back slowly, aware that heavy work might lie ahead. Confident in their progress, Christy and Flint continued their investigation, focusing on the narrow spit of land they had reached.|"1.
