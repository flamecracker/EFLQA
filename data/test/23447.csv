"""Goo-goos"" is a term used for Philippine raiders. When a local fighter wants to rest or gather information, they hide their weapons and pretend to be friendly when entering the American lines. This is why soldiers refer to all Filipino fighters as goo-goos. Hal Overton used a tool to peek at the distant grove where the Moros were hidden without exposing himself. Sergeant Overton mentioned they were not advancing, which was a relief.
