The girl silently approached the canoe and unwrapped a deerskin bundle. From it, she retrieved a fire-bag adorned with beads, similar to those carried by Indian chiefs.

Cheenbuk decided to add an air of mystery to their expedition, even though he wasn't entirely sure of their goal or how long they would be away.

Upon seeing it, Aglootook regained some of his self-esteem and, with a look of profound wisdom, expressed his belief that they could have avoided this difficulty if they had followed his advice and traveled in the correct direction. Cheenbuk acknowledged his mistake, prompting Anteek to gaze at the nearby icebergs thoughtfully. The team was led towards the most passable part of the ridge, a challenging crossing where blocks seemed insurmountable. Cheenbuk's perseverance found narrow passages, and when blocked, he and the Indian cleared the way while Anteek guided the dogs and Oolalik steered the sled. Nootka observed, while Aglootook offered advice no one heeded. The group discovered a dead sailor, likely lost while searching for Eskimos, and buried him before continuing their journey towards the distant land seen by Nazinred.

After the explosion at the ship, the Eskimos gathered what they could salvage. With the guidance of Nazinred and Adolay, they sorted through the items left behind.
