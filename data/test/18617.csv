At midnight, a twinkling light from a village near Seahorse Key was spotted. The crew prepared for the boat expedition, ensuring the oars were muffled to avoid detection. Christy led the first cutter, while Flint led the second, both boats ready for the mission.|"6. Who led the first cutter during the boat expedition?
