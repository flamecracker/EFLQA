"Once the elderly man entered the kitchen, he settled on the hob with his cap perched up the chimney, as it was too tall for the roof. ""You'll dry there soon, sir,"" Gluck assured him, and resumed tending to the mutton. However, the old man continued to drip among the cinders, causing the fire to sputter and look uncomfortable. Gluck then warmed a plate and sharpened a knife, determined to cut the mutton. Just as he sliced the meat, a loud knock echoed at the door. The old man hastily jumped off the hob, and Gluck hurried to open the door. When a rolling pin swung towards Gluck's head, the old man's cap deflected it, sending it spinning across the room. Angered, Hans lunged at the old man, but he too was spun around and tossed into a corner. The elderly man swiftly spun himself, donned his cap, and bid them farewell, promising a return at midnight. As he left, a ragged cloud passed by, followed by rain. The brothers, now frightened, secured the house and retired for the night. At midnight, a crash shook the house, and the door burst open, flooding the room. In the moonlight, they saw the old man reclining on a foam globe. Dawn revealed the valley destroyed by the flood, leaving only a white card on the kitchen table with a cryptic message."|"1. What did Gluck do to help the old man dry off in the kitchen?

Tom stood on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. As he looked at the long fence before him, a feeling of sadness washed over him.

Tom gave up the brush reluctantly but with eagerness in his heart. While Ben toiled in the sun, the retired artist sat in the shade, munching an apple and planning his next fun. Boys came by to mock but ended up helping whitewash. Tom cleverly traded chores for toys, amassing marbles, a jew's harp, and other oddities. By afternoon, he was rich in possessions and fun. Tom learned a valuable lesson - making something hard to get makes it desirable. He recalled a time as a child when he spent all his money on a whistle, regretting it later. This taught him to be wise with his resources. The story ends with a poem about rowing and the passage of time.|"4. What did Tom give up reluctantly but with eagerness in his heart?

I jumped into the mate's boat one morning, ready to chase a huge cachalot whale. The wind was light, the sky clear, and the whale was lazily floating.

We furled the sail, unshipped the mast, and rowed towards the whale. The mate's risky behavior put us in danger. The whale's tail swept towards us, hitting the boat and throwing everyone but me overboard. I narrowly avoided being swallowed by the whale. I clung to a rope, which led me to the whale's carcass.

While living in Bruhl for two years, I often heard a lady practicing music nearby. On summer evenings, her windows were open, and I would walk outside to listen.

The listeners were left in awe. The story then shifts to a Polyp, a tiny sea creature with unique characteristics.

The town prayed for the safe return of their loved ones from uncharted waters. A year passed, and Cartier set sail again, but no news came back. Tears were shed, and hearts were heavy with worry. However, unknown to them, Cartier was thriving in the northern forests, raising the _fleur-de-lis_ and cross on Mount Royal. Upon his return, he shared tales of icy lands and the wonders of the Algonquin braves. He recounted the beauty of the river and the fortress that guarded Canada's secrets. Peter Huber, son of a renowned bee observer, witnessed a fascinating ant war where red ants enslaved black ants to do their bidding.

The grandeur shines on fortress walls and snowy mountain peaks steeped in history. The sun's rays dance on the lakes, and the untamed waterfall jumps in splendor. Blow, bugle, blow, let the echoes soar wildly, answering, fading away. Listen closely, how faint and clear, the distant horns of Elfland echo sweetly. Let us hear the purple valleys respond. Love, like our echoes that roll from soul to soul, lasts forever. Charity is patient, kind, humble, and enduring. It never fails. When I was young, I thought as a child, but now I understand. Charity, faith, and hope endure, but the greatest is charity. The forests diminish before the treeless lands are reached, appearing young due to their slow growth. The woodlands in the Barren Grounds become bleak, covered in lichens and mosses, devoid of animal life during the harsh winter months. In May, with the melting snow, life returns as wild-fowl flock to the area to nest and rear their young.|"1. What is the main focus of the text passage?
