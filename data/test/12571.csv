"I woke up just before sunrise to the sound of footsteps approaching. I spotted the men before they noticed me, but I couldn't flee fast enough. They were the same individuals who you saved me from not long ago. I had been in the hospital for so long that I was still weak and couldn't escape quickly. I attempted to run, but it was futile. Spotting a barn, I dashed inside, hoping to delay them. When they set fire to the barn, trapping me, I surrendered. I managed to shoot one through a crack, but then I was hit in the side. The next thing I knew, I woke up to find out that you had rescued me.

A German assault started the battle on January 8. General Joffre modified his strategy slightly and the French quickly launched a counter-attack. The Aisne river was a key location, covering a seven-mile front. To the west, a deep valley bordered by roads from Soissons, La Fere, and Laon, led to a high plateau. The plateau, with steep ravines notched by the Aisne, allowed for strategic positioning of French troops. The French responded to the German offensive with a fierce artillery barrage, gaining ground but reducing their artillery fire to avoid hitting their own troops. The Germans, led by General Von Kluck, launched a counter-strike across the plateau. Despite facing well-fortified French trenches, the Germans successfully advanced.
