I dreamed of him growing up to be a gentleman, looking down on me, but I didn't mind. I wanted him to have a better life. I saved every penny for him, hoping he would see the world.

"""Poor lad!"" his master said, giving him a friendly pat. ""You're a good soul, too! Well, Jan, I'm here, you see. It didn't defeat me. I might have lost my way for a bit, but they held the school for me, and I got back to work. I'm resilient, lad, and not easily broken. I've found solace in animals as well. Many of them, like Rufus, found me. Stray puppies, cats with troubles, they all found a home with me. I always had company at mealtimes, which mattered most. People have said, 'Master Swift, how do you continue to teach after losing your own child?' But they're mistaken, Jan: it's made me care for every boy I come across.

Do you think my ambition had faded, lad? It resurfaced, Jan. I realized there might be boys in this dull place who could succeed with the opportunities I'd offer. I've seen nearly seven generations of boys come through this school, but that special one has never arrived. Society isn't to blame. There have been no hidden talents here since I arrived. Many boys with good hearts have passed through, but none with a thirst for the unknown. I've been disappointed over time, and though I've accepted the Lord's will, I've prayed for the chance to guide another man's son to greatness.
