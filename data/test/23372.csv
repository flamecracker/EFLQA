"The trees and bushes covered the small island right up to the water's edge with thick leaves that shone with the beautiful colors typical of North American forests in the fall. Just past the spot where they landed, there was an open grassy area that seemed like it was made by nature specifically for picnics. ""Do you think you can do it, Little Bill?"" asked Archie. ""There's a wet patch of moss you might not have seen. Do you want me to lift you over it so your moccasins stay dry?"" Billie couldn't walk through the woods or climb hills due to his weak legs, but he found contentment in simpler pleasures. Breakfast in the wilderness with fresh air, sunshine, and the sounds of nature was a delightful experience. Archie and Billie cooked a meal of wild ducks over a fire and discussed their plans for the day, which included hunting for food."|"1. What covered the small island up to the water's edge?

"In the early 1900s, two adventurous brothers set out in a small canoe to fish. Using a piece of pork as bait, they managed to hook a massive pike. The younger brother, Little Bill, struggled to handle the fish while his older brother, Archie, took charge of steering the canoe. After a fierce battle lasting hours, they finally reeled in a four-foot-long pike.

Later, the brothers devised a clever plan to attract ducks and geese for hunting. They crafted decoys from wood and mud to resemble the birds. As they concealed themselves among the bushes, the decoys successfully lured the wild fowl closer for a better shot. Their ingenuity paid off as the birds fell for the trap, mistaking the decoys for real companions."|"1. What did the brothers use as bait to hook a massive pike?

When the harsh winter ended, Dan recounted their struggles at Red River. Despite returning wiser and determined to be self-sufficient, hunger plagued them due to scarce fish, roots, and berries. Only wild parsnips and edible nettles saved them. Their hopes rose briefly with a good harvest, but bird attacks threatened their crops. Blackbirds and pigeons swarmed, requiring constant vigilance to protect the harvest. Forced to barter for survival, they faced jealousy and plots from the locals. Eventually, they were banished, seeking refuge at Jack River. The night, lit by fires and stars, offered a moment of respite. Amidst abundance and light hearts, they savored the present, children playing gleefully. Despite uncertainties, they found solace in the camaraderie and warmth of the fireside, embracing the wild and free spirit of the moment.|"1.

He explained that fighting should only occur when there is a just cause. Revenge, he argued, brings temporary pleasure but lasting bitterness.

When the Red River residents woke up the next morning, they were shocked by the disaster caused by the grasshoppers.

They flipped the canoe over to create a makeshift shelter, ignited a large fire in front of it, and prepared a simple yet satisfying meal by roasting three plump ducks. After dining and hydrating with water, they put the baby to sleep, lit their pipes, and sat by the warm fire, sharing their dreams and worries in a cloud of smoke.
