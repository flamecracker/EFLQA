Rollo was busy piling wood in the shed when Jonas hurried after a cow that had wandered off. Jonas quickly checked Rollo's work and advised him to place the larger ends of the sticks outward to prevent the pile from falling.

As he added one more stick, the entire pile started to wobble dangerously. Just in time, Rollo jumped back as the pile collapsed.
