The trio, Ned, Obed, and the Panther, trailed them cautiously, ensuring they remained unnoticed. Urrea's men swiftly crossed the Rio Grande, expertly navigating the waters. The prisoners were kept in the middle of the group. After ensuring a safe distance, Ned and his companions also crossed the river into Mexican territory. The landscape seemed aged and weary to Ned, evoking a sense of decay. As they continued their pursuit, they hoped for inclement weather to delay the prisoners' fate until higher authorities intervened. The next morning, both parties continued their journey, with the Panther using a vibrant scarlet serape to shield himself from the cold, feeling empowered by its red hue. The terrain grew rougher as they closely monitored Urrea's troop, noting a decline in their discipline.|"6. How did the Panther feel about using the scarlet serape?

As the night approached, raindrops began to fall on their faces, and the sun disappeared behind the clouds. The trio felt joyous as the dark and wet night arrived sooner than expected. Obed and Ned wrapped themselves in serapes to shield their bodies and firearms from the rain. They securely tied their horses by thorn bushes near Urrea's camp and proceeded on foot. In the darkness, they could barely distinguish figures and footsteps were muffled by the rain-soaked ground. Approaching Urrea's camp, they noticed a faint glimmer of the campfire. Amidst the trees, they spotted a low adobe hut where Urrea and his officers sought refuge. The rest of the band huddled under trees or by the fire, while prisoners remained bound in the rain. Ned's anger surged at the disorderly scene. The Panther noticed a shed near the woods, signaling a potential opportunity for rescue. They retreated into the bushes, waiting for the Mexicans to fall asleep. When silence enveloped the camp, they cautiously approached, finding most asleep except for two sentinels. The Panther's foresight proved true as they prepared for a stealthy operation.|"1. What did Obed and Ned use to shield themselves from the rain?

The Panther and the Texans faced a challenge: their horses needed water but couldn't reach the creek due to steep banks. Resourceful, they carved a path down the cliff for the horses. Old Jack, hesitant at first, was coaxed down by Ned's gentle encouragement. The other horses followed suit. While some kept watch for Mexican sharpshooters, the horses were safely watered and hidden in the thicket. Despite dwindling food supplies, the group remained hopeful.

They quickly began preparing their house for living. More firewood was brought in, and they used hatchets to fix hooks for their belongings. Some cleared snow for the horses to graze, while a nearby spring provided water. The Panther anticipated finding game like buffalo, deer, antelope, or wild turkeys. As they searched the dwarfed forest, a deer darted past. Obed spotted large footprints, likely from buffalo. After riding for two hours, Ned saw buffalo in the distance. The Panther shot a cow, leading a bull to charge at them. Ned refrained from shooting the bull, following the Panther's advice, and targeted a cow instead. With their successful hunt, they skinned the animals and rode away, feeling triumphant and grateful for their unity and success.|"1. What did the group use hatchets for in preparing their house?

Ned judged from Roylston's manner that dark days were ahead, but the merchant did not mention the subject again. At the end of a week, when they were amply supplied with everything except horses, the Panther decided to take Ned and Obed and go on a scout toward the Rio Grande.

They soon left the narrow belt of forest far behind them, maintaining an almost direct course toward the southeast. The point on the river that they intended to reach was seventy or eighty miles away, and they did not expect to cover the distance in less than two days.

"""You can do much for Texas there with me in New Orleans,"" said Roylston, as if he were making a final appeal to one whom he looked upon almost as a son. ""Perhaps you could do more than you can here in Texas.""

""Be it so,"" said Roylston. ""It is young blood. Never was there a truer saying than 'Young men for war, old men for counsel.' But the time may come when you will need me. When it does come send the word.""

They swiftly rode southward, now following a trail, keeping a keen watch for Mexican scouts. The barren winter landscape was lonely and desolate. Signs of an army passing were evident - campfire remains, horse skeletons, discarded clothing, and a broken wagon. They encountered mounds with wooden crosses marking where the wounded were buried. Approaching a woodland around a spring, evidence of Cos's forces using it as a camp was clear. The Panther examined the area closely, concluding they had stayed for several days. As they continued cautiously, Ned's sharp eyes were relied upon. They eventually sought shelter among trees, preparing for a potential encounter with the enemy. Amidst the cold wind and approaching twilight, they remained vigilant, ready for any Mexican threat.|"1. What were the signs of an army passing that the group encountered on their journey?

They spent hours in the woods, watching the sun's last red glow fade in the west, giving way to darkness and the emergence of stars. A scarlet flush appeared on the horizon, catching the Panther's attention. He informed Ned that they would ride towards it in about two miles and an hour, as the increasing darkness would aid their observations. As predicted, the night grew darker, with clouds obscuring some stars. However, the strange scarlet glow in the south intensified and expanded. Riding abreast, Ned was treated as an equal by Obed and the Panther, respected for his serious nature and eagerness to learn. They halted on a small rise, observing fires and men in the distance, hinting at a much larger force than expected. The Panther expressed concern about the Texan army's small size and the looming threat. They split up to scout the area discreetly, understanding the importance of stealth.|"1.

Ned lay still, observing the many tents in the camp, indicating a more extended stay than just a day. Among the officers in bright uniforms, his eyes locked onto a heavy-set, dark man - Cos, the breaker of oaths. Accompanying him was another officer, Sesma, identified by his general's uniform.

Cos and Sesma conversed about their arduous journey, expressing relief at not being in Santa Anna's direct command.

The four companions decided to return to the cabin before nightfall. They missed their friends but found comfort in the well-stocked cabin filled with buffalo, deer, and wild turkey meat.

Despite his warm clothing and blankets, the boy grew colder and colder. His teeth chattered, and he shivered uncontrollably. His head throbbed with intense pain, and even the slightest light hurt his eyes. He felt utterly miserable, lost in both body and soul. The pain in his head was so severe that life hardly seemed worth living. Eventually, he fell into a daze, vaguely aware of lying in a thicket in vast Texas. He was too weak to defend himself against any potential threats like cougars or bears. The idea of being found by anyone, even a million Mexicans, did not faze him. As his intense chill subsided, a fever took over, causing unbearable heat and unconsciousness. When he awoke the next day, he felt overwhelming fatigue and realized he was a shadow of his former self. Despite his weakness and dizziness, he mustered the strength to gather his belongings and survey the desolate landscape around him, resigned to whatever fate awaited.|"1.

Despite his warm clothing and blankets, the boy grew colder and colder. His teeth chattered, and he shivered uncontrollably. His head throbbed with intense pain, and even the slightest light hurt his eyes. He felt utterly miserable, lost in both body and soul.

The Texan sharpshooters, tired but determined, resumed their mission. Unable to spot the Indians, they relied on a clever tactic used in border warfare. Whenever an Indian fired, a puff of smoke revealed their location. The Texans swiftly aimed at the smoke and often hit their targets. This hidden gunfight lasted for hours.

The Texans mercifully put down the wounded animals to end their suffering. With their exceptional marksmanship, the Texans outmatched the Indians in the dark, forcing them to retreat to the Mexican cavalry. The night was unusually dark and foggy, concealing the sky. Ned noticed the campfires of the Mexican army, feeling bitter about the Texans' predicament. Despite the challenges, Fannin remained resolute, calling for a council to plan their escape from the dire situation.|"1. What clever tactic did the Texan sharpshooters use in the gunfight?
