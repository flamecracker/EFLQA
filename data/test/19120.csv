"""Spanish Joe's fate was too easy,"" Nick said casually. ""He was born for the rope, and fate caught up with him. Some say the same about me. Doesn't bother me, though. It's almost comforting, especially when a landslide sweeps you down a mountain like a train, as it did to me. Nothing can harm you if your end is destined by the rope.""

"Frank realized that his initial assumption was likely correct. Spanish Joe had somehow gotten his foot stuck in a crack while navigating the rocks and was unable to free it. The more he struggled, the more firmly it seemed to be trapped. Given the circumstances, it was understandable that he was frightened. 

""It's my leg, Nick,"" Spanish Joe cried out anxiously. ""I can't loosen it, and I've twisted and pulled so much that it feels like it's almost dislocated. See if you can help. Every time I move, that rock up there looks like it's about to fall on me! If it does, I'll be crushed.""

Frank was familiar with Spanish Joe, who had worked on the Circle Ranch until being dismissed for suspected involvement with cattle rustlers. Despite losing some of his national traits from working on American ranches, Spanish Joe still retained some characteristic dress. 

Frank wasted no time. He was concerned about the precarious rock overhead. It appeared ready to collapse, posing a grave threat to anyone beneath it due to its immense weight. 

Spanish Joe followed Frank's instructions eagerly. Despite the pain in his leg, he was determined, knowing that failure would likely result in a dire outcome.

If it lunges, aim for the center,"" advised Bob as they approached what they believed was the cave entrance mentioned by Spanish Joe. They reached the wall swiftly and confirmed the presence of the gaping hole. Frank, without hesitation, entered the opening, followed by Bob, gun at the ready. The torch illuminated the cave, revealing nothing extraordinary except its twisting path into the distance. Suddenly, Bob noticed the panther leaping towards him. Though he dropped his rifle, he deftly picked it up by the barrel.

"""I'm really relieved to hear you say that, Frank. We're deep inside now, so escaping would be impossible if something were to happen. The cave seems to be expanding as we move along,"" remarked Bob.
