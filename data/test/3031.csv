In the peaceful mornings, the crows flew high and straight, but in windy weather, they flew low along the ravine for protection. From my windows overlooking the ravine in 1885, I first spotted an old crow. A long-time resident told me that the crow had been flying in the ravine for over twenty years. Silverspot, the crow, stuck to his route despite the changes in the surroundings. Twice daily in March, April, late summer, and fall, he passed by, allowing me to observe his movements and interactions with his fellow crows. The crows displayed remarkable intelligence, with a language and social system akin to humans. One windy day, as the crow approached a high bridge, it noticed me and warned the group of potential danger. The crows adjusted their flight to avoid the perceived threat. The next day, when I pointed a walking stick at them, the crow sensed danger and flew higher. On the third day, carrying a gun, the crow recognized the threat and alerted the group to disperse and fly out of range. Their communication and responses revealed their complex social structure and ability to navigate dangers.|"1. What did the crows do when flying in peaceful mornings?

"In the early days of November in 1882, the Manitoba winter had just begun. I was relaxing in my chair after breakfast, gazing out at the prairie through our shanty window. Suddenly, a large gray animal sprinted into the cowshed, followed closely by a smaller black and white creature.

Startled, I recognized the larger animal as a wolf and grabbed my rifle to help the smaller dog, a collie from our neighbor. As I rushed out, the wolf and the collie darted out of the stable, engaging in a fierce chase over the snow. Despite my attempts to intervene with shots, they continued their intense pursuit.

The collie displayed remarkable courage and strategy, leading the wolf back towards the settlement with each run. After a mile of relentless fighting and running, I finally caught up with them. The collie, with renewed confidence from my presence, swiftly subdued the wolf by gripping its throat until I could end the struggle with a fatal shot.

Witnessing the collie's bravery and skill, I was eager to purchase him, but his owner refused, likening it to trying to buy one of his own children."|"1. What is the main event that takes place in the text?

"In the early days of November in 1882, the Manitoba winter had just begun. I was relaxing in my chair after breakfast, gazing out at the prairie through our shanty window. Suddenly, a large gray animal sprinted into the cowshed, followed closely by a smaller black and white creature.

Startled, I recognized the larger animal as a wolf and grabbed my rifle to help the smaller dog, a collie from our neighbor. As I rushed out, the wolf and the collie darted out of the stable, engaging in a fierce chase over the snow. Despite my attempts to intervene with shots, they continued their intense pursuit.

When Frank was absent, I had to settle for his supposed offspring - the son of his wife. This likely descendant of a renowned father was a chubby ball of black fur resembling a bearcub more than a puppy. He sported tan markings akin to Frank's coat, hinting at future greatness, and a distinctive white ring around his muzzle. After acquiring him, the challenge was to name him. The solution was apparent - the rhyme of 'Franckelyn's dogge' led to the grand naming ceremony, christening him 'little Bingo.' During that winter, Bingo resided with us, growing into a plump, well-intentioned, but mischievous puppy. Despite mishaps, like meddling with the rat trap and misinterpreting the cat's signals, he eventually excelled at herding our yellow cow. Bingo's enthusiasm for this task led to an excess of herding, disrupting the cow's grazing and milk production. Attempts to curb his fervor were futile, resulting in Fred resorting to a comical yet ineffective method involving a brick tied to the cow's tail. The ensuing chaos involving Bingo and the cow left everyone in a chaotic and humorous situation.|"1. What was the main reason for naming the chubby black fur puppy 'little Bingo'?

In the vast prairie between our home and Carberry village stood a significant corner-stake, a post marking the farm's boundary. Bingo, our loyal dog, had a peculiar fascination with this post.

Last winter, I had an encounter with a clever fox named Scarface. While out shooting after a snowfall, I spotted him in the brushy hollow near the old mill.

I later discovered his den cleverly hidden in the pines, a tactic he used to mislead potential threats. One day, I observed Scarface with his family, including four mischievous fox cubs. They played innocently, but their sharp features hinted at their future slyness. Scarface's mother proudly watched over her young, showing a mix of delight, wildness, and cunning, but above all, a mother's love and protection.|"1.

For many days, I observed the young animals being trained. They quickly learned to react to sounds and seek shelter when afraid. Unlike some animals that show kindness to others, Vixen, the fox, displayed a disturbing form of affection.

An hour later, the young fox had stopped running around or making noise. I peeked outside and saw the mother lying next to the cub, gnawing at a chain in the moonlight. Meanwhile, the cub, named Tip, was having a warm drink. The mother fled into the woods when I went outside, but I found two mice near the shelter-box, brought by the mother as food for the cub. In the morning, I noticed the chain near Tip's collar was shiny for a short distance. The three baby foxes were lying there, licked clean, with two hens nearby that the mother had killed. The ground showed signs of where the mother had mourned her young. She never returned after realizing they were gone. Tip, now the sole survivor, received all her love. The dogs were set loose to protect the hens, and orders were given to shoot the old fox on sight. The mother tried to dig a hole to free Tip from the chain but failed.

My sympathies shifted towards Vix, the mother fox, as she tried to free her captive young one. Despite multiple attempts, Vix's efforts were in vain. She braved dangers and tried every means to help her little one, but all failed. In a final act of sacrifice, Vix chose to free her young one by leading him to a poisoned bait, knowing it would bring him a swift death rather than a life in captivity. Vix's love for her offspring was strong, but her wisdom and sacrifice were even stronger. Eventually, when the snow covered the ground, it was revealed that Vix was no longer in the woods of Erindale. Her departure left a somber reminder of the tragedies she endured, perhaps seeking solace in a distant land or choosing to end her sorrowful life as she had freed her last surviving cub.|"1.

Around midday, the Pacer arrived, now alone after his group was captured. The path on the opposite side of the muddy area was rarely used. Old Tom hoped to guide the Stallion by throwing fresh rushes to ensure he took the usual route. Who protects and watches over wild animals? Despite reasons to stick to the usual path, the Pacer chose the other. The suspicious rushes didn't deter him; he calmly drank water. To prevent failure, Bates and Smith swiftly approached the trail behind him. As the Pacer neared the trap, a shot was fired, but the Stallion leaped over the ground and escaped unharmed. Wild Jo was determined to catch the Mustang using the relay chase plan. The Pacer's range was within a sixty-mile triangle, and Antelope Springs was his base. The chase began with horses sent ahead, each man ready at their post. The Pacer arrived alone, circled the Springs cautiously, then led the chase across different terrains. Jo tried to gain ground but struggled. The Stallion managed to elude Jo's efforts and reach Arroyo Alamosa, with Jo following closely, exhausted yet determined.|"1.

Two of the chicks, feeling superior, flew into a tree despite their mother's cries. The dog barked beneath the tree, amusing the chicks until gunshots rang out, causing two partridges to fall and be attacked by the dog. Cuddy, a hunter living near Toronto, led a simple life focused on hunting. He often flouted hunting regulations, shooting partridges out of season. The partridges, now wary of hunters, changed their roosting spot to a hemlock tree to avoid predators like coons and owls as the season changed.|"2.

The partridge's ruff, similar to the peacock's train, is its main beauty and pride. A hen's ruff is black with a hint of green, while a cock's is larger, blacker, and glossed with vivid bottle-green. Occasionally, a partridge is born with an extraordinary ruff, larger and intensively colored in coppery red, iridescent with violet, green, and gold. Redruff, a remarkable partridge in the Don Valley, developed a stunning gold and copper ruff. During the November moon of their first year, partridges go crazy, driven by an urge to wander. This behavior prevents inbreeding and is most intense in young partridges. Redruff's family was scattered during this time, and he found himself alone in the Mud Creek Glen. As winter progressed, Redruff faced challenges like scarce food and icy storms but adapted with nature's provisions, such as snow-shoes and icecreepers on his feet.|"1.
