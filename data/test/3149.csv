Another day, my beloved work fills me with happiness. I find joy in weaving the fabric of my daily happiness from the threads of my work. My friends do not understand this happiness, but I feel blessed, like Mary of old. I believe that God sends us into the world for various purposes. While marriage may be important, it is the love within it that truly matters. I may find my highest potential without marriage, but I know that deep love is essential for my growth. I feel destined to care for other people's children rather than having my own. My heart is devoted to my work, leaving little room for a husband. Men, for the most part, lack spiritual depth in their tenderness and loyalty. I wish we could create ideal lovers as portrayed in books. While I may not find a man who aligns with the virtues my work instills in me, I cherish children's love, woman's love, and man's friendship. These relationships fill my life with happiness, and I am content with the prospect of evolving into a nurturing figure for many.|"1. What brings the speaker happiness?

I was surprised to learn about female Mahatmas, as I had always assumed that an Adept needed years of silence before becoming one. There are different levels of Adepts, from the topmost Mahatmas to the Nirmanakayas, who help humanity without a physical body. As we go down the ranks, some Adepts and second-class Mahatmas live in their bodies, retaining the ability to project their souls anywhere instantly. Mrs. Grubb, despite her intellectual gymnastics, needs time to grow into a Chela. She consulted me about Soul Haven for the twins, a plan I find reasonable. If the matter isn't resolved soon, I'll find a way to change her mind by the new year. I've thought about funding for their education and care, and may need to make a public appeal. Just like Pastor Von Bodelschwingh's Baby Castle, where parents donated a penny for each healthy child, I hope for a similar outpouring of support for Lisa.|"1.

Even though I am grown up now, there are a few intangible things I wish to find in my stocking on Christmas morning. I hope that all the missed joyful moments of past Christmases will come to me this time. I wish Santa Claus would come down the chimney to grant my simple wishes. I sometimes doubt if he only goes to those who shout the loudest for grand gifts. But when I see his jolly face on a picture-book cover, all my suspicions vanish. I may be twenty-eight, but my whims and wishes will never change. I feel like sending a letter up the chimney to Santa! The children in the sunny land where it's a green Christmas seem content with the soft sunshine. Further south, mothers long for snowy days and warm fires. But the kids in the garden, surrounded by fragrant blooms, are happy. The city streets smell of violets, and the air is filled with the joy of the season. In Mistress Mary's garden, the children work in secret to prepare gifts for each other and for her. The anticipation and excitement fill the air as they eagerly await the day when the Wonderful Tree will bloom with gifts for all.|"1. What does the speaker wish for on Christmas morning?
