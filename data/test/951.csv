The aircraft Tom was working on had a unique design. Unlike traditional planes, Tom's craft had an air-cooled motor located at the front, just above the heads of the operator and passenger. The propeller was ten feet in diameter, providing a minimum thrust of one thousand pounds at two thousand revolutions per minute. This gave Tom's craft an advantage over others with smaller propellers that produced less thrust. Despite its light and delicate appearance, the monoplane was actually quite sturdy due to innovative bracing techniques. As Tom continued to work on his speedy aircraft with his father and Mr. Jackson, he couldn't shake off his worries about the missing plans. One day, while working on the plane in his shop, Tom was interrupted by Mrs. Baggert, who seemed troubled. Tom immediately feared for his father's health and rushed to attend to the situation.|"1.
