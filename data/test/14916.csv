"In the past, great men like Goethe and De Quincey had vivid imaginations that created worlds as real as their own surroundings. Goethe shared tales of a secret garden, while De Quincey ruled a kingdom until betrayed by his brother. All children, too, have imaginative moments, endowing objects with life and engaging in play.

The poet, who keeps the soul alive, is just as essential as the observer in society. Children, like their ancestors, live in a world of imagination, personifying natural elements.

The king's advisors, Hum-Drum and Kopy-Keck, proposed an unusual plan to cure the princess of her affliction by burying her alive for three years. When the king rejected this idea, they suggested making her cry to restore her lost gravity. They enlisted a beggar to tell a sad tale, hoping to evoke tears from the princess. However, instead of crying, she burst into uncontrollable laughter, even after the king tried to make her cry by whipping her. Meanwhile, a prince from a distant kingdom set out to find a princess to marry but rejected all he encountered.
