"When Naomi returned to Bethlehem, she was poor. The poor were allowed to gather leftover corn during harvest. One day, Ruth got permission to glean in the field of a rich man named Boaz, who was a relative of Elimelech. Boaz saw Ruth gleaning and asked about her. Ruth didn't know Boaz was related to her.
