A mountain range loomed on the horizon across the river, sparking a sense of adventure. Opting to journey north along the river, the explorers set up camp by a tranquil stream. During a prospecting expedition, they discovered a flint arrow embedded in the skull of a wild animal, leading to discussions about different arrow types. Feeling homesick, they noticed a distant light across the river, prompting them to fire a gun as a test. However, the light vanished, leaving them puzzled. During the night watch, they enjoyed an early breakfast before embarking on a scouting mission along the coast's steep hills. Upon shooting an animal, they were met with an echoing response, allowing them to calculate distances using sound. A bear attack ensued, but the team's skilled marksmanship saved them, concluding their rugged journey as they decided to head back home due to stormy weather. They utilized a traveling chart and innovative methods like an adjustable square to navigate their course, using shadows to determine angles.|"1. What sparked a sense of adventure for the explorers?

Health on the island was disrupted when Harry fell ill with a fever. To determine his temperature, they had to make a thermometer using substitutes for glass and mercury. They learned how the Fahrenheit and Centigrade scales were determined. After testing the thermometer, they found Harry had a dangerous fever. Meanwhile, as rains caused the Cataract River to rise, they decided to explore the sea coast to the east. Yoking up the yaks, they gathered plant samples at the beach and followed the shore, where they discovered a boat missing from the South River Falls. Inside, they found strange oars and rope. Harry and George planned to sail the boat to the Cataract River, but the Professor took the team home. While exploring, they sighted an object on the cliffs and went ashore for an examination, finding the wrecked remains of their life-boat. When their boat washed away, they had to retrieve the life-boat and float to the mainland, where they met the Professor for explanations.|"1. What disrupted the health on the island?

The following night, after dinner, they gathered in the wagon until late, discussing their future plans. It had been nine months since they left home, and the thought of being considered lost by their loved ones was hard to bear. Did the boys miss home? I don't need to suggest it; the reality was clear. Despite missing their beautiful home, caring family, and the uncertainty of their return, they faced danger and believed more perils awaited them. The Professor, a philosopher, understood the need for activity in the human mind, especially in young individuals. Boys are curious and active, needing direction for their energy. This led to the concept of manual training, where education blends brain and muscle work. Boys thrive when their efforts are purposeful, as seen in their projects like the water wheel, sawmill, and wagon. They found joy and fulfillment in their work, not seeking payment but valuing their accomplishments. The night ended with a daring plan proposed by the Professor, showcasing the importance of direction and purpose in their endeavors.|"6. How did the night end for the boys according to the text?
A) They got lost in the dark

Their quick preparations were evident as they acted promptly. Within minutes, a shot echoed, followed by a sudden darkness. The boys noticed the extinguished lights and hurried back to the Professor. He explained the phenomenon as caused by decaying matter releasing phosphorus gas that appears to burn but doesn't. They decided to take turns keeping watch at night and planned to start early the next day. George took the first watch, followed by Harry. However, Baby's restlessness disrupted their night as he cried loudly, startling them. Despite the tense atmosphere, they remained vigilant, scanning the surroundings every hour and mile, avoiding the river bed to prevent detection by potential enemies. The night passed in fits of sleep, with Harry preparing breakfast while Baby leaped nervously among nearby trees. The camp was on high alert, with the scout emphasizing the importance of keen observation and sound analysis. The next day, they journeyed through dense forests, and as George led the way, he encountered an animal and fired a shot, triggering a series of shots from the river. The group reacted swiftly, ready for any unexpected events.|"1. What caused the sudden darkness experienced by the boys?

Sound travels at a rate of 1,040 feet per second. I calculated that it took four seconds for Baby's cries to echo back from the hills. This means the sound had to travel to the hills and back, so it would take two seconds each way. The boys and the Professor quickly grabbed their guns to follow the bear. When Harry aimed his gun, the bear was less than a hundred feet away. The shots from the boys and the Professor didn't seem to affect the bear. The boys ran in different directions as the bear charged. When the bear got close, the Professor and the boys fired. The bear roared and headed for the wagon, causing the yaks to panic. The bear eventually fell over after running into a tree. They decided to head towards home after facing stormy weather and difficult paths. Using a bevel square, they could determine directions and measure distances on their journey.|"1. What is the speed of sound in feet per second?

The boys returned from their adventure and found themselves faced with various tasks. They needed to tan hides, cure a fresh bear pelt, and process barley they had harvested earlier. They decided to thresh the barley using flails, a traditional method before the invention of threshing machines. They then ground the barley into flour using grinding stones they had made previously. With a longing for bread, they ventured to make their first batch, understanding the process of fermentation that causes the dough to rise. As they worked, the Baby found the honey pot and made a mess, covering himself in honey. The boys explained the science behind bread-making, how the dough rises due to carbonic gas, and the baking process that sets the dough, leaving tiny holes in the bread.|"1.

George had a daily routine of observing the yaks to learn about their barley field's usefulness. One day, while out exploring, he ventured to the rock cliffs near Observation Hill. The heavy sea and incoming tide made him homesick, and he shed tears. Despite feeling ashamed, he knew crying was futile. Suddenly, he noticed a peculiar sight: with each wave, there was a cannon-like noise followed by a spray of water shooting out to sea. This phenomenon was caused by a cave in the cliff where compressed air exploded when the wave closed its mouth. George learned about earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, understanding the earth's movements and how mountains and valleys were formed. The boys, planning a hunting day, felt anxious about a missing boat at South River Falls. They set off on a familiar trail, reaching the river, where the surroundings puzzled George, unable to locate the ramie plant spot.|"1.

Chemists have discovered that humans and animals absorb oxygen and release nitrogen to survive. Plants, on the other hand, take in nitrogen and give off oxygen. Certain germs can produce nitrogen, just like some germs create carbonic gas in dough. The United States Department of Agriculture, through its chemical division, has decided to utilize these germs. They provide a box filled with millions of these tiny creatures to farmers who request them. The germs are mixed with water and seeds, like corn, before planting. The germs stick to the seeds and continue to work in the soil, producing nitrogen that plants absorb. This process enhances plant growth, as seen in fields where germ-infected seeds are compared to untreated rows.|"1. What do humans and animals absorb to survive?

In Ireland, the shamrock represents the trinity with its three leaves, as taught by St. Patrick. The plant has unique qualities; it folds its leaves at night and adjusts to light with great precision. Odors, like sounds and light, are vibrations. Each odor has its own vibration rate, much like musical notes. Some scents harmonize, while others clash due to wrong combinations. Turpentine, lemon, orange, juniper, and rosemary odors are formed by carbon and hydrogen. The colony saved seeds for a garden to avoid hunting for food. Combining vegetables creates chemical similarities in different countries. The boys were surprised by an increase in yaks. The bull, a majestic dark red yak, charged at George, who sought refuge behind a cow during a stampede.|"1. What does the shamrock represent in Ireland according to St. Patrick?

Every morning, the yaks left their enclosure for the feeding grounds. Sometimes, Harry or George would follow and hunt. Once, Harry was on a hill, George saw the flash of his gun before hearing the shot. George learned about the difference between sound and noise. Sound is organized vibrations like music, while noise is chaotic. Light travels faster than sound, explaining why the flash was seen before the shot was heard. The pitch of a sound changes when the distance between the source and the listener alters. A sketch illustrates how the pitch of a whistle changes as two trains approach and pass each other. Despite good health on the island, Harry felt unwell, showing signs of fever. A device is described to measure changes in pitch.|"1. What did George see before hearing the shot on the hill?

The Fahrenheit scale was created under unique circumstances. Fahrenheit used his body temperature as a reference point and assigned 86 degrees to it. Zero on his scale was the lowest temperature he observed in 1709. When ice melted in water, he noted 32 degrees on his thermometer. Although not very scientific, it served its purpose. To determine body temperatures, a device was made with a C-shaped piece. The scale went up to 110 degrees, with 80 as the starting point. Harry's temperature was 102, George's 98, and the Professor's 90. The device worked based on metal contraction and expansion due to heat. Water under pressure acts like a solid, trying to move in a straight line. This experience highlighted the importance of being prepared for illness and the wonders of the natural world.|"1.

George and Harry set off on a journey to the east coast with their yaks after a hearty lunch. They reached the coast within two hours, spending time collecting plant samples along the way. They found a cape and the mouth of the South River. While searching for clams, Harry stumbled upon their boat from three months ago, hidden in shrubbery. The boat was full of debris, and they found a mysterious rope and oar inside, suggesting someone else had used it recently. They decided to take the boat back home and planned to pilot it around the cliffs to the Cataract River mouth for future use. The Professor waited for them but they didn't return by sundown.|"1.

Let's follow the boys as they encounter a series of challenges during their boat journey. The boat was equipped with oars and a rope, but the mast and sail had been removed, requiring them to row around a point. As they set off, a light wind picked up, pushing the boat adrift. The boys realized their mistake too late, with the boat out of reach. Stranded on a rocky coast, they found the broken remains of the boat wedged between rocks. With night approaching, they had to dislodge the boat to reach shore. After a struggle, they managed to break off a piece of the boat's side to steer it towards land in the growing darkness, determined to overcome the challenges they faced.|"1.

"The process of wire drawing might seem simple with the right tools, but in Harry's case, they had to work with basic equipment. Harry started by shaping bars of copper into pieces about ten inches long and half an inch thick. Using a steel plate with holes of varying sizes, they pulled the copper bars through to create thinner wires. The friction generated during this process produced heat by forcing tiny particles called atoms and molecules in the metal to move and interact. In another part of the story, ""Baby,"" the orangutan, learned to use a knife and fork at the table and even helped with tasks like gathering nuts.

No! The baby was not punished. He came down willingly, holding some cookies, and sat at the table. The line between tears and laughter is very thin. They laughed as if they had never heard of tears. When they tried to continue eating, just one look at the baby made them burst into laughter again. Something unexpected happened. The baby, who never laughed before, laughed for the first time. This made everyone laugh even more. The Professor mentioned how laughter is contagious and powerful, just like how perfumes can travel long distances. He compared laughter to a perfume that spreads joy without needing purification, unlike harsh words that are like foul odors needing purification. They enjoyed a meal of roast prairie chicken, lentils, potatoes, cassava, sago pudding, and cakes. They drank fresh water from a spring, as the river water sometimes tasted bad. The Professor explained how tannic acid from oak bark can purify water, similar to how bitter almonds clarify Nile waters in Egypt. In India, a nut called Strychnos is used for the same purpose. The passage shows the importance of laughter and the science behind water purification.|"1. What did the baby do that made everyone burst into laughter?

The flowing Cataract water picks up albuminous matter as it passes through forests and vegetable banks. The impurities in the water, like astringent substances from oak or birch trees, cause the albumen to precipitate. In La Gironde, France, water from the Landes area was naturally impure due to these factors. However, cutting down oak forests improved the water quality. The primary electric battery was being developed steadily, with cells made of clay, zinc, and copper electrodes. Each cell was heavy, baked, and measured ten inches deep. The boys planned to build a new boat, deciding on a smaller vessel due to crew size and manageability. Harry suggested a boat similar in size to the previous one, with a flat bottom and a contracted prow. They surveyed the surroundings from Observation Hill and decided to explore the rocky side towards the sea, noting the dangers of navigation among rock islands.|"1.

The rising tide created swirling currents, indicating the need to take the wrecked lifeboat out to sea past the rocks. Despite some hesitation, the hill's surroundings were carefully inspected. Below, among seaweed and debris, an intriguing find piqued their interest. The Professor pointed out that the recovered pieces did not match their lifeboat but belonged to a ship's boat. Harry confirmed this by noting the absence of a double hull and the intact stern below. Further exploration led to the discovery of a hidden white object, revealed to be a skull. The Professor expertly analyzed the skull's condition, deducing the age of the deceased individual. Overwhelmed by the find, the boys gathered the skeleton while the Professor stayed behind. They solemnly returned to the Cataract for assistance, reflecting on the fate of the ship's crew.|"1. What did the rising tide create in the passage?

This morning, we observed an interesting phenomenon with the wires from our battery. When the circuiting ends of the wires were connected, there was no current, but when they were pulled apart, a spark was produced. Let's conduct a simple experiment to demonstrate this spark. By sharpening the ends of the wires and adjusting their distance, we can create an electric arc. The arc light invention was based on this principle, where the current adjusts to maintain a steady light. As we prepared to explore the cliffs with our yaks, a distant ship was spotted, raising hopes that were later dashed as the ship sailed away. Despite the setback, the group remained vigilant, scanning the horizon for any signs of rescue.|"1. What phenomenon did the group observe with the wires from their battery this morning?

The Professor suggested going a hundred feet into the cave and placing a lamp in a visible spot. They could then proceed with the other lamp towards the water, ensuring a backup light in case of any mishaps. As they advanced, the cave floor sloped downwards, and despite reaching a larger area with eerie icicles hanging above, there was still no sign of water. The group decided it was unwise to continue with just one light and planned to create more lights to illuminate the entire cave. To mark their findings, they needed a base line and a way to chart their discoveries. Harry proposed using chalk for markings since they had no paper available.|"1.

First, let's establish a starting point, which we'll label as A. From the spot where the light disappeared, measure westward along the line until you reach the end of the chamber. If each measurement of the spear is 5 feet, then the chamber is 125 feet long and about 90 feet wide. Let's roughly sketch out the floor plan. Moving towards the cave's entrance, measure 50 feet and stop. I've marked the line A and placed a slate slab to align with your measurements. The point B, 50 feet from here, forms an angle C. I'll move the slab to point B for another 50 feet, creating angle line E. Each new point establishes a new baseline. As we mark points, observe the side walls to outline the passageway's irregularities. The boys were captivated by the chart, only remembering the lost light upon exiting the cave, sparking wonder and curiosity. They returned home with mixed feelings after experiencing the world above and below ground. The source of water in the cave is likely rain seeping through the floor. The extent of the cave remains a mystery, fueling their curiosity for further exploration. Remember the flag as we continue our investigations. The boys were eager to work on the flag the next day, using yellow ramie cloth and aiming for red, yellow, and blue colors if available.|"1. What did the boys use to measure the chamber's length and width?

"In the laboratory, manganese ore reacts with sulfuric acid to produce chlorine gas, a powerful bleaching agent. This gas can be used directly or to create chloride of lime. The boys dyed strips of fabric red and white using this method. The red dye comes from a plant that was historically used for its red color, even turning animal bones red when consumed. This plant has smooth-edged leaves and red flowers. Chicory roots were ground up to make a coffee substitute, providing a bitter tonic. The use of bitter substances for strength is a common human instinct seen in various cultures throughout history.

"As they descended the slope, they couldn't resist turning back repeatedly to admire the flag and the pole, feeling a deep connection to every detail. George, always sentimental, mused, ""I believe our flag is the most beautiful, but others may feel the same about theirs. How did flags originate?""

The recovered back part of the lifeboat helped them understand better. When they landed on the rock, they found the stern lodged in the rocks, but it got dislodged by a wave. Months later, they found it a hundred feet inland. The recovered part was in good shape, but the hull needed work to attach the new bow part. Harry planned to extend the vessel to twenty feet long and six and a half feet wide, with a depth of two and a half feet for security and capacity. They discussed sails and masts, settling on a 150 square feet sail area for safety and ease of use. During a hunting expedition, they found signs of human presence, making them rethink leaving the Cataract.|"4. Where did they find the stern of the boat when they landed on the rock?

After you left, I decided to take a walk towards the cliffs by the sea. The valley and incline beyond caught my attention. The limestone ridge had wide cleavages creating caverns. I explored hoping to find more caves but only found one with a skeleton on a wooden cot. Arrows were scattered around, indicating the man was cast ashore or shipwrecked. There was no clothing or signs of violence on the bones. The arrows suggest he might have been attacked by natives. The decayed state of the arrows and cot indicate the skeleton is quite old. George and I discussed the possibilities, concluding that we need to be prepared to face the challenges of this island.
