Tom had an idea to develop a film on board the ship to show everyone. The captain mentioned a dark room and an officer with a reproducing machine. During the rescue, Tom captured a picture of the captain leaving the burning ship. As the lifeboats approached, he filmed the sailors and rescued passengers. Suddenly, there was a massive explosion on the tramp oiler, which Tom also captured. The rescued passengers were taken care of on the Belchar. Tom showed the films in a saloon using a borrowed machine, charging a dollar for admission. The funds raised helped the unfortunate passengers and crew. After reaching Calcutta, an agent of Mr. Period assisted in assembling the airship. Tom, his companions, and Koku were amazed by the sights in India.

Amid the excited cries of the curious locals and bidding farewell to Mr. Period's representative, Tom and his companions set off early. The Flyer ascended swiftly, soaring over the city as onlookers marveled from rooftops. Tom refrained from using his camera, having already captured many images of the Indian city, including an aerial view. Venturing towards a jungle where elephants were said to roam, the group left the city behind. Eventually, they found themselves flying over the dense jungle. As they adjusted the machinery, the Flyer practically piloted itself. Tom, equipped with his camera and spyglass, eagerly scanned the horizon for elephants. After hours of searching, just as night fell, Ned spotted a herd below. The elephants, driven by hunters towards a stockade, suddenly turned aggressive upon noticing the airship. The chaos unfolded as the elephants charged back into the jungle, causing a frenzy among the hunters and natives.|"1. What did Tom refrain from using during the flight over the city?

The blimp descended low enough for Tom and the others to clearly see the hunters and native helpers.

The process involved rounding up the elephants with tame ones and herding them into a stockade. Tom, Ned, and Mr. Nestor landed and proceeded to the stockade entrance with the camera.

Tom explained that the Flyer was a unique aircraft that combined a dirigible balloon and an airplane. It could function as either or both simultaneously. Currently, the gas bag was not fully inflated, and Tom operated the craft as an airplane. He carried the chemicals needed to produce a powerful lifting gas, which was more potent than hydrogen. Despite the strong wind holding the craft down, the gas machine was pushed to its limit to lift the Flyer. As they ascended, the wind's force lessened, and they reached a calm zone three miles above the earth. Tom adjusted the oxygen apparatus for a comfortable atmosphere inside the craft. After repairing the equilibrium rudder and resuming forward motion with the propellers, they sailed through the night safely above the storm. They landed near Rome to refuel and attracted a crowd of curious onlookers.|"1. What was the unique feature of the Flyer aircraft as explained by Tom?
