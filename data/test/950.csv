To clear his mind, he took his motor-boat, the Arrow, to visit Mr. Damon in Waterfield. On the way, he encountered a familiar girl rowing a boat and offered her a motor-boat. Later, Tom shared his car design ideas with his father and Mr. Sharp, inspired by an airship's structure. He planned to incorporate steel compartments for batteries and other equipment, ensuring minimal wind resistance.|"6. What material did Tom plan to incorporate into his car design for minimal wind resistance?
A) Glass
B) Wood
C) Plastic
D) Steel compartments
E) Aluminum"|D) Steel compartments|Yes
Tom excitedly explained his new invention to his father and Mr. Sharp. He planned to use a chain drive for more power and flexibility, steering it conventionally with starting and reversing levers near the wheel. With gears and a big reserve battery, he aimed for greater speed. After receiving feedback on his sketches, Tom began constructing the car with Mr. Jackson's help. Some parts were bought instead of made to speed up the process. The electric car started taking shape in Tom's shop, focusing on speed, strength, and control over appearance. Meanwhile, Mr. Foger tried to persuade Tom to move his deposit to a new bank, but Mr. Damon promised to help Ned by depositing money in the old bank.|"1.

Tom Swift, the young inventor, was busy preparing for a big race. He decided to use his dad's cottage as his base near the Long Island track where the race would take place. Tom's father mentioned some business in town and offered Tom a ride, but Tom declined, as he had to work on his new car and powerful batteries. Tom had made great progress on his new electric vehicle, which was starting to attract attention. An article in a New York newspaper exaggerated the capabilities of Tom's car, causing a stir and drawing unwanted visitors to the Swift shops. Tom and his father had to warn people to stay away, even resorting to mild electric shocks to deter curious onlookers. Despite some local troublemakers, Tom continued to work on perfecting his car for the upcoming race, where many other inventors were also preparing their electric vehicles.|"1.

After much effort, Tom managed to assemble a set of batteries. Eager to test them that night, he needed a specific powder from his father's lab. Unfortunately, he found none. Determined, Tom left after dinner, recalling past encounters with Andy Foger. Concerned about Andy and Sam Snedecker, Tom set off to get the needed chemical. On his way back, he kept an eye out for a special someone but did not find her. As he rode, several masked figures suddenly blocked his path, demanding him to stop. Surprised, Tom hesitated, causing his motor-cycle to slow down. Unfazed, Tom shone a bright light on the masked group, revealing their faces. Startled, the figures reacted, throwing a stone that shattered Tom's lamp, plunging the road into darkness. Tom prepared to confront the vandals for their actions.|"1.
