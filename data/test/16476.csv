As the steamer neared, the Old Glory showed signs of sinking, prompting everyone to don life preservers. The small boat rescued Sam and Tom, then retrieved Dick and Captain Jerry. Once aboard the tramp steamer, Captain Fairleigh offered dry clothes and a warm meal. The group learned they were bound for Honolulu, with a chance to sail to San Francisco in a week.

To avoid fire risks in high winds, cooking would be done in a shed away from the house, close to the rocks and spring. They decided to take turns cooking and doing housework so the men could hunt, fish, and garden. The exploring party consisted of Captain Blossom, Sam, and Tom, while Dick and old Jerry stayed with the girls.
