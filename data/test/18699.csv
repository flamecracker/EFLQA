A genuine schooner has been acquired for a purposeful shipwreck scene. The vessel, named the _Mary Ellen_, though not in the best condition, will serve well for our needs. Despite the high cost, it is deemed worthwhile for the dramatic storm scenes. The decision to delay the play rehearsal allows us to inspect and familiarize ourselves with the ship's layout. However, a crew member, Jack, reveals his past involvement in a mutiny, leaving him under suspicion and unable to enter English ports. The hope of clearing his name lies in finding the real mutineers or evidence. The _Mary Ellen_ is mentioned, triggering a glimmer of hope that it might be connected to the mutiny, though it is considered unlikely by the manager. The vessel is being readied for filming in Southern waters, with scenes both aboard and around her to be captured. A visit to the ship in Erie Basin is planned to prepare for the upcoming sea drama, with the manager expressing the importance of the DeVere family's involvement despite potential health risks.|"1.
