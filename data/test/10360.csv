My observation isn't as I hoped. I overlook the business district and witness various activities. It's my duty to observe the businessmen, and sometimes I'm truly disappointed. During the war, they were commendable, sacrificing time, money, and even their own kin, and I felt proud. However, many have regressed to their old ways. It seems like their motto now is 'Every man for himself, and the devil takes the hindmost.' Deceit, dishonesty, and corruption are prevalent. There's a lack of integrity in the business world, turning it into a game of chance where luck triumphs over hard work. In the past, people built secure fortunes, enjoyed them, and left behind a good legacy. Nowadays, it's all about money, with health, happiness, and honor being sacrificed in the pursuit of wealth. Dishonest practices lead to grand failures, affecting many, yet the cunning manage to save enough to retire comfortably.

Despite my criticisms, I cherish my children, whom I affectionately refer to as such, for not all are perfect. Many are not swayed by wealth to neglect their duties or harden their hearts. They generously share their abundance, show compassion to the less fortunate, console the afflicted, and bring honor to our city both near and far. They face their own challenges, losses, and sorrows, just like those less fortunate; life isn't always easy for them. Recently, they have been under the tutelage of a warm, talented, and beloved teacher who imparts lessons of kindness, goodwill, and joy through tears and smiles. We all adore him, and his teachings inspire us to be better. Let's hope that his influence touches the hearts of those who listen, encouraging them to extend a helping hand to those in need.|"1.
