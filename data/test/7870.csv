I was certain we descended further down the Ghaut than when I spotted the bears, continuing downwards. However, my knowledge of Hindustani was limited, and I understood none of the women's language. Weakness overwhelmed me, hindering my ability to stand or think clearly. I drifted in and out of consciousness until we halted before a tent. Several old women and men emerged, engaging in animated conversations with the young women who had carried me. Despite some initial tension, calm eventually prevailed, and I was taken inside the tent. Stricken with fever and delirious for days, I later learned I had been unconscious for a fortnight. Thanks to the women's care and my resilient constitution, I gradually recovered. As my strength returned, I attempted to convey to the women that they would be rewarded for informing my camp of my whereabouts. However, they seemed to understand but refused, indicating my status as a captive. Though frustrating, I remained optimistic about escaping, particularly due to the kindness of the young women who had saved me. Just as I was regaining my strength and contemplating an escape, a group of armed men arrived, signaling for me to accompany them. Clearly a planned event, the girls were surprised but quickly ushered out. I was draped in native attire and swiftly escorted away. The journey to our destination, a natural rock fortress, took six hours due to my weakened state. Upon arrival, I encountered a man who appeared to be the chief of the bandits,|"1.

I felt a sudden crash and fell backward, unharmed. The ball had hit the parapet near the guard, covering him with fragments. Unsure of his condition, I pretended to have fallen over the edge. Making it seem like an accident, I dropped my cap outside and ran to the other end of the platform. Waving my arms, I caught the attention of a face in a uniform cap from the jungle below. I signaled for them to come to the rock wall beneath me. Using the guard's turban as a rope, we established a way to communicate. After a tense hour, a rope ladder was lowered, and I held it for the first climber. More followed, and we secured the area. The Dacoits were defeated, and the prisoners faced justice.|"1.
