Storytellers, too, grapple with Time's complexities, skipping over years to focus on essential details.

After a decade, the Fairies decided to check on their charges. They understood that real insights would only come when the children grew older and independent. They found it amusing to see how their enchantments were working. Picture a nursery, much like your own, with children playing. The eldest, a ten-year-old girl, lounges in a rocking chair, her lovely face framed by long eyelashes and chestnut curls. Although her face appeared thoughtful, she was merely in a dreamy state, waiting for a dinner party at half-past six. She was Aurora, admired for her beauty. Seeking approval is common, but focusing too much on what others think can lead to selfishness. Aurora's constant concern about others' opinions hindered her enjoyment of the present. When the clock struck six, she transformed, eager for the party. Seeking self-approval can cloud true happiness.|"1.

"The fairies who watched silently were not as vocal in praising Aurora as humans would have been. They are so beautiful themselves that they don't think much of earthly beauty. Even Ianthe couldn't honestly say, ""What a happy-looking little girl she is."" That was the one thing missing. Even with all the attention and praise, Aurora couldn't fully relax and be happy. Occasionally, a cloud of worry crossed her face, thinking about her appearance.
