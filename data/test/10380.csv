E) The choice of colorful and scented flowers"|C) The thought of offering the flowers to God|Yes
Many of you have brought beautiful flowers to this place today, some to enhance the occasion, some to please your teacher, and others simply to add to the beauty of this gathering. But if, as you worked or brought your flowers, your thoughts turned to God, offering these flowers for His altars, recognizing that the glory of color and scent is not for us but for Him, then every poet, person of fine feeling, and true thinker would agree that this act is more beautiful. It is disheartening to see lives that do not acknowledge God, to witness noble actions and generous emotions devoid of a sense of the divine. I hope that God is in your thoughts, that you confess Him in all your ways, serving, fearing, knowing, and loving Him. This is my wish for you today, and the prayer I offer on your behalf.|"3.
