John entered the cottage and shut the door. Besides the living room, there was a bedroom and a kitchen, all showing signs of recent use. He discovered a small lamp but decided not to light it. Instead, he sat on a wooden bench near a window in the main room, ate a bit more from his knapsack, and kept watch in case a friend or foe approached. As darkness fell and rain began to pour, he felt grateful for finding the shelter. Having spent hours in the river, he was content with the water he had encountered. The wind howled and rain beat against the cottage, but John felt at ease and rested. The sounds of battle in the distance didn't bother him; he was focused on his own well-being. He secured the door, allowing fresh air to flow in through the window. Wrapped in blankets, he found comfort in the storm, feeling reminiscent of home.|"1.

Deciding not to sleep yet, John explored the house further. He found a box of matches near the lamp and lit it to investigate. In the kitchen, he discovered a jar of honey, a common breakfast item in Europe. Among old clothes, he noticed an engraving of young Napoleon, which captivated him. John admired Napoleon as a young general but criticized his later ambitions. Feeling watched by the engraving, he returned downstairs, opened the window to the rain, and heard distant sounds of war. John realized the abandoned cottage was a mere refuge in the chaos of battle. He cautiously scouted the area and spotted military vehicles approaching, manned by elderly German generals. He observed their hardened demeanor, reflecting on the consequences of unchecked ambition.|"1. What did John find near the lamp in the house?

Accident. I stumbled upon a hidden refuge, grateful for its shelter from the elements after standing in the Marne for so long. It was a desolate spot, but with German soldiers passing close by. I spied on them from behind a hedge and recognized a high-ranking enemy, the Prince of Auersperg, a staunch opponent of democracy. My companion, John, suggested using a real tree for signaling instead of the small saplings around. As we bid farewell to the cozy cottage, I reflected on the peaceful hours spent there. Walking alongside the Marne, the distant battle's relentless roar intensified, casting a sense of cataclysm over us. John bravely climbed a tall tree to hoist a flag, offering a vantage point over the quiet countryside amidst the distant echoes of war.|"1.

A woman in a dark dress with a red cross passed by, but it wasn't the singer. Disappointed, he saw a man in a white jacket, likely a surgeon. At home, surgeons wore white.

John heard a low, menacing sound from the east, distinguishing it from thunder and recognizing it as artillery. He had been hearing it continuously during his unconsciousness. He was informed he had been injured by a horse but would recover quickly. A lady's laughter revealed she was the one singing softly earlier. The melody felt like a gentle breeze among roses. John's thoughts turned poetic, possibly due to the concussion. A man remarked on John's recovery, joking about American skull thickness. Despite war's division, it unites people, teaching them similarities. The surgeon would return in two hours for a final bandage change. John was assured Mademoiselle Lannes would care for him, as she watched over him due to his friendship with her brother, Philip Lannes. Antoine Picard, a protective figure, replaced the surgeon, ensuring Julie's safety. John appreciated the feudal loyalty Antoine showed towards her.|"1.

John sat up and flexed his arm to display his strength. Picard smiled and extended his hand for a handshake, American style. He appeared genuinely happy that John had returned to reality, likely because he knew John was a friend of Lannes. Julie exchanged words with Picard, bid John farewell, and departed.

Suzanne, who endeavored to reach a weapon, fought like a tigress, but two Uhlans finally subdued her.

John turned in sudden alarm to Legar√©, who heard also and stiffened at once to attention. They were not alone on the road.

Surrounded by high banks with hedges and willows, the Germans veered into the stream bed instead of following the path. The thunderous sound of artillery filled the air as shells soared overhead.

As they approached a low point in the eastern bank, the carts turned onto a narrow road lined with poplars, continuing eastward.

He gazed at the grand ch√¢teau, reminiscent of a refuge where he, Carstairs, and Wharton once sought shelter. The two-story building with expansive windows sat amidst a park-like lawn, teeming with life that did not belong to its owners. Young officers lounged on the grass, while horses and armored automobiles dotted the grounds. Nearby, field guns lay idle with their slumbering gunners. John sensed the presence of thousands of troops nearby, deep within the German army's heart. The ch√¢teau was enclosed by a tall iron fence, and a group of officers approached the arriving carts.

Despite General Vaugirard's presence, Wharton and Carstairs greeted them warmly. Captain Daniel Colton also acknowledged them. The Strangers were reserved but showed deep emotion.

The night remained illuminated by soft clouds. The only sound was the army's movement, now accompanied by the hum of cars. They approached a stream, and gunfire erupted ahead. French trumpets blared, and the troops advanced swiftly, met by enemy fire. The general's car led the way, and he seemed pleased. As dawn approached, a ch√¢teau appeared on the horizon, engulfed in flames. John's heart raced with fear for those inside. The general calmly observed through his binoculars.
