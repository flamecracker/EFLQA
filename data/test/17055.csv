Captain Jack and an officer were tasked with identifying the two Italians who had ambushed Jack the previous night. Despite rounding up all the workers in the yard, Jack couldn't find the assailants. Benson mentioned the need to remove the automatic closer from the torpedo tube to avoid detection during an upcoming Navy inspection. Meanwhile, Eph regretted missing out on real action while reading about the War of 1812. Jack expressed how having company during the ordeal with the Italians would have been comforting. Mr. Farnum received a telegram about Naval officers arriving for an inspection. Concerns arose about a rival boatbuilder possibly sabotaging their submarine. The boatbuilder declined an offer from the rival builder, as another investor was willing to support their project.
