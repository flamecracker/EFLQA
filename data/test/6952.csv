"""No, you won't, Peters; my place is the place of danger. But if you like you can lie under the bulwark there after you have fired, and be ready to take my place if you see me drop. Now, lads, get ready."" So saying the captain put down the tiller. The Good Venture swept round under the stern of the Spaniard at a distance of some forty yards, and as she did so the guns loaded with bullets to the muzzle were fired one after the other. The effect was terrible, and the galleries and poop were swept by the leaden shower. Then the captain straightened the helm again. The crew burst into the wild yells and cries the beggars raised when going into battle. The Spaniards, confused by the terrible slaughter worked by the guns of their enemies, and believing that they were about to be boarded on the port side by a crowd of desperate foemen, hastily put up the tiller, and the ship bore away as the Good Venture swept up, presenting her stern instead of her broadside to them.

To the momentary relief of the Spaniards their assailant instead of imitating their maneuvers kept straight upon her course before the wind, and instead of the wild cries of the beggars a hearty English cheer was raised.

Always remember, lad, to do a little extra in all you undertake. That extra effort sets you apart and earns the trust and confidence of those who rely on you. Your duty is to ensure their trust is well placed, even if it means a personal loss. So, always think more of others' interests than your own.|"1.

In March 1576, the siege continued as Requesens, the Spanish leader, fell ill and died suddenly. His death was partly due to the stress caused by a mutiny among the troops. The soldiers, after capturing the Island of Schouwen, joined the mutiny and left for Brabant. The situation in Holland worsened, with efforts focused on repairing broken dykes and reclaiming submerged lands. A law was passed to protect animals due to the scarcity caused by the ongoing chaos.

Admiral Boisot's death in a failed attempt to relieve Zierickzee was a significant loss for Holland. Mutinies spread, leading to unrest and violence. The prince advocated for liberty of conscience and religious tolerance. The people of Brabant turned to the provinces resisting Spanish rule for help. Ned Martin, on a mission to Holland, reported back to England on the growing unrest and the potential for a confederation of provinces in the Netherlands.

Sir Edward Martin was in Antwerp when he learned about the prince's murder. He was deeply saddened by the loss of his friend and admired leader. Initially, he feared that the Netherlands' cause was lost with the prince's death. However, the successful defense of their cities and the people's determination brought hope. Unfortunately, there were blunders in preparing for Antwerp's defense. The Admiral of the fleet, Treslong, disobeyed orders, delaying vital supplies. Despite initial despair, the citizens rallied under Sainte Aldegonde's leadership. There were disagreements about strategic decisions, like piercing the dyke. The city's fate was sealed by the prince's death and the burghers' stubbornness.

During the siege of Antwerp, the Duke of Parma strategically positioned fortified posts along the Lower Scheldt, obstructing river navigation. The forts of Lillo and Liefkenshoek, located nine miles below the city, were key points. Liefkenshoek fell to the Spanish forces after a surprise attack, resulting in the loss of its entire garrison. Lillo, defended by Antwerp volunteers and foreign troops, withstood a fierce assault by the Spaniards. Mondragon, leading the siege, faced difficulties breaching the fort's defenses. A failed attempt, coupled with high tides and a counterattack by the defenders, forced the Spanish to retreat, abandoning the siege. Parma's camp opposite Antwerp buzzed with activity as preparations for a prolonged blockade progressed. Despite efforts to supply Antwerp, misguided decisions by the city's authorities halted critical food shipments, exacerbating the looming crisis.|"1.

Ned recounted a chaotic scene at the town hall, where twenty men shouted, ignoring each other while the rest added to the noise. Sainte Aldegonde regretted the lack of a strong leader like the prince to guide them. On the Flemish side, the sluices at Saftingen were opened, flooding the land except for Kalloo and nearby villages. The Lord of Kowenstyn urged cutting the dykes to prevent Spanish advancement, but it was too late. Parma's forces gained an advantage by bringing in supplies through the Scheldt. Despite efforts to resist, Parma's strategic fortifications posed a significant threat. The capture of Teligny was a setback, and Parma eventually called for Antwerp's surrender. The States attempted a diversion at Bois le Duc, but Hohenlohe's troops' greed led to a failed attempt.|"1. What was the reason for the chaotic scene at the town hall described by Ned?

The residents of Antwerp faced a critical situation. Armed vessels from Zeeland, supported by troops from Fort Lillo, successfully recaptured Fort Liefkenshoek and Fort St. Anthony. However, a delay in following orders allowed Parma to reinforce the broken dyke near the bridge, preventing the destruction of the barrier. Despite this setback, the patriots regained control of the river up to three miles from the bridge. Gianobelli, an Italian inventor, proposed a plan to destroy Parma's bridge using ships filled with explosives. Unfortunately, the Antwerp Council only provided two small vessels for this purpose. The plan involved loading the ships with a chamber filled with explosives and heavy materials. The operation, set for April 5th, faced challenges as fireboats were prematurely launched, and the mine ships were detected by the Spaniards. The attempt to destroy the bridge ultimately failed.|"1.
