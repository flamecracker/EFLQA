Frank observed the campfire below, casting a red glow on the tents where Nestor had entered earlier. The situation seemed logical - any of the three men could have committed the crime Fremont was accused of. Two men were in the tent, and the third was expected.

How did the attack on Cameron, the hidden mine, and the international matter relate? Nestor hinted at a secret mission, seeking peace in his country at the risk of war with theirs. The diplomat's failed attempt to buy arms led to suspicions and the missing letters from Cameron. Frank's admiration for the Boy Scouts, represented by his badges, was noted by the officer, who praised the organization for instilling values in youth.|"1.
