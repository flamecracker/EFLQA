Tiny eagerly awaited her father's return home that night. She hoped to accompany him to Fellness to sell samphire, dreaming of visiting the shops and maybe even getting a book if they had a good sale. To Tiny, Fellness was a grand town with bright shops, unlike the small fishing village where they lived. Her friend, Dick, warned her that Fellness had only one shop selling basic goods, no books. Despite this, Tiny was determined to get a book. When she spotted her father's boat approaching, she hurriedly filled the baskets with seaweed. With Dick's help, they carried the baskets to the shore just as her father and brother arrived. Her father, Coomber, promised to get her sweets instead of a book, understanding her desire. As they rowed back, Tiny thought of asking God to bless her family and fulfill her wish for a book.|"4. What did Tiny hope to get in Fellness?

Tiny was a bit let down as the days passed by because her students, Tom and Dick, were losing interest in learning the letters she wrote in the sand or showed on paper. They wanted to know how to put the letters together to form words they could understand. Tiny struggled to overcome this challenge even for herself. She vaguely knew that G O D spelled God but wasn't completely confident to tell Dick. Despite this, Tiny's curiosity grew about what the letters could reveal if she could decode them into words. She spent time tracing the letters and spelling out G O D daily. If the fisherman had been less stubborn in his feud with the farmers, Tiny might have easily resolved the reading difficulty with their help. Dick urged Tiny to ask for assistance from the Hayes children, but Tiny hesitated as she believed it might upset her father. Harry Hayes had a book that caught Dick's attention, but Tiny refrained from approaching them to avoid any conflict.|"1. Why was Tiny feeling let down as the days passed by?
