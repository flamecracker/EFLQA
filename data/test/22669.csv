I am eager to hear that you are doing well on your journey and that the stories about the gold fields are not exaggerated. I may not believe everything I hear, but I am convinced that there is enough gold for those who diligently seek it. Remember, hard work is more reliable than luck.

The soil is poor, and without fertilizers, our harvests suffer. Financially, we struggle with a mortgage and upcoming payments. Walter, nearly thirteen, helps around the farm, and Sarah is a great help to her mother. Though we face challenges, I am grateful for my industrious children. Ferguson suggests a city trip for a break, hoping for better opportunities. Tom and Ferguson plan to leave, causing mixed feelings among the group.
