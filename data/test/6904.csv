"Two days before finding a vessel heading their way, Jack persuaded his father to sway the owners to alter course, letting them and their motorboats off at the Amazon river mouth.

A campfire crackled, and Lyman, the man they mistook for a cowboy, sat nearby. The rest wandered around. Occasionally, an Indian entered the fire's glow, conferred briefly, then vanished.

The firelight illuminated the white planes, standing out vividly against the dark backdrop. Ned realized he couldn't linger there without risking detection by the supposed officers of the small republic he was in conflict with.
