"Although I never saw you, since you died in 1804, I am glad you were one of those Welshmen who opposed the policy of King George III and that you, after coming to America in 1783, were among the first sea captains to carry the American flag around the world. That you knew many of the Free Quakers and other patriots of the Revolution and that they buried you among them, near Benjamin Franklin, is a matter of pride to your descendants. That you were born in Wales and spoke Welsh, as did also those three great prophets of spiritual liberty, Roger Williams, William Penn, and Thomas Jefferson, is still further ground for pride in one's ancestry. Now, in the perspective of history we see that our Washington and his compeers and Wilkes, Barre, Burke and the friends of America in Parliament were fighting the same battle of Freedom. Though our debt to Wales for many things is great, we count not least those inheritances from the world of imagination, for which the Cymric Land was famous, even before the days of either Anglo-Saxon or Norman. Now the Welsh folks in speaking of their good teacher pronounced his name Tafid and affectionately Taffy, and this came to be the usual name for a person born in Wales. In our nurseries we all learned that ""Taffy was a Welshman,"" but it was their enemies who made a bad rhyme about Taffy. Wherever there were cows"|"1. What is the main idea of the passage?

Long ago, in Wales, strong castles stood tall, but no Englishman was safe outside. The Welsh people fought back, forcing the Normans to armor up like lobsters. Even on horseback, they looked like turtles. If a knight fell, he had to be cut out of his metal shell. Fairies gathered to make peace, while even reptiles lived more peacefully. But the beasts of prey approved of the Normans' harsh treatment. Eventually, a Welsh king, Henry Tudor, sat on England's throne. Welsh names often reveal family ties, like Jefferson meaning sister's son. Puck, a peacemaker, sought counsel from ancient creatures. The male eagle sent him to the stag, who lived by an ancient oak. The toad, with golden eyes, directed Puck to the wise owl, the oldest of them all.|"1. What did the Welsh people force the Normans to do during their fights?
