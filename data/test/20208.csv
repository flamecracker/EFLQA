Frank was in danger as a crocodile snapped at him, but a shot from the boat stopped the attack. Jimmie, seemingly resigned, rowed ashore. However, he later risked swimming ashore unharmed. Frank warned that Jimmie should stick with Ned to stay safe on the island. Ned planned to explore the island's interior via a river, but Jack cautioned about the island's wildlife. As they waited, a launch's whistle and gunshots were heard. Ned decided to investigate alone, suspecting the boat may be from China. The boys stayed on the boat as Ned ventured into the jungle.

In the dense Philippine forest, cutting through creepers and vines is essential for progress. The bolo, a heavy knife akin to a machete, is a vital tool for hunters and explorers. Expertly wielded, it becomes a formidable weapon. Jimmie, seeking his patrol leader, navigates through the rain-soaked jungle, pulling himself up steep slopes with trailing creepers. He forges ahead without marking his path, encountering thick cogon grass and marveling at the balete tree's parasitic growth. The forest's unique flora captivates him, from towering plants with seven-foot leaves to thorny rattan thickets. As Jimmie climbs, the vast expanse of the China Sea comes into view. Meanwhile, Ned, also in the forest, searches for Jimmie and deciphers mysterious signals, unaware of the distance between them.|"1.

From the hill, Jimmie looked down into a glade where smoke rose from a fire. He saw people moving about the fire, protected by a canvas from the storm. Nearby, a shelter made of leaves and canvas housed several figures. Jimmie gave up hope of finding Ned or his way back to the boat. He decided to follow the coast to return. Spotting a launch to the east, he changed his plan. He circled the camp to intercept the newcomers. As darkness fell, lights appeared in the launch and the camp. Jimmie, soaked and bitten by insects, waited to observe communication between the two groups. Moving closer, he saw the camp's inhabitants building a shelter. Surprisingly, there were no guards.

Once again, the wolf's howl reverberated in the forest, and this time it was met with an answer a few feet away from the boys. Without any gunshots this time, they assumed their pursuers had gone back to camp. The forest was eerily quiet, making the boys believe their enemies had given up the chase. Hastening their pace, they reached the spot where Ned had stood after leaving the _Manhattan_ in the afternoon. As the rain gradually stopped, glimpses of the moon appeared amidst the swift-moving clouds.

It was past noon when they reached the small bay where they left the _Manhattan_. The bay sparkled in the sunlight, the same beach where they landed before. But the motor boat was nowhere in sight.
