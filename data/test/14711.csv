Lord Hastings explained the advantages of using small motorboats over submarines. He mentioned that motorboats are hard to detect by submarines until they are very close and are difficult targets for torpedoes due to their size and speed. Additionally, motorboats are faster than submarines, giving them an advantage. Lord Hastings highlighted that submarines lack visibility underwater, making it challenging for them to aim accurately. He discussed plans to cruise off the Irish coast with a motorboat fleet, emphasizing the importance of vigilance. The passage described the silent approach of a motorboat named _The Hawk_, equipped with crew members ready for action. Despite the calm night, the crew remained alert, searching the dark waters for any signs of danger.|"1. What advantages did Lord Hastings mention about using small motorboats over submarines?

Jack assisted his friend to stand up. Frank wobbled at first but quickly declared he was ready for anything. They walked to the back of the boat where Edwards and Williams lay.

A huge wave crashed over the boat, soaking everyone. The wind howled, chilling the air. Frank shivered but held on tight. The boat battled the storm for hours, with each wave threatening to capsize it. But Edwards expertly steered through the turmoil. Finally, the storm subsided, and the sun shone brightly. Exhausted, Edwards fainted, leaving the boat adrift. They spotted another distressed boat ahead. They reached safety in a bay and got medical help for Lord Hastings, who only needed rest.|"1.

Jack assisted his friend to stand up. Frank wobbled at first but quickly declared he was ready for anything. They walked to the back of the boat where Edwards and Williams lay.
