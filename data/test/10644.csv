Under Roman rule, native rights did not fare well. Paul, as a Roman citizen, could appeal to Caesar for protection and legal privileges granted by the Empire, not because of inherent human rights. In the Greek and Roman republics, civil rights were only granted to citizens, not to all humans. Slaves, constituting half the population in ancient Rome, had no rights. Rights were bestowed by laws, not by human consciousness. Jefferson likely drew his ideas of equal rights from French philosophers like Rousseau, who emphasized innate rights based on eternal justice. The concept of liberty was more prevalent in Western civilizations, influenced by thinkers like Calvin and Rousseau. The development of liberty among nations is a significant historical topic. The Dutch republic played a key role in shaping American institutions, such as town-meetings and religious toleration. England also contributed significantly to the origins of American institutions, with roots in Anglo-Saxon and Norman history. The English House of Commons became powerful during Edward I's reign, securing rights like originating money bills and controlling taxation. Constitutional government in England dates back to the time of Edward I, with kings' powers being checked by parliamentary laws.|"1.

"In Freeman's ""Norman Conquest,"" it seems that the old English town, or borough, has Teutonic roots. Local self-government was acknowledged, but later controlled by the parish priest and lord of the manor due to papal and feudal influences. The tun-mõt, or town-meeting, persisted in the parish vestry and manorial court. The guild system, as per Kendall, originated early in England, impacting popular liberty through guild meetings of small freemen. Guild law governed towns, allowing the election of magistrates. This transitioned from the old reeve to mayors and aldermen, sending representatives to the shire-moot and later to the king's council. The English yeoman's character, marked by personal independence, patience, energy, and enterprise, influenced the settlement of the American Colonies, notably New England. Their traits, reflecting Anglo-Saxon values, distinguished them from the Normans, embodying a democratic spirit and disdain for Norman dominance. Their Puritan beliefs intertwined with civil liberty, shaping their migration to New England, distinct from Dutch settlers in New York. The English Puritans were more dynamic, public-spirited, and inclined towards progress, albeit with a streak of intolerance. Both English and Dutch settlers shared a commitment to liberty, a love for the sea, commercial ventures, and a respect for education."|"1.

In 1613, the Dutch settled New York (Nieuw Amsterdam) and Jamestown, Virginia was settled by the Elizabethan colonies in 1607. These colonies predated the Pilgrims' arrival in Massachusetts in 1620. While most U.S. histories focus on New England, other regions played vital roles too. New England faced early resistance to tyranny, influencing the sentiment of revolt, union, and independence. The Puritan migration from England to Holland and then to New England brought a love of liberty and a dislike for arbitrary taxation. The settlers established self-governed communities with town meetings, electing magistrates and imposing taxes for public needs. Education was highly valued, with Harvard College founded for ministers. The Puritans aspired to a theocracy based on Calvinistic beliefs. They prioritized education, establishing schools and promoting literacy. The Dutch likely influenced the idea of popular education.|"1. What year did the Dutch settle New York?

The early Colonists of New England established a confederation of towns, each represented in the Legislature, or General Court. This alliance aimed to address common issues, enhance trade, create a legal system, devise defense strategies against hostile Indians, and levy taxes to fund the government.

The people's unrestricted choice of parish ministers and devotion to religious freedom played crucial roles in shaping New England's growth and character. The Colonists, from various backgrounds, shared a commitment to independence, hard work, and political awareness, laying the foundation for their future success.|"1.

Benjamin Franklin gained lasting fame not as a public-spirited citizen, a successful businessman, or a scientific researcher. Instead, his legacy was built on his role as a diplomat and political advisor, coupled with his wisdom and patriotism. Before his diplomatic career, Franklin was well-versed in colonial affairs. He served as postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737, gaining experience that led to his appointment as head of the Colonial Postmaster-General in 1753. Additionally, Franklin's political acumen was honed during his time as a member and clerk of the provincial General Assembly, where he clashed with Governor James Hamilton over taxation issues during the Seven Years' War. Franklin's ability to navigate political disputes and his diplomatic skills led to his appointment as an agent of the Province of Pennsylvania in London, where he advocated for colonial interests. Despite facing challenges in gaining access to influential figures like William Pitt, Franklin's time in London allowed him to network with prominent scientists and thinkers of the time.|"6.

During a harsh winter, soldiers faced extreme conditions as they marched to their winter quarters. Fiske describes how their bare, frost-bitten feet left a trail of blood in the snow. Many lacked blankets and had to sit by fires all night. Cold and hunger led to sickness and deaths due to the lack of straw to insulate them from the frozen ground.

Meanwhile, Gates kept his troops idle at Saratoga instead of aiding Washington. Alexander Hamilton's tact secured the return of Virginia riflemen under Morgan. Washington faced challenges with Gates seeking to undermine him, but with the arrival of Baron Steuben, a Prussian officer, the troops were trained and disciplined. Despite financial difficulties, Washington persisted in building a Continental army. France acknowledged America's independence in 1778, and Sir Henry Clinton succeeded Sir William Howe. The Battle of Monmouth, where Lee's disobedience nearly cost Washington the battle, marked a turning point. Washington's strategic moves forced the British to retreat to New York, while the French fleet's failed attempt to capture Newport led to their departure to the West Indies.|"5.

It was peculiar that the positions of the opposing armies remained much the same as two years earlier. Washington's headquarters were at White Plains on the Hudson, while Clinton's were in New York, overseeing the harbor and nearby heights. With neither army strong enough for successful offensive operations, both generals opted for caution. They fortified their positions and observed each other, leading to a year of little action beyond British raids along the coast. Washington, stationed at Middlebrook, N.J., maintained patience and vigilance. Despite discontent, he focused on army discipline rather than city occupation. The British eyed West Point, a crucial fortress. Benedict Arnold, disillusioned and in debt, sought command there and conspired with the enemy. His treason shocked many, leading to the hanging of Major André. Washington lamented the war's demoralization and the nation's focus on personal quarrels over critical matters.|"1.

War often leads to a decline in morals, especially in countries with a republican government. Profanity, drunkenness, and a lack of concern for financial matters became common vices during this time. This moral decay troubled Washington more than any external threats. Despite facing harsh winters and difficult conditions, Washington remained courageous. However, the widespread moral decline, corruption, and weak government administration weighed heavily on him. The British government's refusal to recognize American independence prolonged the conflict needlessly. The war was not excessively brutal until the British government's obstinacy prolonged it. Despite some atrocities committed by Tories and Indians, prisoners were generally treated fairly. The English generals, like Lord North and the Howe brothers, were not bloodthirsty and sought peace. Eventually, Clinton turned his attention to the South, as other fronts proved too challenging. Washington, unable to be directly involved in Southern operations, focused on defending the North and urging Congress to take stronger action. Congress's inaction left the State governments and the South vulnerable to British raids, which were destructive and cruel. Washington's efforts to defend New York and push for more decisive action from Congress were hindered by their helplessness.|"1. What troubled Washington the most during the war?

In May 1780, Charleston, S.C., was left to the enemy as General Lincoln found it indefensible. In September, news of the battle of Camden and Gates' defeat reached the North. Gates' removal was necessary due to his incompetency. Washington's influence led to Greene succeeding Gates in December 1780. Greene's strategic operations expelled the English from the South.

"In 1761, a pivotal moment occurred in John Adams' life. He was deeply moved by James Otis' powerful speech against the unjust ""writs of assistance"" that allowed British officers to search Colonists' homes for smuggled goods. This injustice fueled Adams' passion for defending the rights of English subjects in the Colonies. When Parliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765, Adams vehemently protested, arguing against taxation without representation. He, along with other impassioned orators, ignited the spirit of liberty among the Colonists. Adams' eloquence and honesty quickly elevated him to a prominent position in the patriotic party. His move to Boston in 1768 coincided with the arrival of British troops, leading to the tragic ""Boston Massacre"" in 1770. This event further fueled the people's resentment towards British oppression.

Scholars and thinkers who prefer quiet contemplation sometimes underestimate the brilliance needed to lead a crowd. Thomas Jefferson, for instance, viewed Patrick Henry as lacking depth. However, despite Henry's limited formal education, legal experts like Wirt, Nicholas, and Jay recognized his exceptional courtroom skills. Even George Washington, a keen judge of character, held Henry in high regard, offering him the Chief-Justice position. Jefferson, who succeeded Henry as Virginia's governor in 1779, faced criticism for his lack of military and executive prowess. His passion lay in intellectual pursuits rather than governance. Despite setbacks, Jefferson's commitment to revolutionary ideals endured, even as he navigated diplomatic waters in France alongside Franklin and Adams. His amiable nature and diplomatic acumen served him well, contrasting sharply with Adams' more confrontational approach. Jefferson's legacy is one of intellectual rigor, diplomatic finesse, and unwavering commitment to his principles.|"1. What did Thomas Jefferson think of Patrick Henry's intellectual depth?

During his time as Chief Justice, Marshall delivered several crucial opinions that established the supremacy of the Constitution over both national and state laws. In the case of Cohens v. Virginia in 1828, the Supreme Court asserted its jurisdiction over state laws that conflicted with federal laws. Marshall emphasized the necessity of a tribunal to interpret the Constitution and laws to prevent conflicting interpretations across states. In McCulloch v. Maryland in 1819, Marshall ruled that the federal government had the power to incorporate a bank and that states couldn't tax or control it. He argued that if an action is legitimate and within the Constitution's scope, all appropriate means to achieve it are constitutional. In Gibbons v. Ogden in 1824, Marshall declared that Congress had the power to regulate commerce among states and protect it from state interference. His landmark decisions continue to shape constitutional law today.|"1. What did Chief Justice Marshall emphasize in the case of Cohens v. Virginia in 1828?

"Marshall's fame as a judge is not solely based on his opinions on constitutional law. While the Supreme Court's decisions on constitutional matters garner more attention, its jurisdiction covers a broad spectrum of subjects. It is important not to limit the court to semi-political questions, but rather expand its reach to include ordinary commercial issues for its safety and longevity. Marshall excelled in constitutional law but faced challenges in other legal domains due to gaps in his early legal education. However, in international law, where reasoning was more straightforward, he showcased the same breadth of thought and originality. Marshall's opinions, especially in international law, were highly regarded and influential, shaping rules of international conduct. His expertise extended to 195 cases involving international law during his judicial tenure, with significant contributions to the field. His groundbreaking opinion in the case of the schooner ""Exchange"" in 1812 set a precedent for the treatment of foreign vessels in friendly ports, establishing the basis of contemporary law on the matter.
