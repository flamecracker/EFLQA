Robert was very interested in the conversation. Charteris had a wealth of knowledge and added his own unique touch to it. He not only knew about the people but also their personal quirks, rivalries, and jealousies. Robert learned that New York was bustling not just commercially but socially too. Family held great importance, and the wealthy landowners who had received vast grants along the Hudson still had feudal rights, exuding pride like noble families in Europe. Class distinctions were strong, with English fashion setting the trend. As they settled down, the display of luxurious clothing and jewelry was remarkable, catching the eye of many British officers. The group Robert was with, led by Master Benjamin Hardy, drew attention. They were a diverse and impressive group, including Edward Charteris, a model of manners, a tall youth, a dignified Indian chief, and the formidable Willet. The gathering was extraordinary, causing whispers of admiration, especially for Robert and Tayoga. Mr. Hardy was pleased by the attention, noting the unique qualities of his companions, including Colonel Brandon and Major Apthorpe.

Robert felt a secret pleasure as he sat in the theater. Even though he was more connected to Albany than New York, he still felt a sense of belonging to the city at the mouth of the Hudson River. The anticipation of the city's future greatness excited him. The play 'Richard III' was about to begin, and Robert was eager. As the curtain rose, he was transported into a world of romance and tragedy created by Shakespeare's powerful words. The actors, Hallam and his wife, held the audience captive with their skilled performances. Robert was completely absorbed in the play, forgetting everything around him. The influence of the tragedy on Tayoga, an Onondaga with a unique perspective, was as profound as on Robert. Tayoga felt a sense of pride in his heritage, believing that his people governed better than the English nobles. As the play unfolded, Robert noticed a man in the audience who bore a striking resemblance to himself, but dismissed it as unlikely.|"1. What was Robert's initial feeling as he sat in the theater?

Robert was initially convinced that the man sitting near the door was St. Luc, a romantic and adventurous figure. He positioned himself between Tayoga and the man, trying to shield St. Luc from recognition.

A leveled pistol made him stop, then he slid down a rope into a boat. The sailors cut the rope, leaving Robert alone on the schooner.
