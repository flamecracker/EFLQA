Each group would have two days to conduct a detailed geological survey of a specific area previously examined by Mr. Thayer. The scouts were to observe various aspects such as the size of the land, soil quality, hills' height, valleys' extent, vegetation growth, stratified zones, mineral deposits, and any other details specified by Mr. Thayer in his geological survey lessons.

Additionally, a scoring system would be put in place to credit the patrols for their achievements during the training. The group with the highest score would earn the title of Official Geological Surveyors to the Troop.

The lieutenant explained the initial plan for the two weeks of study, which was just a starting point. After that, the patrols would be divided into four groups of geological surveyors. Each group would have two days to conduct a detailed geological survey of a specific area previously examined by Mr. Thayer.
