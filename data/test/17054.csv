Jacob Farnum carefully adjusted the submarine as it descended beneath the water's surface. The deck outside vanished from view as the boat's bow dipped, causing everyone to struggle to stay upright. With water filling the forward diving tanks, the submarine lurched downward like sliding down a slope. Farnum quickly opened other tanks' sea-valves to stabilize the boat, bringing it to a depth of forty feet. Despite the eerie darkness, the crew adapted to the sensation of moving smoothly underwater. Some felt nervous, but Jack Benson remained calm, eager to see how the submarine would resurface. The crew improved the air quality inside using a clever system, alleviating the tense atmosphere.|"1.

The builder, with confidence, believed they would resurface soon. Using a large compressed air container, they forced water out of the tanks. He showed a special wrench, designed for maximum force with minimal effort. Little did they know the wrench would play a crucial role later. David Pollard invited them to see for themselves. Eph, eager, tripped but quickly recovered. The gasoline motor started, engines throbbed, and the submarine moved. Jack stood by the wheel as they skimmed the ocean's surface. The searchlight revealed a sloop's hull with two men clinging to it. They seemed reluctant to be rescued. Benson found it odd and prepared to help.

The elderly man effortlessly navigated the water, aided by his life preserver. With one hand clutching his satchel, he used the other to pull himself along a slightly drooping rope.

Jack Benson, full of confidence, expressed his belief in the submarine's capabilities to Navy officers. As the meal ended, Captain Jack guided the submarine under the starlit sky. The gentle breeze and calm waters made the night pleasant. Moving at twelve miles per hour, the submarine maintained an exhilarating speed. Jack pointed out Point Villars light, suggesting a dive near it for reference. He highlighted the evolution of handling boats, noting the ease of transitioning from smaller to larger vessels nowadays. The crew prepared for a dive, adjusting the submarine's position and depth. Jack remarked on the crew's improved comfort with submersion. The monotony of underwater travel set in, with little to see beyond the submarine's interior. To pass the time, Farnum shared jokes, but soon realized the need for a different distraction due to boredom.|"1. What did Jack Benson express to Navy officers about the submarine's capabilities?
