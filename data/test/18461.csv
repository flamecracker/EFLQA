Philly, Alice, or Frane, Junior, wouldn't have ventured out at night like Russ and Rose Bunker did. The Armatage children's close bond with the plantation's residents made them believe in ""ha'nts"" or ghosts. Russ and Rose, on the other hand, viewed such tales as fairy stories. As they approached the burned cabin, a chilling screech echoed from the woods, causing the siblings to tremble. Despite the initial fright, they continued to set up signs for Sneezer Meiggs. Another shriek, sounding like a distressed woman, sent shivers down their spines. Determined to help, Russ suggested guiding the woman to safety."|"1.
