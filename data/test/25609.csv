I made a boat, a town, a sea, For I am small as small can be. The little hills seemed big to me, I named each cavern, hill, and tree. Sparrows sang songs overhead, Minnows swam in waters spread. Bees hummed tunes as they flew by, Swallows soared in the sky so high. I ruled this world, a tiny king, Where nature danced and birds would sing. No wider plains, no deeper seas, No kings but me, just buzzing bees. Until my mother's voice would call, And dusk would start to gently fall. Home to tea, I had to go, Leave my realm, my rivers' flow. The nurse, so grand, as I drew near, The world so vast, my home so dear.|"1. What did the speaker create in their imaginative world?

In a magical land of play, I sail through the skies when I close my eyes. Clover-tops become trees, and rain-pools transform into seas. Leaves sail like tiny ships on trips, while the Bumble Bee hums high above. I wander freely, watching spiders, flies, and ants march down grassy streets. Sitting on sorrel, I observe ladybirds and climb jointed grass to see swallows pass by. As the sun rolls overhead, I see my reflection in a rain-pool, where leaflets become boats and thoughtful creatures watch me sail. When I open my eyes, I return to reality, surrounded by big people and familiar rooms. Yet, I long to be a sailor on the rain-pool sea, a climber in the clover tree, before heading back to bed after my adventures.|"1.
