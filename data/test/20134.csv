The following day and the days that followed were filled with happiness for Bunny Brown and his sister Sue. They played with their friends, waded in the water, sailed toy boats, and built sandcastles. Sometimes, while relaxing on the beach, Bunny would gaze back at the dense green clusters of evergreen trees that surrounded Christmas Tree Cove.
