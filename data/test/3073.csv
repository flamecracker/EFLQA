The final chapter recounts the tale of James Adair, one of the earliest traders. Did his bold confrontations with corrupt officials and rum sellers, done publicly and in print, lead to such animosity that his memory was forgotten? Perhaps. However, his own book tells us all we need to know about him. It is the story of a man who lived a full life, served his time, and faced death fearlessly. The Appalachian peaks were not the only obstacles that prevented settlers from following the trader's caravans into the valleys beyond. The French controlled the land over the hills, and their hostility, shown through savage attacks, halted the frontiersmen. The conflict between Autocracy and Democracy emerged in the eighteenth century, culminating in the Seven Years' War, where France lost in Europe and relinquished India and Canada. The dispute between France and England over the Ohio Valley was a pivotal event that ignited the war. French and English claims clashed, leading to a conflict that changed the course of history.|"1.

North Carolina, the only colony that hadn't raised false hopes, contributed £12,000 and formed two companies for the war. One of these, led by Edward Brice Dobbs, included a young Daniel Boone as a wagoner. Boone befriended John Findlay, a future guide, and narrowly escaped during Braddock's defeat. Meanwhile, southern tribes were quiet but leaned towards the French due to Governor Glen's misguided Indian policy. His actions, like trying to remove settlers and making false promises, angered the Cherokees. Glen's festival with the Cherokees backfired, leading to a tragic incident where friendly chiefs were killed. Governor Lyttleton's actions further escalated tensions, resulting in the killing of 26 chiefs and igniting the Indian war. The conflict in the Back Country saw many brave men like Hugh Waddell, a skilled fighter appointed by Governor Dobbs, who became a prominent figure in North Carolina's military.|"1.

For nearly three years, terror engulfed the land. Cabins burned, fields lay waste, and many settlers fled as women and children faced slaughter or capture. The Cherokees eventually surrendered after enduring unimaginable horrors. In 1761, they signed a treaty with the English, pledging peace. By 1760, the English triumphed over New France, securing control over key territories. English troops, including Hugh Waddell's rangers, played a crucial role in capturing Fort Duquesne. Despite harsh conditions, the troops pressed on and learned from a captured French Indian that the French had abandoned the fort. With the French defeated and Indian allies gone, the path was clear for English pioneers to explore and settle the Ohio Company's land. This marked the dawn of a new era of westward expansion and commonwealth building.|"1. What event marked the beginning of a new era of westward expansion and commonwealth building?

"Some authors have questioned the authenticity of Logan's speech, suggesting that Gibson might have written it, especially due to the biblical references in the initial lines. However, Adair notes similarities in Indian and biblical expressions, indicating that the core idea is Indian, focusing on sharing food with the less fortunate. The phrase ""There remains not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature"" is a genuine Indian sentiment. The final four lines of the speech seem to be the most faithfully translated, capturing the essence and rhythmic flow of Indian poetry. George Rogers Clark endorsed the speech's authenticity and Cresap's innocence in a letter to Dr. Samuel Brown in 1798. The army that had conquered the land started their journey home by rivers and trails in groups, with provisions arranged along the way to sustain them.

"Some authors have questioned the authenticity of Logan's speech, suggesting that Gibson might have written it, especially due to the biblical references in the initial lines. However, Adair notes similarities in Indian and biblical expressions, indicating that the core idea is Indian, focusing on sharing food with the less fortunate. The phrase ""There remains not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature"" is a genuine Indian sentiment. The final four lines of the speech seem to be the most faithfully translated, capturing the essence and rhythmic flow of Indian poetry. George Rogers Clark endorsed the speech's authenticity and Cresap's innocence in a letter to Dr. Samuel Brown in 1798. The army that had conquered the land started their journey home by rivers and trails in groups, with provisions arranged along the way to sustain them. Daniel Boone, now Captain Boone, took care of the weary and hungry men on the Kentucky route, fulfilling his desire to pave the way through the wilderness for his neighbors. Meanwhile, a land promotion scheme by the Transylvania Company in North Carolina, led by Judge Richard Henderson, aimed to establish a colony in Kentucky.

The defense of Boonesborough was crucial for the safety of Kentucky. If Boonesborough had fallen, Harrodsburg would not have been able to withstand the British and Indian attacks. This victory allowed George Rogers Clark to conduct successful campaigns that helped secure the Northwest from British control. Virginia recognized Captain Daniel Boone's efforts by establishing Boonesborough as a town for traders in 1779. Despite declining a trustee position, Boone's name remained prominent as part of the leadership in Kentucky.

In 1782, George Rogers Clark led two expeditions into enemy territory, destroying Indian towns. During the second mission, his cousin Joseph Rogers, who had been adopted by the Indians, was mistakenly killed by Clark's men. Accompanying Clark were Boone and Harrod.

He had spent all his resources on military campaigns, receiving only a land grant as recognition. As Clark's health declined, he faced financial hardships and alcoholism, eventually receiving a meager pension.

Gentlemen Isaac Thomas, William Falling, Jaret Williams, and another have just arrived after escaping from the Indians. They reported that six hundred Indians and whites plan to attack and take control of the area up to New River. Tradition says Isaac Thomas was warned by Nancy Ward, a Cherokee prophetess, who was friendly to the whites. The Indians were incited to fight by Alexander Cameron and John Stuart, British agents among the overhill tribes. A letter signed by Cameron mentioned a plan involving fifteen hundred Cherokee and Creek warriors joining British troops against the southern colonies. Although John Sevier received a mysterious letter containing military information, he did not share it with the Virginia Committee. Recent findings reveal that forged letters were used to incite unrest among the back settlements of the Carolinas. Both British and American forces sought to involve the Indians in the War of Independence, using them as potential warriors. While massacre was not part of the plan, individual officers may have condoned it. The Indians, once on the warpath, acted independently, regardless of nominal command. Both sides attempted to enlist Indian support, with varying degrees of success.|"1.

When Virginia voided Richard Henderson's vast purchase but granted him a substantial area on the Cumberland, she did not deter the bold pioneer. Henderson's brief tenure in Kentucky was not without merit. He realized that colonies required less economic pressure and more respect for individual freedom to remain loyal to a distant King or a local leader. He planned to colonize Transylvania within North Carolina's borders along the Cumberland River. James Robertson, a man of resource and leadership, was chosen to lead settlers into middle Tennessee. Robertson's journey, along with other white men and families, to settle in present-day Nashville involved navigating unknown waters, enduring harsh winters, and facing dangers from both nature and hostile encounters. Robertson's leadership and the courage of the settlers, including pioneer women, are vividly captured in Captain Donelson's logbook, showcasing the spirit of those who paved the way westward.|"1.
