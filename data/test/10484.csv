Ancient governments and laws varied in their approach to justice and welfare for all classes. Oriental laws and priestly jurisprudence often favored the ruling elite rather than the people. In contrast, Greek and Roman laws, developed through centuries of experience, aimed to benefit all citizens.

The laws of Athens saw significant changes after the democratic party, led by Cleisthenes, gained power. The political rights were extended to all free native Athenians. The military command was now in the hands of ten generals, one from each tribe, instead of one archon. The Ecclesia, a formal gathering of citizens, met more often. Citizens served as jurors, and all were eligible for magistracy. Ostracism, a form of exile without disgrace, was used to prevent the rise of demagogues.

"The Roman Senate was a powerful and esteemed body, composed of aristocrats who held both judicial and legislative authority. Senators were required to be wealthy and wore a purple stripe as a badge of distinction. They oversaw religious matters, foreign relations, troop levies, tax regulations, and the appointment of governors. The Senate also had the power to declare war, appoint dictators, and grant triumphs to victorious generals. The balance of power between the aristocratic Senate and the plebeians gradually shifted with the institution of tribunes, leading to a mixed constitution. The Roman constitution, evolving over centuries, was a remarkable example of human wisdom, with checks and balances preventing absolute power. The people were able to secure and retain rights, gradually gaining more privileges until they became a significant political force. Despite challenges from demagogues like Catiline and Caesar, the Roman Republic stood strong for centuries, symbolized by the proud ""SPQR"" on their standards."|"1.

During the Roman Empire, the constitution was undermined, leading to a consolidated despotism. The emperors held all major offices and controlled the senate, army, law courts, provinces, and taxation. Despite this, the emperors maintained some legal structures and improved jurisprudence. Roman legal science aimed at justice and fairness, and the laws created by the Republic and Empire greatly influenced civilization. The Twelve Tables formed the basis of Roman law, later expanded by the praetors, consuls, tribunes, and senate decrees. The legal system became complex, with lawyers using subtleties and fictions in court. Notable jurists like Gaius and Ulpian laid the groundwork for Roman jurisprudence, which was further developed under imperial rule. Julius Caesar and Augustus introduced just laws, with Augustus focusing on slave manumission and marriage regulations. Ultimately, the emperors replaced the senate as the primary source of legislation.|"1.

"During a prosperous era of Roman law, many writings were crafted on legal matters, but most have been lost over time. Among the surviving works, the Institutes of Gaius stand out as highly valuable, shedding light on previously obscure legal aspects. Notable jurists like Gaius, Ulpian, Paulus, and others from Trajan to Alexander Severus left enduring contributions that became legal cornerstones. Following a period of stagnation, Theodosius II compiled constitutions from Constantine to his time, known as the Theodosian Code, influencing early Germanic laws. However, it was Justinian who revolutionized Roman jurisprudence. He consolidated diverse laws into the Code, then tasked Tribonian to compile the Digest, a collection of legal extracts. The Institutes served as an introduction to these works, while Justinian's Novels introduced new legal ordinances, collectively forming the ""Corpus Juris Civilis."""|"1.

The Roman legal system had specific rules regarding the transfer of property. For property to change ownership, the owner needed to consent to the transfer for a valid reason and physically deliver the item to the new owner. Possession of movable items was considered proof of ownership unless proven otherwise. Ownership of movable items could be acquired through possession for one year and immovable items for two years. Inheritance laws dictated that when a Roman citizen passed away, their property was inherited by their heirs according to a legal order if no will was left behind. The testator, the person making the will, had to be of a certain age and mental capacity, and the will had to be witnessed by Roman citizens. Over time, laws were introduced to limit extreme bequests in wills. The Roman legal system also covered contracts comprehensively, influencing modern legal systems like those of France and Scotland.|"1.

In ancient times, contracts were perfected by spoken words or writings. Verbal agreements were binding when certain formal words were spoken by one party and answered by the other. In England, all guarantees had to be in writing. Written acknowledgments of debt were used, especially for borrowing money. However, a creditor couldn't sue on a note within two years without proving the money was actually paid. Acts causing harm obligated the wrongdoer to make amends, even for damages due to negligence. In cases of libel or slander, truth could be used in defense. If damage occurred maliciously, the responsible party had to provide compensation. Professionals working beyond their expertise were liable for any resulting harm. Owners were responsible for damages caused by their slaves or animals. Legal claims could be transferred, but the assignee couldn't demand more than they paid for the debt. The king initially decided civil cases, later delegated to consuls and praetors. The praetor, assisted by a council, presided over civil courts. Judges were appointed to determine facts and give judgments based on the law. The centumvirs, a tribunal elected annually, decided property disputes. The Romans lacked modern judges, with magistrates serving judicial duties. Legal assessors were introduced to assist in legal matters. Under the empire, the Emperor became the supreme judge, assisted by various magistrates and senators.|"1.

In ancient Rome, crimes against individuals led to severe punishments. Acts like wilful murder, poisoning, and parricide were punishable by death. Adultery resulted in banishment and loss of property, with Constantine even making it a capital offense. Rape was met with death and property confiscation. Forgery, coining base money, and perjury carried arbitrary punishments. Robbery, theft, and damage to property were private matters not penalized by the State. The Romans believed crimes were extinguished after twenty years without accusation. The Roman laws evolved over time, with emperors increasing punishment severity. Fines were common, and imprisonment was rare. Banishment was a frequent penalty, and death penalties included hanging, scourging, and beheading. Slaves were crucified, and under the emperors, execution methods included burning alive and exposure to wild beasts. The criminal justice system became more just and enlightened with time, with the principles of equity gaining importance.|"1. What was the punishment for wilful murder in ancient Rome?

Forgery, coining base money, and perjury carried arbitrary punishments. Robbery, theft, and damage to property were private matters not penalized by the State. The Romans believed crimes were extinguished after twenty years without accusation. The Roman laws evolved over time, with emperors increasing punishment severity. Fines were common, and imprisonment was rare. Banishment was a frequent penalty, and death penalties included hanging, scourging, and beheading. Slaves were crucified, and under the emperors, execution methods included burning alive and exposure to wild beasts. The criminal justice system became more just and enlightened with time, with the principles of equity gaining importance.|"3. What was the penalty for rape in ancient Rome?

These temple-caves boasted facades in the form of arches, adorned with sculptures that adorned both the interiors and exteriors. The _viharas_ were monasteries with central halls surrounded by monk cells, each with an image of Buddha. These edifices, some housing thousands of priests, were adorned with elaborate pillars and sculptures. The Nalanda monastery, for instance, accommodated ten thousand priests and was a hub of learning and art. Later, during the Mohammedan conquest, India saw the rise of mosques, minarets, and palaces that reflected a blend of Greek and Indian influences, showcasing a unique splendor. However, it was the ancient Greeks, particularly the Dorians, who perfected architectural art with their Doric temples, characterized by grandeur, simplicity, and harmony.|"6.

The Doric order of architecture was favored in European Greece and its colonies for a millennium. It was primarily used in temple construction, with examples like the grand structures in Paestum, Sicily, and Athens showcasing its magnificence. Each Doric temple, while following a general style, was unique in its own right. The earlier Doric style was more massive, while later versions became more elegant and adorned with sculptured decorations. The Parthenon, a prime example of Doric architecture, still stands as a testament to its beauty and grandeur. The Ionic order, more graceful and intricate, was invented by the Asiatic Greeks and is exemplified in the Acropolis. The Corinthian order, introduced later, surpassed both Doric and Ionic in refinement and elegance, featuring columns with foliated capitals inspired by acanthus leaves.|"1.

During the flourishing era of Greek architecture from Pericles to Alexander, lasting 113 years, the art evolved through various conquests. The Macedonian conquest brought more grandeur and less simplicity. Subsequently, the Roman conquest hastened a decline in taste, mixing different architectural orders. The Romans, influenced by the Greeks, adopted the Corinthian style, adding more ornamentation. They combined Etruscan arches with Greek columns to create a new architectural style. The Romans, enamored with novelty, lost the simplicity of the Doric style. They altered the Doric columns, used bases, and changed the capitals. Roman temples often had porticos on one front only, projecting three columns. They favored circular temples like the Pantheon with unique internal columns. Roman architecture was criticized for excessive ornamentation and a focus on interior decoration over exterior. Despite these criticisms, Roman architecture showcased grandeur and magnificence through massive structures with columns and arches.|"1. What architectural style did the Romans adopt from the Greeks?

Dionysius and Mikon were famous painters who lived during the same time as Polygnotus. Dionysius was known for his portraits, which lacked idealism but excelled in expression and elegant drawing. Mikon, on the other hand, was skilled in painting horses and was the first to use light Attic ochre and black made from burnt vine-twigs as colors. Apollodorus of Athens, a painter around 408 B.C., added dramatic effect to Polygnotus' style while maintaining his influence. Apollodorus aimed to create realistic depictions, focusing on proper gradation of light and shade. He also introduced chiaro-oscuro and the concept of _tone_ in painting.

Ancient Rome had an abundance of remarkable paintings, yet they did not contribute to the advancement of the art. Sir Joshua Reynolds believed that Greek art had already reached its pinnacle in painting and statuary. Despite this, the Romans greatly valued the works of Greek artists, similar to how the English appreciate the paintings of old masters from Italy and Flanders. The Romans did not innovate in art but provided significant support, leading to a flourishing art scene during the time of the emperors. The Greeks focused on historical and mythological themes, portraying gods, heroes, and emotional human figures to achieve ideal beauty. In contrast, the Romans favored portrait, decorative, and scene painting, which drew criticism from some scholars. Mosaic work eventually replaced painting in Rome, showcasing intricate designs and colors. The ancients excelled in architecture, sculpture, and painting, setting timeless standards that continue to inspire modern artists.|"1. What type of art did the Greeks primarily focus on?

Astronomy, the study of celestial bodies, has a rich history dating back to ancient times. The Chaldeans and Egyptians, among others, were early astronomers who observed and recorded the movements of the stars and planets. The Chaldean shepherds, under the clear skies of Chaldaea, tracked eclipses and established cycles that laid the foundation for astronomy. The Egyptians, through their observations, determined the length of the year and studied the courses of planets. While the Chinese and Hindus also made significant contributions to early astronomy, it was the Greeks who elevated it to a true science. They learned from the Babylonians and Egyptians but surpassed them in developing astronomy as a systematic field of study. The Greeks rejected the mystical and superstitious elements often associated with ancient Eastern astronomy, focusing instead on scientific inquiry and observation.|"1.

The early Greeks had primitive and inaccurate astronomical beliefs until the time of Hipparchus. Homer viewed the earth as a flat circle with a solid dome-like heaven above. This belief persisted until Herodotus' time, five centuries later. They thought the sun, moon, and stars moved on the inner surface of the heavenly dome, and the ocean encircled the earth. The Greeks personified the sun as a divine charioteer. They lacked an understanding of the ecliptic and had no common era for dating. Thales, an early Greek philosopher, made significant astronomical contributions, including determining the year's length and calculating eclipses. Anaximander, another philosopher, focused on planetary magnitudes and distances. While their ideas seem outdated today, they laid the foundation for future astronomical knowledge.|"1.

However, their understanding of the universe was limited, with beliefs that heavenly bodies orbited the Earth and that the Earth was flat. Socrates, a philosopher, focused on human actions rather than celestial bodies, viewing speculations about the stars and planets as futile. Pythagoras introduced the idea that the sun was the center of the universe, although his theories lacked scientific rigor. Despite their shortcomings, these early astronomers laid the groundwork for future scientific exploration.|"1. What is the main focus of Socrates as mentioned in the passage?

Aristarchus, an ancient astronomer, challenged the common belief that the Earth was at the center of the universe. He proposed a heliocentric theory, suggesting that the Earth orbits the Sun. Although he lacked concrete evidence for his theory, he made significant contributions to astronomy. Archimedes and Eratosthenes, other prominent figures, further advanced astronomical knowledge. Eratosthenes accurately calculated the Earth's circumference, a remarkable achievement for his time. The School of Alexandria, where these scholars resided, became a center for astronomical discoveries. Hipparchus, a key figure from this school, laid the foundation for modern astronomy by developing methods to predict eclipses and accurately determine the positions of stars.

Astronomy did not advance for three centuries, despite improved methods. Posidonius built an orrery showing the daily movements of the sun, moon, and five planets. He calculated the earth's circumference differently than Eratosthenes. From Hipparchus to Ptolemy, little progress was made due to lack of precise timekeeping tools, imperfect tables, and no telescopes. Greek astronomers' theories were grand but limited without telescopes. Julius Caesar reformed the Roman calendar, adding days to correct it. He worked with astronomer Sosigines to make the calendar a civil matter, based on the sun. Romans used sun-dials and water-clocks to measure time until the twelfth century when clocks were invented. Ptolemy, the last ancient astronomer, believed in a stationary Earth within a rotating celestial sphere. He did not support the heliocentric theory.|"1.

In ancient times, men sought excitement in the circus and theatre, forsaking the sanctities of married life and the companionship of women.

In the ancient Roman society, women were often depicted negatively by Juvenal, painting them as deceitful and degrading. While his portrayal may have been exaggerated, it highlighted the lack of virtue in many women of that time, except for those who embraced Christianity. The virtues of notable Christian women like Perpetua and Felicitas contrasted with the common behavior of most women who were often victims or slaves, seeking revenge through betrayal and deceit. Additionally, the gladiatorial shows and festivals in Roman society were a major source of entertainment but also desensitized people to violence and cruelty. These events, such as gladiator fights and animal hunts, captivated the public's attention and diverted them from more intellectual pursuits, contributing to a culture of excess and bloodshed. The grand spectacles in arenas like the Circus Maximus and the Amphitheatre of Titus attracted massive crowds, further fueling a society obsessed with violent entertainment and lavish displays.|"1.
