Kingdon diligently worked to organize the paper with contributions from the club members, Mr. and Mrs. Maynard, and himself. Using his small typewriter, he painstakingly transcribed the contributions onto clean white pages. Hester's illustrations were added, and the pages were bound with a red cover, decorated by Hester with a yellow sand-pail emblem and tied with a yellow ribbon. The first issue of _The Jolly Sandboy_ was a visually stunning creation. Hester wore a witch costume that impressed everyone with its red skirt, yellow shawl, and tall black hat adorned with red and yellow ribbons. The boys sported various costumes featuring red jerseys and yellow sashes, while King donned a mantle slung over one shoulder, completing the courtly look with badges, orders, and lances wrapped in gilt paper. Marjorie, seated on a throne adorned with flowers, warmly addressed the court, introducing the Sand Piper as the publisher of the court journal. King, as the headitor, delivered an editorial promising to report on the court's activities and the local news, concluding with a vow to aspire to the presidency. The journal reported on the Queen and her lady-in-waiting's ocean adventure, where they were playfully knocked over by a wave, prompting a swift rescue by the court members.
