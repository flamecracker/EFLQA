"""No, my dear, you misunderstand me. It's not crucial for my current task to know where Colonel Weatherby is residing. I'm simply seeking pertinent details, information that you can provide,"" explained Agatha. ""I was there when you discovered it. I noticed your surprise and confusion as you read the note and looked at Mary Louise. You chose not to show her the letter to spare her, but you inadvertently mentioned that it referred to her mother and, more significantly, her grandfather.""

""Colonel Weatherby is a mysterious man. He has evaded Government agents for nearly a decade. The Government is thorough in its investigations, yet they haven't caught him,"" Agatha continued, her tone serious. ""That's why I've come to you. I'm working for undisclosed parties to unravel this mystery and clear Colonel Weatherby's name. You possess crucial information, but due to your circumstances, you can't act alone. I offer to be your ally in this endeavor.""

Irene, sensing Agatha's manipulative tactics, hesitated before responding. She knew she couldn't outwit Agatha. ""Colonel Weatherby knows more about his situation than I do. He chooses not to defend himself, even though he could. I won't betray any information I unintentionally stumbled upon. For Mary Louise and her grandfather's sake, I urge you to stop prying.""

Agatha, realizing her failure, conceded, ""Our partnership ends here. I won't betray any secrets"|"6. How does Agatha respond to Irene's refusal to cooperate?

The talk between Miss Lord and Irene did not touch on the letter or Colonel Weatherby. They conversed on other topics, maintaining a friendly facade. Irene felt she had revealed too much but kept the truth about the Colonel hidden. The letter was safely stashed away, challenging even Miss Lord to find it. Reflecting on this, Irene checked her hiding spot, finding the letter secure. Unaware, she missed a face at the window. Later, in the afternoon, Sarah Judd, the servant, discovered the letter in Will Morrison's rifle stock. She made a copy in shorthand and left a note on a blank paper.
