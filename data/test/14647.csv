Fred had found a comfortable spot to rest. He decided to relax and enjoy the much-needed break. When a person is extremely tired, it's hard for them to think about anything else. After being tormented by fears, once Fred stopped moving, he felt a sense of relief and longed for rest. As he closed his eyes, he saw dancing lights and heard strange noises. He felt impish figures playing around him. Eventually, he fell into a deep, dreamless sleep that refreshed him. Suddenly, he woke up to an animal licking his face. Startled, he realized it was the wolf he had encountered before. Instead of shooting it, he decided to wait and see what would happen.

Human skeletons and animal remains served as grim reminders of the violence that had occurred in the pass.
