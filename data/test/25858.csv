My role was to update on the fire's progress. Even when contained in one area, it would flare up in another. Through messages from my plane to the ground crew stationed near the fire line, we directed the men to the danger spots. As the fire seemed under control on one side, I sent the crew to tackle the blaze on the other side. However, as soon as they dispersed, the fire reignited, and we had to call back half the team. It was a tough battle, but with the help of the trusty wireless communication, we eventually succeeded. The use of wireless-equipped airplanes has become crucial for the Forest Service, akin to how ships are vital for the navy. In the past, relying on regular telephones for fire warnings was unreliable due to fires destroying phone lines, leaving the Forest Service blind.|"Question 5:
