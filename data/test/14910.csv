""I want to show you the German castle,"" said Harold. ""It's a replica of a medieval castle on the Midway Plaisance. Most find it intriguing, resembling moat-surrounded castles from old tales.""

Early in the morning, the British ship Carnation tried to attack the Armstrong, but the American gunners fought back fiercely. The Carnation was badly damaged and had to retreat. The British suffered over 300 casualties, while the Americans only had two killed and seven wounded. To prevent the Carnation from falling into enemy hands, Captain Reid ordered the Armstrong to be scuttled, which means making holes in the ship to sink it. Even after the Americans left the ship, the British tried to board it but ended up setting it on fire. The defense of the Armstrong delayed the British squadron's journey to Jamaica, where they planned to attack New Orleans. The delay allowed General Jackson to reach the city and prepare its defense. Captain Reid's ingenious plan to modify the American flag, adding a star for each new state, was adopted by Congress. His bravery at Fayal and Jackson's defense of New Orleans against a powerful British force showed the strength of the American spirit.|"1.
