In the Jungle, there is a Law that forbids killing at watering holes during the Water Truce. This rule exists because water is essential for survival, even more than food. All animals in the Jungle must come together at the same water source when it is scarce, putting a pause on hunting. In the past, coming to drink at the Waingunga or any other place was risky, adding excitement to the night's activities. However, during the Water Truce, all hunting stops, and the animals, including tigers, bears, deer, buffaloes, and pigs, gather around the shrunken river, exhausted and hungry. Mowgli, a young boy living in the Jungle, visits the Peace Rock nightly for water and solace. Despite his lean appearance, he remains calm and takes advice from Bagheera to hunt carefully and keep his temper in check.|"1. What is the purpose of the Law mentioned in the passage?

Mowgli slipped in silently, dived across, and floated on his back, watching the moon above the rocks. Kaa's head cut the water like a razor, resting on Mowgli's shoulder.

It's better in the Jungle."" ""Not all,"" said Mowgli. ""Else there would be a new Shere Khan every month. We all feel this way,"" he continued. Kaa mentioned dealings with the Poison People, and a hooded creature they encountered. They set off for Cold Lairs, the deserted city. Mowgli wasn't afraid of the Monkey People, but they feared him.

The White Cobra was correct. No amount of money could match the worth of the treasure, a collection amassed over centuries from war, plunder, trade, and taxes. The coins alone were invaluable, not to mention the precious stones. The sheer weight of the gold and silver could be hundreds of tons. In India, every native ruler has a secret hoard, constantly adding to it. Mowgli, however, didn't grasp the significance.

Two nights later, the White Cobra sat in the dark vault, feeling ashamed, robbed, and lonely.

Kotuko discovered the dogs fighting over a freshly caught seal, following the fish disturbed by the storm. This was the first of many seals landing on the island that day.
