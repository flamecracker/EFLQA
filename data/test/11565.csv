A week after Sir Henry's appeal, two hundred men gathered at Furness Hall. Their attire, unlike the professional soldiers of the Continent, varied.

Sir Henry, leading the group with his friends, all in similar attire, rode with two officers at the front of each troop. The men wore wide hats and scarfs symbolizing loyalty to the king.

The rest, however, seeing that a brave fight against odds was about to commence, declared their willingness to put themselves under Harry's orders.

On the 25th of September, nearly a week after the battle of Newbury, all the members of Parliament still remaining in London gathered in St. Margaret's Church to sign the Solemn League and Covenant. However, even in this moment of unity, the parties had conflicting expectations. The Scotch hoped for the introduction of Presbyterianism in England and the abolition of Episcopacy. The English members signed with the intention of preserving their own religion, a form of Episcopacy different from the Scotch system. Following a skirmish, Harry Furness was tasked with delivering messages to the Earl of Newcastle, accompanied by Lady Sidmouth and her daughter. Along the way, they encountered a clash between Cavaliers and Roundheads, prompting them to seek refuge in Hardley House, a fortified castle facing a siege by the Parliament forces.

The moderate party gave in to the demands of the Independents, leading to resignations and a shift in power. Fairfax and Cromwell united their forces and pursued the king, culminating in the Battle of Naseby. Rupert attacked Fairfax's left wing, while Cromwell engaged Langdale's squadrons.

The desperate plan of the Cavaliers failed as the army blocked their path to Whitehall. The Cavaliers, filled with grief and rage, rode into the country.

The winter passed quietly as the English troops struggled with the harsh climate. Cromwell fell ill and had to return to England, leaving Leslie's army fortified around Stirling. In June, Cromwell advanced against Perth, capturing it in July. Meanwhile, Charles marched toward England from Stirling as the road lay open. Argyll and his party were unpopular, and few joined Charles as he crossed the border. The Royalists were reluctant due to past betrayals and devastation. Charles reached Worcester, where Cromwell's forces closed in. Harry prepared for the worst, planning to escape to the coast with loyal companions. England sought peace after years of turmoil, and the king's safety was paramount. The hope was for a future return when England tired of the Roundhead rule.|"1.

After returning to Hamburg, Harry sought out the gypsy maid who had helped him. She was still singing at a local tavern. Harry arranged to meet her discreetly by the riverbank the next day with Lucy, who wanted to assist the girl. Zita, the maid, accepted Harry and Lucy's offer to go to England to escape her harsh life with the gypsies. She feared the gypsies would retaliate if they discovered her plans, so they devised a secret escape.
