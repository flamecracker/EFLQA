As the boys neared the station lights, they split up, with Will and George veering off while Sandy and Tommy continued ahead. Once they were a safe distance from the tracks, they walked about twenty rods apart, perpendicular to the right of way. Tommy and his friend's path to the mine led them across various tracks, passing by the weigh-house and eventually reaching the breaker. Approaching a line of empty cars on a spur, they heard a noise from one of the cars and crouched to listen.

Suddenly, a shadowy figure jumped out of the car, but Sandy, following instructions, tripped the figure to the ground. The fallen person complained of an attempted attack, warning about dangerous individuals nearby. Tommy realized they had let another person escape, causing potential trouble as their presence might be known to the mine workers.
