Our ship faced a dire situation. The Jesus, a Spanish vessel, launched a fierce attack, sinking one of our ships. Amidst the chaos, we fought back fiercely. The battle was intense, with Spanish forts bombarding us from the shore. Despite the odds, we held our ground. However, when the Jesus signaled distress, our captain made a bold move to rescue them. As the Jesus sank, we managed to save some of their crew. But the Spaniards, fearing our bravery, set fire to their own ships and sent them towards us.

Upon approaching the port of Nombre de Dios in the early morning, they encountered a small unprepared Spanish ship loaded with Canary wine. The English boarded the ship without resistance from the sleeping crew. Hearing oars in the distance, Captain Drake ordered a pursuit to prevent the town from being alerted. The English managed to catch the boat and towed the crew back to their ship. They rowed to the town's battery and climbed over the wall undetected. Captain Drake divided his men into three groups to make a grand entrance at the marketplace, where they faced initial resistance from the Spaniards. The English retaliated with arrows, taking control of the town and advancing towards the Treasury to seize the treasure.

The alarm spread through the town as the English attacked to plunder the public treasuries. The firing ceased, and the townsmen, realizing the threat to their city, held back. The English seized a group of Spaniards who led them to the governor's house full of riches. Amidst the silk hangings and gold and silver vessels, the English marveled at the wealth. A pile of silver bars amazed them, but Captain Drake urged them to the Treasury House, promising even more gold and precious stones. As the Spaniards regrouped to defend their city, Captain Francis, wounded and weak, fell, causing a momentary panic among the men. Ignoring the treasure, they carried their fallen captain to safety, leaving behind the vast riches. The crew regrouped on an island, relieved that Captain Drake's wound was not life-threatening, and they found solace in their survival, despite missing out on immense wealth.|"1.

Upon the second day after their arrival at the Isle of Victuals, they saw a boat rowing out from the direction of Nombre de Dios. As they knew that there was no fleet in that harbor which would venture to attack them, the English had no fear of the approaching boat; although, indeed, they wondered much what message could have been sent them. On board the boat was an hidalgo, or Spanish noble, who was rowed by four negroes. He said that he had come from the mainland to make inquiries as to the gallant men who had performed so great a feat, and that he cherished no malice, whatever, against them. He wished to know whether the Captain Drake who commanded them was the same who had been there before, and especially did he inquire whether the arrows used by the English were poisoned; for, he said, great fear and alarm reigned in the town, many believing that all who had been struck by the English shafts would certainly die. Then the hidalgo inquired why the English had so suddenly retreated from the town, when it was in their hands, and why they had abstained from carrying off the three hundred and sixty tons of silver which lay at the governor's house, and the still greater value of gold in the treasure house--the gold, indeed, being far more valuable than the silver, insomuch as it was more portable. The answers to all these questions were freely given, for in those days|"1. What was the purpose of the hidalgo's visit to the English on the Isle of Victuals?

The crew aboard the Swanne noticed the ship was sitting lower in the water than usual. Despite their initial disbelief, they discovered a severe leak. Efforts to pump out the water failed, and the ship was deemed unsalvageable. The crew and goods were transferred to another vessel before the Swanne sank. The loss was a blow to the crew, who had a deep attachment to their ship. The admiral's decision to keep the sinking a secret prevented a loss of morale among the crew. The crew then filled the Pacha with supplies and set out on pinnaces to capture another ship. The crew rested in the Gulf of Darien before resuming their pursuit of passing ships. A daring attack on a Spanish galleon ensued, showcasing the English buccaneers' fearless and fierce fighting spirit.|"1.

"The intense fighting spirit of the English was the key to their victory over the outnumbered Spaniards. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the English crew, led by Captain Drake, charged at the Spaniards with a ferocity that caused the larger force to retreat. The Spaniards, though initially brave, were overwhelmed by the relentless attack of the English, armed with heavy axes and driven by their fury. The Spanish officers' attempts to rally their men failed, and soon they were forced to flee or surrender.

After securing the ship, Captain Drake ordered the prisoners, including a young Spanish lady, to be disarmed and sent away in boats to prevent any looting. When the young lady fell overboard in panic, Ned, one of the crew members, bravely rescued her from the sea. Captain Drake ensured her safety and comfort, providing her with supplies for the journey back to land.

"After a brief discussion, the King of Ternate and his people decided to embrace Christianity. The process was simple; they only needed to declare themselves Christians, receive the sign of the cross, and be sprinkled with water by the priest. The ceremony took place the next day with great pomp outside the castle walls. The King and his subjects knelt, made the sign of the cross, and were sprinkled with holy water. They were warmly welcomed into the Church.
