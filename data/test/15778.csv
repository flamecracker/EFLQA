""Hush, my dear, that is sufficient. I always feared the effect of the low society of this place on you both, and in especial on you, Mabel. My fears have been justified by the results. As soon as Loftus's wedding is over we will return to our seclusion, my dears.""

""Oh, my dear!"" Mrs. Bell's full-moon face turned absolutely pale. ""Going away, my love!"" she said. She thought of her private hoard, not nearly large enough, and her voice became absolutely pathetic. ""Going away, Miss Hart? I'm truly grieved to hear it. And haven't I made you comfortable enough, my poor dear?""

""Oh, you misunderstand me, Mrs. Bell. I am going away, but only for a little--just for a day or two. I don't know exactly when I shall be back, but probably in a day or two. I am going by the early train, and I tapped at your door to say good-bye."""|"1. What did Mabel's mother criticize her for?
