Vincent and Captain Longmore shared a tent in General Stuart's staff. Late into the night, they were startled by musketry down at the river.

A few incidents made me doubt Pearson, Vincent. I found out he wasn't managing my accounts properly. Mr. Robertson, a tobacco speculator, mentioned that the tobacco prices were rising, and the Orangery tobacco fetched top prices. When I checked my accounts, I realized Pearson had only credited me with a third of what he received. I promptly let him go. Money was tight due to low produce prices, but I had savings from reduced expenses and investments. Despite contributing to war efforts, I aimed to cut costs and support the state. Pearson's behavior was suspicious, especially his connections with the Yankees. I suspect he may have been involved in Dinah's disappearance. Farrell, now in charge, might have information on Pearson's whereabouts. Vincent planned to speak with Farrell, who he believed was a fair supervisor, unlike Pearson.
