In ancient times, Egypt was a formidable naval power, with a history of naval battles and ships that patrolled the Mediterranean and the east coast of Africa.

The Egyptologist, in his arrogant manner, dismisses modern politics as fleeting, focusing solely on ancient relics. Yet, these relics are more than artifacts; they are the living school-books of a nation. The Egyptian government spends vast sums preserving these treasures, not for tourism or ethics, but as a guide to their past and future. The archæologist's work is crucial, but the true purpose is often lost in academic discussions. The public sees it as mental gymnastics, missing the essence of the research. The archæologist's life in a museum is surrounded by decaying objects, but his dreams are filled with the vibrant history these relics once held.

The archaeologist's work is often likened to the dust he sifts through, a paradoxical notion. Despite expectations of uncovering tales like old wine to excite the senses, archaeology is more about precise reconstructions of the past. The archaeologist delves into the state secrets of kings and the rich history of nations, hearing tales of ancient heroes and battles. While one might imagine a crowd of adventurous souls hanging on his every word, the reality is different. At a lecture in a small town, the audience is a motley crew - a melancholy lady, a club-footed man, and an elderly woman discussing the pelvis of a mastodon. The archaeologist's stories may not draw the glamorous and bold but rather a diverse group seeking knowledge and a connection to the past.|"1. What is the main idea of the text passage?

The most skilled workers were chosen to excavate a chamber, and the excavator, many years back, toiled under the weight of fame and an air of mystery etched on his sunburnt face. The memory vividly recalls the letter sent home that week, hinting at a significant discovery on the horizon. The image of the desert sand where the laborers sweated remains clear. Yet, hopes were dashed when no tomb entrance was found in that part of the site. The focus shifted to the north end, where men dug deeper until they hit rock, revealing a shaft leading into the earth. The royal tomb of Pharaoh Senusert III was finally uncovered. Excitement filled the days, but concerns arose about robbers trying to infiltrate the tomb. After a brief scuffle, the tomb was secured, and no robbers had entered. A long night watch followed, leading to the arrest of some culprits. The tomb extended deep into the cliff, culminating in the discovery of the empty royal sarcophagus. This marked the end of an intense season of work.|"1. What was the initial focus of the excavation at the archaeological site?

In the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings at Thebes, Mr. Theodore M. Davis conducted excavations in collaboration with the Egyptian Government's Department of Antiquities. As an official of the Department, I witnessed the remarkable discovery of the tomb of Yuaa and Tuau, parents of Queen Tiy. When the tomb entrance was cleared, a passage led to a chamber filled with treasures from over three thousand years ago. The room was like a time capsule, with preserved wooden chairs adorned with gold, alabaster vases, and even a liquid substance still unspoiled. The chamber also contained a chariot, beds with gold designs, and magical figures believed to aid Prince Yuaa in the afterlife.

Before we could proceed further, many flashlight photos had to be taken, and drawings of the doorway had to be made. A panel of the woodwork was removed with a fret-saw to avoid damaging the lock and seal. Finally, the way into the tomb-chamber was open. Stepping through the door frame, we found ourselves in a clear space with funeral furniture all around. On the left, the coffins of the noble and his wife loomed large. Everything looked new and undecayed, neatly arranged. The gravel on the floor was smooth, not a speck of dust in sight. Over the large coffin, a pall of fine linen was laid. Near it, a wooden pedestal with a copper dish containing ashes of incense. Tables held cakes of bread, onions, and fruit. Bronze vessels for drinks were scattered around. The chamber was filled with flowers, with a ceremonial wig and delicate vases in chests. The coffins were hidden, and nothing could be touched until records were made. Despite precautions, illegal excavation continues, with tragic consequences like a native family's demise in a tomb.|"1.

"The Egyptian peasants strongly believe in the power of spirit creatures. A native seeking hidden treasure in the desert sacrificed a lamb each night to appease the _djin_ believed to guard it.

"Queen Tiy had many children with the King, but it wasn't until they had ruled for over twenty years that a son and heir named Amenhotep, later changed to Akhnaton, was born. It is believed he was born in the grand royal palace in Thebes, near the desert and western hills. The palace was vast and beautifully decorated with paintings of animals. The King had even created a pleasure lake for the Queen, surrounded by Asian trees. Akhnaton was born into a lavish and luxurious environment, surrounded by music and golden wine cups. The ancient priesthood of Amon-Ra, however, viewed the birth of this new prince with skepticism, as he was destined to challenge their traditional beliefs. The priests were conservative and proud, resistant to changes in religious practices.

The theft of ancient artifacts discovered during approved excavations is a common type of robbery. It is challenging for the supervisor to monitor the workers closely enough to prevent them from taking small items they find. A young girl tending to her father's livestock near the site may be receiving these stolen objects. Digging for antiquities in authorized excavations is more profitable than operating the water-hoist, a typical peasant job. The routine of the water-hoist is dull, while searching for artifacts in the ground is always intriguing. The fear of losing discovered artifacts to foreign collectors drives some locals to keep what they find. The vandalism of historic monuments is condemned by many, including Egyptians who donated to protect tombs. Damage to public monuments is seen as unfair play and can stem from revenge or spite. Punishing offenders can lead to retaliation on the monuments themselves. Dealing in stolen antiquities is considered an honorable profession by some, making it difficult to combat this illicit trade.|"1. What is a common type of robbery mentioned in the text?

Recently, a young man accused his father of stealing a statuette. The son claimed his father took it, but the father denied it. When the son's brother was questioned, it seemed the father might be guilty. However, the brother explained that the son asked the father for money, but he refused. The son believed he was owed the money and took it from his father's house. The father found out and retrieved the money. In retaliation, the son falsely accused his father. Sometimes, appearances can be deceiving, like a lady who unknowingly bought a stolen scarab from a boy claiming honesty.

In certain archaeological sites, workers are rewarded for each ancient item they discover, preventing dealers from outbidding. This practice can be costly for archaeologists, who may pay £10 or £20 daily. However, some workers may bring artifacts from far and wide to sell. Despite its flaws, this system is deemed successful. In government excavations, overseers monitor minor finds, reserving rewards for significant discoveries. For instance, a worker was paid £14 for finding a gold hawk's head. He debated whether to buy a wife or a cow with the money. Advised to choose the cow, he later squandered his earnings. In another case, a man buried his £400 reward, which his sons later searched for in vain. Reporting finds to authorities can lead to rewards, promoting responsible excavation to preserve historical context.|"1.

The region of Lower Nubia is situated between the First and Second Cataracts of the Nile. Aswan, a town known for its historical significance and now a popular winter destination for Europeans and Americans, is located a few miles below the First Cataract. Two hundred miles further south, at the base of the Second Cataract, lies Wady Halfa. The small town of Derr, nestled among palm trees halfway between Aswan and Wady Halfa, houses the province's sole police station. The land is mostly barren, with only a narrow strip of cultivation along the river, bordered by desert. The scenery is rugged and impressive, with rocky hills towering above the riverbanks. The local population, mainly women, engage in agricultural work and village activities.

When discussing important matters, it is crucial to approach them with a clear mind and balanced thinking. Just as excessive drinking can cloud judgment, so can extreme opinions and criticisms. Observing the scene on a Saturday night in the Old Kent Road, where many seem intoxicated, prompts us to consider the intoxication of the mind caused by immoderate thoughts. It is vital to maintain sobriety in our opinions, akin to critical teetotalism, to ensure our views are rational and not distorted. Take, for instance, the case of Philae and the Lower Nubian temples affected by the construction of a dam. While some argue the flooding benefits the island temple, others call for extreme measures against the engineers. Both views are immoderate. Engineers carefully selected the dam site to minimize damage to modern interests, including few cultivated fields and a small population. They concluded that the temples would not be significantly harmed by the flooding, as they would only be submerged for five months each year. The temples would remain intact for the rest of the year.

It is vital to maintain sobriety in our opinions, akin to critical teetotalism, to ensure our views are rational and not distorted. Take, for instance, the case of Philae and the Lower Nubian temples affected by the construction of a dam. While some argue the flooding benefits the island temple, others call for extreme measures against the engineers. Both views are immoderate. Engineers carefully selected the dam site to minimize damage to modern interests, including few cultivated fields and a small population. They concluded that the temples would not be significantly harmed by the flooding, as they would only be submerged for five months each year. The temples would remain intact for the rest of the year. When considering the administrative and financial aspects, it was a reasonable decision to proceed with the dam construction. Experts assure that any minor damages can be repaired during the dry months. The impact of water on the temple's reliefs and inscriptions is minimal, as evidenced by similar stone structures along the Nile that have maintained their sharp hieroglyphs despite being submerged for centuries. Thus, the temples at Philae are expected to withstand the flooding without significant|"3. How does the author compare excessive drinking to immoderate thoughts?

"The remains of color on some reliefs at Philae will soon vanish, with little archaeological impact. However, the loss of color on the column capitals in the Hall of Isis would be a significant artistic loss. Suggestions include replacing the capitals with dummies or making careful facsimile copies. While the flooding of Philae is regrettable artistically and sentimentally, practical considerations are crucial. Visitors can see the ruins in autumn. Water in temples is not novel, and trees once surrounded Philae. The objections to the flooding are minimal. Despite some sorrow, there is no real cause for distress. The objections are overshadowed by the necessity of the dam. The closure of Philae for part of the year is a regrettable but necessary measure. The ""death"" of Philae is not accurate; the temples will endure. Past and present coexist, requiring compromise.

A lot has been discussed about the ancient carvings on the granite rocks near the First Cataract, many of which hold significant historical value. While quarrying for the dam, concerns were raised that these inscriptions might be destroyed. However, apart from one damaged inscription during preliminary stone testing, all hieroglyphs have been safeguarded. The Department of Antiquities, with help from the dam-building department, ensured the protection of these relics. Several ruins, like the Philae temples, will be partially submerged. Yet, efforts to preserve sites like the temple of Kalabsheh have been successful. The temple of Dendur will face partial flooding, but repairs have been made. The fortress of Koshtamneh will suffer damage, but detailed records have been kept. The temple of Maharraka, once in ruins, has been rebuilt to withstand water pressure. Archaeological efforts along the riverbanks continue to uncover and preserve valuable relics.|"1.

To complete the works in Lower Nubia, a museum in Aswan is proposed to display the discovered antiquities. The museum would showcase objects representing the arts, crafts, and industries of Lower Nubia throughout its history. Funding for this project is uncertain, but establishing such a museum would be highly beneficial. In 1907, the monuments in Lower Nubia were in poor condition, with temples falling apart and cemeteries being looted. However, significant improvements have been made since then. The attention brought by the flooding of the area led to the restoration and protection of these ancient sites. The English and Egyptian officials allocated substantial funds for monument preservation, demonstrating a commitment to safeguarding historical relics. The role of archaeologists in the field versus those in museums is discussed, highlighting the importance of on-site research and the changing perceptions of archaeologists over time.|"1.

Egyptologists have three main reasons to visit Egypt often. Firstly, studying archaeology in the open air is healthy and inspiring. Working in the Egyptian desert or swimming in the cool Nile boosts physical health and invigorates the mind more than studying in a museum. Living in the open toughens the body and prepares it for work, unlike the comfort of city life. Some archaeologists live a rougher life to avoid becoming too comfortable. Roughing it means living without certain luxuries, like camping outdoors and skipping some comforts of civilization. This kind of lifestyle benefits health and ensures that work is done by healthy individuals. It's important for scholars to pay attention to their physical health, especially since indoor work can weaken the body. By embracing a more active lifestyle, archaeologists can dispel the misconception that they are weak or eccentric individuals.|"1. Why do Egyptologists visit Egypt often?

A museum serves three main purposes. Firstly, it acts as a safe haven for stray objects that may otherwise be lost or destroyed. Curators should only acquire items that are at risk of disappearing. Secondly, a museum is a repository for historical documents like papyri and ostraca, functioning as a public library for educational expansion. Lastly, museums are permanent exhibitions for public enlightenment and student learning. Instead of solely focusing on obtaining original antiquities, museums should also include replicas, models, and facsimiles for educational purposes. Curators should prioritize preserving antiquities in their original locations whenever possible. The primary goal is not to amass a large collection of valuable artifacts but to ensure the preservation and accessibility of historical objects for study and public benefit.|"1.

The actions of Western museums in acquiring artifacts from Egypt have led to the destruction and loss of valuable historical pieces. Robbers have exploited this demand, causing irreparable damage to ancient tombs and monuments. The relics, like the relief of Queen Tiy, have been looted, defaced, and sold to museums worldwide. The practice of purchasing stolen artifacts perpetuates this cycle of theft and destruction. Although curators argue that acquiring these pieces prevents them from falling into the wrong hands, it ultimately incentivizes further plundering. The only sustainable solution lies in promoting ethical practices by encouraging scholars and enthusiasts to study and appreciate Egyptian history firsthand in its natural setting. This approach fosters a deeper respect for the country's heritage and discourages the illicit trade of antiquities.|"1. What is the main consequence of Western museums acquiring artifacts from Egypt?
