Smuggling occurs in this region, particularly in Hobart. If one observes certain individuals entering through the back door of a restaurant at night, they might identify the smugglers. The townspeople here don't see the point in paying duty on goods from neighboring Canada. As night fell, the boys cooked a stew using canned beef, potatoes, and carrots. Making a meat stew in the woods is simple: cut the meat and vegetables into small pieces, simmer in water over coals, and ensure it doesn't dry out. While Dick cooked the stew, Phil and Garry gathered wood. Dick used a sapling as a rolling pin to make biscuits. For a dozen biscuits, mix flour, baking powder, salt, shortening, and water, then bake over hot coals.|"1. What might help identify smugglers in Hobart?
