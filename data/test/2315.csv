"Dear Mother, I have arrived safely. My attire wasn't much wrinkled, and Aunt Jane helped me smooth it out. I find Mr. Cobb quite likable. He chews tobacco but delivers newspapers accurately to house doors. I rode outside with him briefly, then moved inside before reaching Aunt Miranda's house. Even though I didn't want to, I thought you would prefer it. ""Miranda"" is a long word, so I plan to refer to Aunt Miranda and Aunt Jane as Aunt M. and Aunt J. in my Sunday letters. Aunt J. gave me a dictionary to look up challenging words. It's time-consuming, and I'm grateful people can talk without needing to spell. Speaking is easier than writing and more enjoyable. The brick house looks just as you described it. The parlor is magnificent and gives you shivers when you peek through the door. The furniture is elegant, but there aren't many comfortable spots to sit except in the kitchen. The same cat is here, but they don't keep the kittens, and the cat is too old to play with. Hannah once mentioned that you ran away to marry father, and I can imagine it must have been lovely. If Aunt M. were to run away, I think I'd prefer living with Aunt J. She doesn't dislike me as much as Aunt M. does. Please tell Mark he can have my paint box, but I'd like him to keep the red cake in case I return home. I"|"1.

"Dear Mother,

I am feeling very unhappy this morning. I read about Cora, The Doctor's Wife, in a book. Cora's husband's mother was like Aunt M. to me, cross and unfeeling. I wish Hannah had come instead of me, as Aunt M. wanted her. Hannah is better than I am and doesn't talk back quickly. Are there any pieces of my buff calico? Aunt J. wants some to make a new waist, button behind, so I won't look outlandish. The styles in Riverboro are pretty, and the ones at Meeting are elegant, more than in Temperance.

School is good. The Teacher can answer more questions than the Temperance one, but not as many as I can ask. I am smarter than all the girls but one, not as smart as two boys. Emma Jane can add and subtract in her head quickly and knows the spelling book well but lacks thoughts. She is in the Third Reader but dislikes stories in books. I am in the Sixth Reader, but Miss Dearborn threatens to put me in the baby primer class with Elijah and Elisha Simpson, the little twins, because I can't say the seven multiplication Table.

I am trying for the spelling prize but fear I won't get it. I wouldn't care, but wrong spelling looks terrible in poetry. Last Sunday, when I found seraphim in the dictionary, I was ashamed I had spelled it as serrafim. But"|"1. What is the main reason for the speaker feeling unhappy in the morning?

"Dear John,

I am reminded of the time when we tied the new dog in the barn, and he bit the rope and howled. I feel just like him, except the brick house is now my barn. I can't bite Aunt M. because I must show gratitude. Education will shape me and help us pay off the mortgage when we're older.

She cherished her lunch and recited her next Friday afternoon piece with joy.

The little schoolhouse on a hill had a simple setup with wooden desks and benches. Rebecca's classroom had twenty students, and she aspired to sit in the back like the advanced students.
