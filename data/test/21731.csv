The men, who appeared to never think about anything, and who had only one duty, which was to follow orders, rushed onto the deck and climbed up the rigging swiftly; the sails of most of the main sails were tied up, and soon, the canvas was secured to the yards.

The ship initially leaned so much that the masts were nearly in the water, making it as impossible for anyone to walk on the deck as to walk along a wall. Simultaneously, the sea was whipped into white foam, and the blinding spray swept over us angrily. ""Reel in the topsails!"" shouted the captain. But his voice was drowned out by the howl of the storm. However, the men were spared the danger of going out on the yards because in a few more moments, all the sails, except the storm-try-sail, were torn and shredded. We attempted to turn the ship's bow into the wind and ""lie to,"" which means we tried to face the storm and stay in one place. But the gale was so strong that this was impossible. The last bit of sail was blown away, and then we had no choice but to present our stern to the storm"|"1. What was the main duty of the men on the ship during the storm?

As the boat closed in, the harpooner plunged the harpoon into the whale's side, and the crew found themselves perched on the whale's back momentarily before the creature bolted away. The captain, undeterred, delivered additional blows with his lance before the whale vanished into the depths.|"3.

"The command was given to ""hold on the line"" as our boat swiftly glided through the water. The line, passing around the sturdy ""logger-head,"" began to smoke, risking a fire until a crew member doused it with water. Handling the line was precarious, as any snag could drag the boat under. Tom managed the line expertly, easing the strain when needed. Soon, the fish tired, and Tom reeled in the slack. As the fish surfaced, we prepared to harpoon it, but it dove deep, freeing itself.

"The massive whale was a sight to behold, with a body measuring forty feet in length and twenty feet in girth at its thickest. Its head, resembling a large, blunt boat, spanned eight feet from tip to blow-holes situated on its back. The ears were tiny holes, barely noticeable, and its eyes were small in proportion to its size. The mouth was vast, lined with large, unattractive lips. Its tail, a deadly weapon, boasted flukes measuring thirteen feet across, capable of smashing a boat with a single strike. A harpooner once narrowly escaped as the whale's tail came crashing down, slicing a boat in two. The whale's unique feeding mechanism involved whalebone plates with bristle-like hairs that trapped its prey, small sea creatures known as ""medusae.""

"The sperm whale stands out for its blunt head, resembling a squared log, making up a third of its body. Unlike the right whale, it hunts with powerful teeth, favoring large cuttlefish. Some have been seen ejecting these prey items as long as a boat. They are fiercer than right whales, known to attack boats when provoked. These ""fighting-whales,"" usually old bulls, pose challenges for whalers, often escaping with multiple harpoons. The tale of the American ship _Essex_ in 1819 exemplifies the whale's might. A colossal whale collided with the ship, causing severe damage. After a brief respite, the whale returned, ramming the ship and causing its demise.

Three men chose to stay on a desolate sand-bank, hoping to be rescued by a passing ship rather than risk crossing the vast ocean in open boats. Their companions bid them a sad farewell and departed. Unfortunately, this island was far from the usual ship routes, and the fate of the three men was unknown. The rest of the crew, comprising twenty men, embarked on a two-thousand-mile journey towards Juan Fernandez Island. Tragically, only five men survived. The mate's boat was rescued by the _Indian_ of London, with three survivors, while the captain's boat was found by the _Dauphin_ of Nantucket, with two survivors who resorted to cannibalism to survive. The third boat was lost at sea. Whales, though powerful, are not naturally aggressive. The right whale is timid, and the sperm whale tends to flee when threatened. Their main adversaries are the swordfish, thrasher, and killer whale. The killer whale is the most dangerous, using its strength and speed to overwhelm large whales.|"1.

He shared this astounding fact with his fellow sailors, who were equally astonished. The young doctor had explained that the number was so vast that it would take forty thousand men a considerable amount of time to count them all. Despite the skepticism of some sailors, an old clergyman later confirmed that the doctor's calculation was accurate. The sailors were interrupted by the sudden appearance of an enormous whale, sparking excitement and a swift response to pursue it. The crew sprang into action, launching their boats and chasing after the massive creature with great determination.|"3. Who confirmed the accuracy of the doctor's calculation?

"""Hold on tight!"" shouted the captain, and we quickly rowed away with all our strength. Just in time, the whale swung its massive tail over our heads, nearly covering the boat. With a thunderous crash, the tail hit the water, showering us with spray. The ocean churned into foam as the wounded whale thrashed about. The water turned white like milk, tinged with red from the whale's blood. Suddenly, the whale dove deep, pulling our boat at a breakneck speed. Sparks flew from the rope as we raced over the waves, leaving a trail of foam behind us. Despite the danger, we managed to reel in the line, preparing for the next encounter. The captain readied his lance as we approached the whale again. This time, the captain's strike hit home, causing the whale to spout blood—a sign of a mortal wound. Yet, the battle was not over.

We all quickly agreed with the captain's plan, as his speech had a big impact on us. It wasn't just what he said, but how he said it. The captain was naturally bold and resolute, never shying away from danger or duty. When we heard him speak that way, we could hardly believe it.

Others thought he was being overly cautious, predicting bad luck for the ship. Eventually, we saw the benefits of the change in many ways, filling the ship with oil much sooner than expected. Shore people might not understand how simple things can bring joy to sailors on long voyages. One such joy is having a gam with another ship, a social gathering at sea where crews meet and mingle. During one gam with a Yankee ship, we eagerly soaked up news and camaraderie, feeling like brothers with these strangers on the vast ocean.|"1. What was the crew's reaction to the captain's plan?
