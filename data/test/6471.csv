Imagine if we both had guns, my shot could have roused another deer within range for you to shoot; or if a deer was farther off, the sound might have prompted it to move, allowing us to track it. Notice the antlers on this deer - it has nine, while a younger deer has fewer. Let's prepare the venison now,"" said Jacob.

After attending to the deer, Jacob suggested, ""We are about four or five miles from home. Could you find your way back? No worries, Smoker will guide you. I'll stay here; you can fetch White Billy to carry the venison. It's too much for us alone. Let's pack it up and head back."" Edward agreed, and they proceeded to transport the venison. On their return, Jacob shared insights on deer-stalking with Edward. They reached home, hung the venison, stabled the pony, and enjoyed a meal prepared by Alice and Humphrey. Jacob then planned to sell venison in Lymington and acquire supplies. He advised Edward against accompanying him due to recognition risks. Instead, he promised to buy Edward a gun for future deer-stalking lessons and tools for Humphrey's carpentry skills. Alice would receive sewing supplies to hone her craft."|"5.
