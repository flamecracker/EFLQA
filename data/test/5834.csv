She thought he had been drinking in some tavern; it had been often so with him of late. ""I have sold Hirschvogel!"" said Karl Strehla in the same husky, dogged voice.

Hanging above her was a chandelier—a circle of countless tiny flames and droplets resembling dew or diamonds. She imagined it to be the sun drawing near. As time passed, it grew scorching, its rays stinging her. Guests came and went, oblivious to her presence. They feasted, laughed, and flirted, then returned to dancing, the music echoing all night.

Servants extinguished the lights, letting in the icy dawn. The rose tree wilted, its beauty falling to the ground.
