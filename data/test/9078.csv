When I was only five years old, my mother passed away. Even though twenty years have gone by, her memory remains vivid in my mind. I recall her as a gentle figure with a pale complexion, a warm smile, and a soft, cheerful voice. She would praise me with kindness and correct me with gentle firmness when I misbehaved.

As you relax on the fragrant hay or clean straw, absorbed in books about nature, it's delightful to watch the swift swallows darting in and out under the roof. Their mud nests, though made from dirt, are surprisingly tidy, and you wouldn't guess their humble abode from their sleek feathers. These chimney swallows, nesting in the chimney behind us, remind us of their presence with their nightly rumblings like distant thunder. They construct their nests with sticks glued to the chimney walls using saliva they secrete. When the young are ready to fly, they climb to the top of the chimney with their sharp claws and tail-feathers. Despite the small numbers in a neighborhood, large flocks gather at the end of the season. Sometimes, nests fall into fireplaces, amusing children who eagerly hold the fledglings. Just like birds thriving in chimneys, many successful individuals are born in humble places and soar to great heights.|"1. What are the swift swallows doing under the roof?

"I took the second man's spot. Larkin removed his coat, and, as he pulled the bow, I waited for the signal stroke.

We synchronized our movements, matching each other's deep breaths. What an effort! We leaned forward until our faces almost touched our knees; then, putting all our strength into the backward motion, we pulled on the oar until every inch was covered. We rowed for fifteen minutes, but it felt like hours. Sweat dripped, enveloping me in steam. ""Are we close, Mr. Larkin?"" I panted. ""Almost, captain,"" he replied. ""Keep going for our little ones at home,"" he urged. The oars flashed in the moonlight as determined fathers rowed. Suddenly, Larkin stopped, causing a moment of panic. But he reassured me, ""Gently, captain, a few more strokes."" With that, he leaped onto the ice. We found two sleeping boys, saved just in time. Mr. Larkin warmed one child with his body, and I did the same with the other.

In the past, people had to barter goods due to scarce coins. For example, a man might trade a bear-skin for a coat or pine-boards for molasses. Even musket-bullets were used as currency. The Native Americans used clam-shell money called _wampum_, which English settlers accepted for debts. There was a lack of money for salaries, so ministers received fish, corn, or wood instead of silver or gold. To address the shortage, a law established a coinage by Captain John Hull, who kept one shilling out of every twenty for making them. The silver used included old items like tankards and new bullion from South America seized by English buccaneers. The resulting pine-tree shillings, dated 1652, made Captain Hull wealthy. He even refused a large sum to keep his share, ending up with overflowing pockets and a chair to rest in.|"1. What was used as currency in the past due to scarce coins?

The sky is usually blue, the grass lush, the fields green, the trees shady, and the clouds quiet and mysterious. These sights have been the same yesterday, today, and will be so tomorrow and in the coming weeks. However, our minds crave variety and a change of scenery. This winter offers a different palette - the cold blue sky, gray rocks, and warm browns and russets replace the vibrant colors. Embracing this change brings a new and enjoyable experience. The period from late November to early December is often the saddest time of the year, evoking a sense of desolation. As summer fades, a gentle melancholy sets in, signaling the approaching winter. The fading flowers bid farewell until the next summer. The arrival of late summer golden-rods and asters marks the end of the blooming season, hinting at the impending snow. Birds too prepare for the change, ceasing their songs and focusing on their journey southward. Their departure, like the arrival of northern waterfowl, signals the transition from summer to winter. Finally, as late November approaches, the frost intensifies, marking the end of the season.|"1. What colors are typically associated with the winter palette described in the text?

"Secretary: It is true, sir. A messenger arrived at the palace recently with the news. Columbus was forced to anchor in the Tagus due to bad weather. Portugal is filled with excitement, and soon Spain will be too. The reaction is immense!

Don G: Let's wait and see. I, a practical man, won't be fooled by such a ridiculous tale! This so-called discovery won't amount to anything.

Don G: All that is very unreliable! I take a sensible approach. I'm a practical man; mark my words, it's all a hoax! The crews might have been misled. Columbus might have gone south instead of west. Anything is more likely than the discovery of a western coast.

Don G: I still say it's a hoax! Discovering an unknown coast by sailing west? Impossible! The earth a sphere and people upside down in space? Nonsense! A sailor from Genoa being right and all our scholars wrong? Absurd! I'm a practical man. I believe in what I can see and understand.
