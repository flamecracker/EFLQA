The Californians in Spanish California lacked the drive to excel in various areas, including cattle and sheep farming. The livestock was of poor quality compared to that brought in by Americans, with no efforts made to improve breeds.

During the early days, Spain discouraged outsiders from settling in California. The goal was to maintain political control and provide a refuge for Spanish people. Despite this, the number of foreign residents grew after 1822. These newcomers were eager to settle permanently, marrying locals and becoming valued citizens. They brought energy and enterprise to the region, unlike the easy-going Californians. Americans of a different kind arrived between 1830 and 1840, including trappers and traders from the West. Initially met with contempt and distrust, they formed rough communities. Isaac Graham, an American trapper, established a distillery and gained control over a group of belligerent individuals. Governor Alvarado, feeling insecure in power, used rumors of an uprising to solidify his influence by arresting Graham and his companions. Despite being released later, Graham and his group were used by revolutionary parties upon their return to California.|"1.

In 1840, California saw a rise in its foreign population, reaching just over four hundred people. While most were not warmly welcomed, two distinct groups arrived in November 1841, marking the true beginning of immigration to California. One group traveled via the Salt Lake Trail, paving the way for future pioneers, while the other group came through Santa Fé with ease. These newcomers intended to settle in California, prompting the Mexican Government to address the situation. Despite laws requiring legal passports, General Vallejo granted temporary permits to those in his district. As more groups arrived, concerns grew, especially with reports of a large Mormon migration.

During the early days in California, the immigrants and natives coexisted peacefully without conflict. However, the Mexican Government persistently ordered the prevention of immigration, fearing the Texan experience of absorption. This put Californian authorities in a difficult position. They were pressured to keep immigrants out, but lacked the means to enforce it. The situation remained stable until the Mexican War approached. Commodore Jones mistakenly raised the American flag in Monterey, soon realizing his error and rectifying it. Thomas O. Larkin, a respected citizen, was appointed consul to influence Californians towards annexation to the United States. John C.

"During this time, the Spanish sub-prefect, Guerrero, informed Larkin that foreigners who had bought property in California were being told their transactions were invalid.

During the Bear Flag Revolution in 1846, Americans in Sonoma, led by William B. Ide, rebelled. They raised a flag made of uncertain cotton cloth and drew a bear with berry juice on it. This act, endorsed by Frémont, nullified Larkin's peaceful plans for California. Englishmen hoped for English intervention due to this. Vallejo's group favored the United States. The Californian authorities protested to Sloat and Lieutenant Montgomery. Frémont's risky move coincided with the outbreak of war with Mexico. The Americans captured Monterey, and Stockton took over from Sloat. Stockton invited Frémont to join him, and they easily subdued southern California. Kearny, coming from the East, faced challenges and arrived with a smaller force in California.

A group of Californians led by Andrés Pico had been observing the Americans from the hills. A decision was made to confront them. Captain Johnston led twenty men in an attack on the Californians' camp at dawn on December 6th. The Californians fled after firing a deadly volley that killed Johnston. The Americans pursued but were ambushed due to being poorly mounted and out of ammunition. The Californians, armed with lances, pistols, and riata, inflicted heavy casualties. This battle, known as San Pascual, was unique as the Californians gained the upper hand. Conflict arose between American leaders Stockton and Kearny over authority. Stockton's bombastic behavior clashed with Kearny's command, exacerbated by Frémont's ambitious aspirations. Frémont, a prominent figure at the time, had a blend of talent and vanity that blurred the line between genuine achievement and self-promotion.|"1.

The line of authority was settled after the battles at the San Gabriel River and on the Mesa in January 1847. In the first clash, the Californians were stationed across the river with around 500 men and artillery. The Americans, with a similar number of men but mostly on foot, crossed the river, positioned their guns, and bombarded the Californians until they retreated.

Frémont, known as the Pathfinder, was a charismatic figure, skilled in wilderness travel and a lover of adventure. Despite his likable personality, he was overly ambitious and self-promoting. His historical significance has been exaggerated, as he mainly followed paths already traveled by others. The military conquest of California was achieved, leading to the establishment of a military government. The military Governors, particularly Colonel Mason, handled delicate situations with tact and efficiency. The legal system in California was informal, with the alcaldes enforcing laws based on their sense of justice rather than formal statutes. This unique approach to law led to interesting legal anecdotes, with judges often displaying rough but disciplined behavior in court.|"1. What is Frémont known for?

In early California, a priest from Santa Clara was taken to court in San José for breaking a contract. He argued that as a clergyman, he wasn't subject to civil law. The judge ruled that when the priest left his religious duties to make a deal with a citizen, he had to follow through like anyone else. This common-sense decision later became law. The judge also showed no patience for minor issues, like when a Mexican was fined for stealing leggings and the accuser was fined for wasting the court's time. As California transitioned from military to civilian government after the war with Mexico, there was confusion over its status. The people felt they had the right to govern themselves until Congress acted. Eventually, a constitutional convention was held in 1849, with delegates from various backgrounds creating a solid framework for the new state.|"1.

The constitution of California was approved by the people on November 13, 1849. This marked the beginning of the state government, even though California was not officially part of the United States until September 9, 1850. While it is commonly believed that the discovery of gold shaped California's destiny, it merely introduced a new element into its history. Before the gold rush, a significant wave of American immigrants had already begun settling in the region. The discovery of gold disrupted the orderly progression of events, leading to a rapid influx of people seeking their fortunes. This sudden change brought about a period of lawlessness and individualism, overshadowing the initial efforts towards organized governance. The gold rush transformed California into a melting pot of diverse cultures and emphasized the eventual necessity of social responsibility.|"1.

"Brannan gathered the usual tithes from these men, supposedly to send them to the Church at Salt Lake. However, he consistently failed to do so.

Parley P. Pratt and Sidney Rigdon were influential figures in the Mormon movement. Pratt, described as narrow-minded and fanatical, played a significant role, while Rigdon brought a cool and constructive approach that shaped Mormon theology. Without leaders like them, the movement led by Joseph Smith may have faded away. Smith's authority was bolstered by claims of receiving divine revelations and translating golden plates with angelic assistance. The Book of Mormon and the Mormon Church itself hinged on these beliefs. The Mormon communities rapidly expanded, especially in England, where impoverished individuals found solace in the promises of a new Zion. Despite facing opposition and persecution, the Mormons persisted in their quest for a homeland, making ill-fated attempts in Ohio and Missouri before settling in Nauvoo, Illinois. As their power grew, they became self-sufficient and even attempted to establish a separate political entity.

In 1848, the weather was perfect for farming, but a scarcity of food put a large community at risk of starvation. People resorted to eating animal skins, raw hides, and roots. When the crops were ready, a swarm of crickets threatened to destroy them. Miraculously, white sea-gulls swooped in and saved the day by defeating the crickets. This event repeated itself over time. In August 1849, the gold rush began, sparked by samples of gold-dust from California. Brigham Young discouraged gold-mining among his people. However, immigrants were eager to reach the gold mines and traded generously with the Mormons, who profited greatly. The friendly relations between the Mormons and immigrants did not last due to opposing beliefs and property disputes. The Mormons' fields were often damaged by the immigrants' cattle, leading to disagreements and fines. This sometimes caused tensions and prejudice between the two groups.|"1.

The whole town would come alive during these events, with roaring flames, cheering crowds, and the clatter of the pumps.

The immediate cause of the events that unfolded was the criminal actions of an Englishman named James Stuart. Stuart, a notorious criminal, believed he could escape punishment for his misdeeds. However, his arrest sparked a movement. One hundred and eighty-four influential citizens formed a secret Committee of Vigilance to address the growing lawlessness. The community's busiest individuals were called upon to take action. Despite initial skepticism, the Committee's first trial resulted in a conviction. The people, though initially hesitant, eventually supported the Committee's efforts. This led to the formal organization of the Vigilance Committee, with Sam Brannan playing a significant role. The Committee swiftly dealt with a notorious criminal, John Jenkins, who had a history of offenses. Jenkins, arrogant and unrepentant, underestimated the Committee's resolve. The peaceful merchants on the Committee remained steadfast in the face of threats from the city's rough elements.

The city rapidly rose from nothing, constructed by a bustling and transient population. People willingly paid high taxes to avoid involvement in public matters.

This led to legal inefficiency, corruption, and favoritism, morphing into political corruption. Elections were a mockery, with bullies guarding polls to intimidate citizens. Votes were openly bought, and ballot boxes were manipulated to favor certain candidates. Whiskey-fueled brawls on election day kept decent citizens indoors. The public became apathetic, feeling powerless against the rampant corruption. Violence and scandalous behavior plagued the streets, with newspapers fueling personal conflicts that often turned physical.|"1.

The Vigilance Committee, a group in San Francisco, was seen as a threat by the Law and Order officials. They believed the Committee acted against the law and were rebels. To handle this, the officials planned to declare a state of insurrection, starting with the Governor's approval. Despite legal maneuvers, when a Deputy Sheriff tried to serve a writ of habeas corpus to the Committee, they welcomed him but prevented him from carrying out his duty. This move made the legal plan fail. Subsequently, the Governor issued a proclamation, and the Committee sought help from federal authorities for weapons. However, General Wool, in charge of military forces, refused to arm them without orders from Washington. The officials then threatened to report him for not upholding the law, but Wool stood firm in his decision.|"1.
