Yesterday, I tried to teach Lottie Wright addition. I asked, 'If you had three candies in one hand and two in the other, how many would you have altogether?' Lottie humorously replied, 'A mouthful.' In nature class, when I asked why toads shouldn't be killed, Benjie Sloane solemnly said, 'Because it would rain the next day.' It's challenging not to laugh, Stella. I have to hold back my amusement until I get home. Marilla finds it unsettling to hear laughter from the east gable without reason. Teaching is fascinating yet tough. The hardest part is getting kids to share their true thoughts. I once asked them their deepest desires. Some were typical like dolls and skates, while others were unique. Sally Bell wished for a 'honeymoon,' thinking it was a fancy bicycle. The kids' compositions are delightful. I'll share Ned Clay's unedited letter with you.|"1.

"Dear teacher,

I plan to write about birds. Birds are helpful animals. My cat, named William or Tom as pa calls him, catches birds. He is striped with one ear frozen from last winter. My uncle adopted a cat that refused to leave, forgetting more than many know. He cherishes it more than his children, which seems unfair. While we should be kind to cats, we must also prioritize our children. 

St. Clair Donnell is concise and direct, lacking tact or imagination. Annetta Bell, usually brief, described Avonlea Hall with two doors, six windows, a chimney, painted blue. It's the third most important building in Avonlea after the church and blacksmith shop, hosting clubs, lectures, and concerts.

The mail arrived late with distressing news from all across the province. Homes were hit, lives were lost, and many were injured. The storm had disrupted the telephone and telegraph systems, and young livestock in the fields had sadly perished. Uncle Abe spent the entire day at the blacksmith’s forge, relishing his accurate prediction of the storm.
