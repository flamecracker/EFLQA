What an abrupt transformation! It has been less than an hour since I left the flat lands below, and yet the view around me resembles another world. I pause in a rugged area, examining it with curious eyes. The leaves are narrower, the foliage sparser, the jungle more open. There are ridges with sides nearly bare of trees. The palm trees are gone, replaced by similar forms that bear a resemblance to them. These are the mountain palms. I see the grand palmetto (Chamcerops) with its fan-like fronds extending from tall stems; the yuccas with their blade-like leaves and heavy clusters of green capsules. I also spot the pita aloe, tall and thorny, and various cacti with magnificent wax-like blooms.

The plain in front of me is flat, almost like it's made of liquid. I can see mountains surrounding it from all directions, but there are paths through them leading to other plains. These mountains rise directly from the plain itself, with steep cliffs or sloping sides. As I enter the plain, it looks different from the hot lands I came from. I am now in a cooler area known as the _tierra templada_. The air feels chilly compared to the hot lands below, more like spring. The view is open and almost treeless. This area is cultivated and shows signs of civilization, with towns, cities, cathedrals, and mud cabins made of unburnt bricks. The fields are fertile, filled with crops like maize, wheat, beans, and agave. There are orchards with pears, apples, and pomegranates, alongside cereals and tropical plants. As I cross into different valleys, the landscapes change from green pastures to sandy deserts and shimmering lakes surrounded by greenery. At a high elevation, I find myself in a forest with northern trees like oaks, mountain-ash, and pines, despite being in the torrid zone.|"1. What is the name of the cooler area the speaker enters?

In the morning, we were brought before the recorder, but with the help of my friends, we explained our side. The case was dismissed as self-defense, and we were free to go.

Raoul guided Hercules straight towards a clump of timber, aiming for safety beyond where he could find cover from his pursuers. We anxiously watched, knowing our fate hung on his escape. Despite the guerilleros blocking his path, we saw Raoul and Hercules nearing the edge of the woods. Lassos were thrown, shots fired, and for a moment, we feared Raoul was hit. But he reappeared, safely passing the timber islet and disappearing from sight. The enemy, stirred by the escape, frantically scoured the plain, their plans disrupted. As Clayley and I observed from the rancho roof, we noticed troops approaching, causing a commotion among the guerilleros. A dust cloud revealed troops with artillery, signaling a challenging situation for us. We prepared to defend ourselves, ready to fight or seek refuge in the timber if needed.|"1.

"""Can we do it?"" I exclaimed, suddenly remembering the peculiar piece I had freed from Hercules' saddle. ""Why didn't you say so earlier? Where's Major Blossom's rifle?"" I yelled, scanning the area. Lincoln stood steady, aligning his aim with the stockade. After wiping the sights clean, he positioned the rifle and took aim methodically. Nearby, a soldier readied a spherical case-shot at the six-pounder cannon. With a swift pull of the trigger, the cannon fired, and the soldier fell without a sound. As the rifle was reloaded, the Mexican soldiers by the cannon prepared to fire. A tall soldier stood by with a linstock and fuse, waiting for the command.

As the group hurried across the open plain, a sudden cry from the enemy signaled their discovery of the clever trick. The guerilleros mounted their horses with loud shouts and gave chase. The cannon positioned at the corral was swiftly turned around and fired, but the shot missed its mark, sailing harmlessly above. A small group of us hung back, ready to fire upon the closest pursuers or assist any soldiers who fell. One of the riders was thrown off his mule, and we quickly stopped to help. With the enemy closing in, shots were exchanged, and a tense standoff ensued. The sound of lassos whistling through the air filled the scene. Suddenly, I felt a noose tighten around my neck, and before I knew it, I was thrown to the ground with a violent force. Amid the chaos, gunfire erupted, and branches cracked as bullets flew past. Thankfully, we managed to find cover behind trees, escaping the worst of the attack.|"1. What signaled the enemy's discovery of the group's trick on the open plain?

It feels like an invisible bond holds our eyes and our souls communicate through mysterious ways, not just words. We talk about random things, yet they are not random. Narcisso, a brotherly theme, casts a shadow over our happiness. As I entered my chamber, I found a luxurious bed fit for rest, with canopies and curtains made from Damascus cloth.

Amidst the chaos, a deafening crash shook the earth, dust and debris filled the air. Gasping for air, I managed to whisper: ""We need to escape.""

We crept cautiously from rooftop to rooftop, seeking a safe spot to descend to the street below. The houses nearby were all single-story, and after passing a few, we lowered ourselves into a narrow alley. Despite the early hour, chaos reigned in the streets due to the ongoing bombardment. The air was filled with the screams of women, the shouts of men, and the cries of the wounded. Bombs whizzed overhead, and buildings crumbled around us. As we navigated the debris, a round-shot struck a nearby church, sending ancient ornaments crashing down. Unnoticed in the chaos, we moved on towards La Magdalena. As we reached the church, my companion descended to meet a boy who recognized me from our previous encounter. We swiftly entered a hidden passage, waiting for the tide to ebb before wading through the surf. After a challenging journey, we finally made it to Punta Hornos, where we were able to signal our comrades and safely pass through the lines. Subsequent nights were fraught with danger as guerillas lurked nearby, forcing us to wait for the fall of Vera Cruz. When the city finally fell on March 29, 1847, we saw the American flag flying over the castle of San Juan de Ulloa. The Mexican forces, led by Santa Anna, were rumored to be regrouping at Puente Nacional, but news soon arrived that they would make a stand at Cerro Gordo. Despite reports|"1.

After nightfall, we embarked on our journey with three skilled men - Lincoln, Chane, and Raoul, along with the young Jack. Mounted on the best horses available, I rode the magnificent black Arabian horse provided by the major. The ravages of war were evident in the desolate surroundings.

We moved cautiously, wary of any sound that might give away our position to the pursuers lurking nearby. Avoiding the clear path along the creek as suggested by Lincoln, we followed the stream in the shadows. There were whispers among the pursuers speculating on our whereabouts, suspecting a giant figure to be tailing them. Exhausted, we found shelter in a thicket, settling on a bed of dry grass for a much-needed rest. Upon waking to daylight, preparations for breakfast were underway, with an iguana being readied for cooking. As the Irishman roasted bananas over the fire, Chane humorously remarked on the unexpected turn of events, reflecting on the unusual circumstances we found ourselves in. The hunter's keen senses alerted us to potential danger, urging us to remain silent and attentive as he reacted swiftly to a new threat.|"1. What were the group cautious of while moving?

He looked despondent, a stark contrast to his usual bold demeanor. The shocking revelation spurred us into immediate action. We sprang from the fire and threw ourselves onto the grass. A low moaning sound, akin to a wild bee's hum, emanated from the earth, growing louder and sharper until it transformed into a vengeful yelp‚Äîthe distinctive bark of a Spanish bloodhound. We hastily plunged into a mountain torrent, navigating through still pools and cascades of basalt rocks. As we waded waist-deep in crystal-clear water, we heard the bloodhounds' chorus echoing down the glen. We trekked alongside the stream, ensuring we remained close to the water to outsmart the pursuing dogs. Despite intermittent barking, the bloodhounds failed to close in until we covered a considerable distance downstream. A companion's sudden action alerted us to imminent danger, propelling us towards a frowning precipice where the stream rushed through a narrow channel. We ascended a gorge leading to the cliff's edge, standing on a grassy platform, preparing for a perilous leap. The sight below, with the foaming torrent and jagged rocks, instilled fear as we braced ourselves for the daunting descent.|"1. What was the initial reaction of the group to the shocking revelation?

As we struggled down the slope, uneasy looks were cast over our shoulders. Weak from our encounter with sleuth-hounds, the tropical storm added to our challenges. Rain pelted our faces, making the ground slippery. Lightning and sulfur-filled air made breathing difficult. Despite our fatigue, we pressed on, driven by the fear of what was behind us. The race felt endless, like a nightmare where escape is elusive. Approaching the woods, exhaustion weighed us down. A hundred horsemen closed in on us, their vengeful cries piercing the air. Raoul reached the timber but turned back to stand with us. Gunfire and thunder filled the air, then darkness enveloped me as I collapsed. Frenchman tended to the fallen, their faces drained of color. Amid the chaos, a sense of determination emerged as we prepared to face our fate.|"4. What enveloped the speaker as they collapsed?

While Raoul was occupied with Clayley and the Irishman, I stood up and gazed back at the prairie. Rain poured down heavily, and lightning continued to flash intermittently. At a distance of fifty paces, a motionless black mass of men and horses lay on the ground where they had fallen. Some horsemen and their steeds were scattered around, while others attempted to corral their frightened horses towards us. Raoul believed that superstition might deter the pursuers due to the lightning being seen as a divine intervention. Despite our exhaustion, we pushed through the chaparral. After a few miles, we encountered a swollen stream due to the storm, preventing us from crossing. Feeling safe from our pursuers, we decided to camp by the stream. Raoul, full of energy, started a fire and gathered food while Lincoln tended to our wounds. As we rested and slept, we were startled by the approach of a troop of red monkeys led by an old chieftain, resembling a regiment of soldiers. Their unique tails and maternal care for their young fascinated us. The troop's strategic maneuvers to cross the stream showcased their intelligence and adaptability.|"1.

The chain of monkeys began to swing back and forth like a clock's pendulum. Starting slowly, the motion gained speed, with the lowest monkey banging its hands on the ground as it swung. Other monkeys on the higher branches helped with the swinging. The lack of branches on the lower part of the cotton-wood tree allowed them to swing freely. The swinging increased until the last monkey was flung to a tree on the opposite bank, where it held on after a few swings. Mothers with their babies clinging to their backs also made the crossing, creating a comical and curious sight. To get the monkeys forming the bridge over, they cleverly attached their tails to each other, forming a horizontal bridge. The scene was accompanied by the return of birds, singing in the now peaceful surroundings as the group headed towards the National Bridge.|"1.

"Raoul appeared uneasy despite everything happening around him. In the corner, a small priest in a shovel hat and black cloak caught his attention.

They were armed Mexicans escaping from battle, while their comrades waited in a hidden wood on the cliff, ready to descend. Observing from a distance, the American troops debated whether to pursue.

"I was surprised from a very gloomy daydream by a gunshot, the whistle of a rifle bullet, and the loud ""Stop"" of the major ahead. Quickly getting up, I saw a greenish object vanishing over the ridge. It was a lookout, who had shot and fled. I rode to the front where Twing was sending a small group to scout. I joined them, and after a short ride, we peered over the ridge and spotted a large howitzer not far away. Despite being outnumbered, we boldly saluted the flag flying over the gun, which confused the soldiers by the battery. A mounted rifleman later arrived with his regiment's flag. It was heartwarming to reunite with my comrades who thought they had lost us. I now led my own force and felt the urge to rectify my past mistakes. Clayley assured me we could handle the situation. As we observed the fleeing enemy below, I noticed a mule guarded by well-dressed soldiers, likely waiting for a high-ranking officer. My heart raced as I spotted a man being carried by one of them, possibly the Mexican dictator."|"1. What surprised the speaker from a gloomy daydream?

"I admit feeling strange emotions at that moment, one of the most anxious in my life.
