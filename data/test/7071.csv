Two days later, the rebellious Nineteenth regiment was disbanded at Barrackpore. On April 3rd, Mangul Pandy, who only injured himself, was hanged. A native officer of his unit faced the same fate for refusing to command his men to help an officer attacked by Pandy and for inciting mutiny against the government. This harsh lesson did not deter further unrest. Reports of discontent spread throughout Bengal and the northwest provinces. Fires broke out in Agra and Umballah, and letters instigating revolt were intercepted. Disturbances in Lucknow led to the disarming of the Seventh Regiment by Sir Henry Lawrence. As April passed, a sense of unease and peril intensified. The looming threat felt like the calm before a storm, with uncertainty about when or how it would strike. Despite some believing the danger would pass, those with families felt deep anxiety. The British were vastly outnumbered by natives in India, leaving many feeling helpless in the face of potential upheaval. The situation seemed unsettled, yet life in Sandynugghur carried on normally. However, a sudden turn of events occurred during a pleasant evening gathering at Major Warrener's residence when a Sepoy approached, delivering dreadful news that left everyone stunned. The unfolding crisis raised questions about the lack of European troops at Delhi and the potential spread of mutiny across India.

Let's plan the mission carefully. There used to be a clear lane near the corner before the houses were destroyed. We'll head there as it's less cluttered and we can avoid making noise by knocking over stones. We'll wait for a time when there's noise elsewhere to cover any sounds we make.

The British forces, stationed strategically to control the city and the vital river access, faced a mutinous Gwalior contingent approaching from the opposite side. The British general decided to split his forces, leaving some to guard the intrenchments while engaging the rebels in battle. Unfortunately, the British troops were forced to retreat after advancing too far from the city, resulting in a chaotic withdrawal where valuable supplies fell into enemy hands. Despite a brave defense, the British forces were outmaneuvered, and the city of Cawnpore suffered significant losses.
