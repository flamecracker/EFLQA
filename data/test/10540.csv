Nancy and her mother found solace in a passage from the Bible that Nancy read aloud, bringing comfort to their hearts. The words spoke of hope and a place called Beulah where the Lord delights. Nancy imagined her late father finding peace seeing them in the Yellow House at Beulah. Despite their loss, they felt neither forsaken nor desolate, but rather grateful for the love they shared. Julia, Nancy's young sister, was always the epitome of perfection, much to the annoyance of those around her. She was steady and conventional, unlike her flighty mother. Julia's upbringing had been strict, shaping her into a serious and disciplined young girl. Her siblings, who had learned to share and adapt, found her rigid nature somewhat stifling. Julia's perfection seemed to lack the spark of life, making her appear more like a character from a Sunday sermon than a lively child.|"1.
