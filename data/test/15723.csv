The boys were thrilled as they navigated the rowboat through the reef passage. Despite initial fears of taking on water, the skilled rowers safely guided them into the horseshoe harbor. Once ashore on a sandy strip near palm trees, the boys marveled at the beauty around them - towering palms, lush vines, and vibrant flowers filled the air with a sweet fragrance.

The group's spirits were lifted upon hearing that the treasure cave was nearby, despite the heavy rain. They followed Bahama Bill eagerly, but their excitement turned to disappointment upon seeing a pile of rocks blocking the entrance. Anderson Rover and his sons realized that reaching the treasure would be a monumental task due to the massive rocks and the possibility that the treasure might have fallen through the cave floor during the earthquake. Determined, Anderson Rover suggested using dynamite to clear the rocks, aware that it could take weeks or even months. After seeking shelter from the rain, they explored the area and planned how to access the treasure buried beneath. Bahama Bill hoped they wouldn't have to move too many rocks to reach the treasure. The group then focused on finding a path to the bay to ease their access to and from the yacht. Despite the challenges, they remained hopeful and determined in their quest for the treasure.|"1.
