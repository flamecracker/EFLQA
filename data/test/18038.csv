Spring brought brief sunshine, and new colonists began building houses. Thorolf was summoned to Knutson's headquarters, where they discussed the challenges of reaching Vinland. Despite the dangers, an expedition was planned. The crew set sail on the _Rotge_, led by Knutson, to explore the mysteries of Vinland.|"1.

"Thorolf extended his hand, and the Skroelings' leader cautiously accepted it. Walking in a line with toes straight ahead, the natives disappeared into the forest like frost in the sun. ""He asked why we're here,"" Thorolf explained. ""I told him we seek to explore and trade."" The leader mentioned that white men had visited long ago, hinting at a grim fate. He spoke of the Sagem, their chief, residing in a nearby castle. Thorolf relayed a message of peace and invitation from their commander. The next day, boats approached with the Sagem aboard.

The cold winter surprised the explorers in the southern land. Unlike Norway, the frost here was harsh. Coldness can bring out the worst in people, especially when they are isolated. Fortunately, the Skroelings, their friendly acquaintances, helped them. Munumqueh's remedy cured scurvy, and he taught them survival skills like making pemmican and birch canoes. When the ships didn't return, Nils proposed exploring the area. They learned of a river leading to five connected lakes inhabited by tribes. Despite the unknown dangers, they decided to venture forth in the Rotge, a sturdy boat. Escorted by small canoes, they journeyed through a bountiful land, encountering cliffs, rapids, and misty valleys. Upon reaching the plains beyond the Big Woods, they discovered a fierce warrior tribe hunting large animals. Despite the warnings, they pressed on, eager to explore further.|"1.

"Historians suggest that the region near the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes was once home to tribes of the Ojibway nation, with their territory stretching westward to what is now Minnesota. South of them were the tribes later known as the Iroquois. Accounts of the Northmen's open galleys describe them as small and light compared to later decked ships. The open ""sea-serpent,"" at forty-two feet, was heavier but not much larger than the largest Indian carrying-canoes used in the fur-trade, taken from the St. Lawrence through the Great Lakes.

The ship's leader was Gonsales Zarco, a nobleman under Dom Henriques. Once, he was swept north to an island during a storm, naming it Puerto Santo (Holy Haven). Returning, he found the islanders fearing a dark cloud to the northwest, believed to hide the abyss or Cipango. Gonsales decided to investigate, despite objections.

Landing in a sea-wolf cave, they named the island Madeira. Despite challenges, a colony was established. The island's first children were named Adam and Eva.

In the following year after John Cabot's passing, his son Sebastian embarked on a new journey. Leading a small fleet from Bristol with around 300 men, Sebastian navigated north but was halted by icy seas. Turning south, he discovered Newfoundland and ventured further to the mainland, reaching as far as the Chesapeake Bay. Meanwhile, fishing boats from various regions gathered off the Grand Banks, catching cod abundantly. Sebastian's tales of the plentiful fish were initially met with skepticism in Bristol until proof arrived in the form of large cod and caplin fish.

Norman and Breton fishermen annually sailed across the North Atlantic, resembling petrels. Towns like Honfleur, Saint Malo, La Rochelle, and Dieppe thrived due to cod fishing. The fish, known as baccalao or codfish, was beaten with a stick while drying to tenderize it. It was a popular and affordable choice for Lenten and fast-day meals in Europe. Despite the challenges, French captains found the fishing trade rewarding. Aubert and Verrazzano, learning from fishermen, discovered the region's wildlife and encountered unfriendly natives. Aubert navigated uncertain waters, encountering hostile warriors in canoes. Concerned about potential dangers, he turned back, avoiding a risky confrontation. The land to the west lacked the riches of Spanish territories, offering little wealth beyond the cod season. King Francis of Angoulême, focused on his court's finances, showed little interest in risky expeditions. In 1522, he met with the famed Verrazzano to discuss a new venture.|"1.

During the past several years, Verrazzano, like many other ship captains, had been involved in a specific type of mission known as piracy or privateering, depending on the perspective. France and Spain were not in a state of open war but were not exactly at peace either. Verrazzano had sailed the high seas commanding a ship armed and outfitted at his own risk, engaging Spanish galleons in combat wherever he encountered them. This tactic helped disrupt the King of Spain's overseas conflicts. The galleons heading eastward were often laden with treasures. The colonial leaders, settlers, sailors, and soldiers would claim the gold for themselves, making the riches from the Indies a tempting target for pirates. Verrazzano's skills and discretion caught the attention of Francis, who appreciated individuals capable of both self-reliance and discretion. The opulence and grandeur of Charles de Bourbon's palace at Moulins, with its Italian-style gardens and lavish furnishings, provided a backdrop for luxurious feasts fit for royalty. The exquisite meals featured a variety of delicacies, including rare fruits, game meats, and imported specialties, all served with fine wines and desserts. Verrazzano's bold stance on the moral implications of Spain's wealth acquisition resonated with King Francis I, who valued such perspectives.|"1.

Drake and his crew ventured into dangerous waters, risking imprisonment and torture to challenge the Spanish monopoly. Drake's crew fought fiercely but refused to harm unarmed individuals, women, or children. Their code of conduct set them apart from the Spanish|"1. What surprised Saavedra about the young leader?

Lescarbot departed, and by October, all colonists returned to France. Despite this, the experience was valuable.
