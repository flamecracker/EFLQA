Imagine this: I, with my strict beliefs and love for order, watching as my roommate casually embroiders on this peaceful Sunday afternoon. Her room is a mess - her bed, chairs, and dressing table look like chaos. Seeing her slippers in the middle of the floor at this hour frustrates me. Living with someone who mixes their belongings with yours can be a challenge. The disorder sometimes drives me to the edge. But I've learned to compromise. Margaret, a fellow student, taught me this. She once dealt with a roommate who liked cheap perfumes, which she despised. Margaret cleverly used mothballs to make a compromise. I tried a similar tactic with E., who kept the light on when I wanted to sleep. By hum a tune repeatedly, I managed to get her to change her ways. This experience is teaching me self-control, showing me that even the challenges at Warwick Hall are helping me grow.|"1. What does the speaker find frustrating about their roommate?

I can hardly believe that three whole months have passed since the Christmas holidays. School work was tough at times, but there was always fun mixed in, making time fly by. In New York for five days, time has whizzed by. Miss 'Henry' has made our stay enjoyable. She hosted a studio reception to introduce us to her famous friends. Betty received encouragement from Mrs. LaMotte, a magazine illustrator, who wants to illustrate Betty's next story. It was amazing to see Joyce playing hostess to such a distinguished group. They were friendly and extraordinary in their conversations. I helped serve refreshments and poured tea. Joyce noticed a change in me, saying I had grown up. We went sightseeing, attended matinees, and dined out. Phil took us on a tour in his car, and we're looking forward to visiting Eugenia's. Joyce came in with letters, bringing a pleasant end to our day.|"1. What did Miss 'Henry' do to make the speaker's stay enjoyable in New York?
