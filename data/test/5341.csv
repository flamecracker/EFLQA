"Eric laughed heartily as he swung down the long hill road. Earlier that day, his fourth-grade student John Reid, usually serious, chose ""Courting"" as his composition topic. John's opening line, ""Courting is a very pleasant thing which a great many people go too far with,"" never failed to amuse Eric. The spring landscape with its hills, woods, and fields painted a serene backdrop. As Eric strolled, he encountered locals on horseback and in carts, exchanging greetings. A young girl caught his eye, hinting at a potential friendship. Further down, a woman in an old wagon shared stories about her son, Sandy, whom she described as stubborn but promised to support Eric in disciplining him. At the foot of the hill, Eric noticed a boy and a man with distinctive features, giving off an air of mystery and intrigue."|"1. What was John Reid's composition topic?

The large orchard was enclosed by a weathered fence, with tall fir trees at intervals. An evening wind sang through the trees, carrying a soulful melody. To the east, a dense fir wood rose like a green wall. Most of the orchard was lush with grass, but at one end was a treeless area that seemed like a former garden. Lilac trees blossomed in purple and white, surrounded by fragrant June lilies. Roses were yet to bloom. The charm of the orchard captivated Eric, drawing him in with its beauty. He walked through the avenue, adorned with delicate blooms, and settled by a lilac bush, enjoying the view of a distant house. The sunset painted the sky with saffron and rose hues, filling the air with fragrance. Suddenly, music from a violin enchanted Eric, resonating with the spirit of harmony.|"1.

The realization of his escape from sudden and violent death had not yet had any opportunity to take possession of his thoughts. “We must forgive him, Mr. Gordon.

It was an evil impulse to which he gave way in his suffering--and think of the good which has resulted from it.” “That is true, Master, but it does not alter the terrible fact that the boy had murder in his heart,--that he would have killed you.
