The second mate explained to Mivins about the immense ice formations that cover mountains in places like Norway and Switzerland, extending for miles and sometimes filling up valleys. He described a glacier in Norway that filled a valley eight miles long, two miles wide, and hundreds of feet deep. These glaciers are always moving, although very slowly. Mivins was fascinated by the information but was interrupted by Davie Summers, asking about setting the table. Soon after, the crew had to navigate through ice and storms, encountering walruses, huge creatures resembling elephants. Fred wanted to collect a walrus skull but had to prepare for an approaching storm. The crew faced challenges as the weather worsened, and their ship was at the mercy of the elements.|"4.

With difficulty, the ship navigated through treacherous ice, squeezed by rolling masses. Attempts to set sail failed due to unmanageable ice. Forced to drift before the wind, the crew watched as the narrowing strait filled with grinding ice. As they neared looming ice, a strange vessel appeared, unmanned and adrift. Suddenly, the ship collided with a massive ice chunk, losing its anchor. Driven by the gale, the ship scraped against thick ice. A nearby vessel was crushed between closing ice masses, sinking in minutes. The crew, facing a similar fate, found hope when a crew member secured the ship to a drifting iceberg, narrowly escaping destruction.|"1. What caused the ship to fail in setting sail?

Dumps and Poker were two remarkable dogs with distinct personalities. Dumps, with a solemn expression, never smiled and had a thieving nature. Poker, on the other hand, was a mischievous wag who loved to explore and steal things. Despite their differences, they were best friends and favorites among the crew. These two dogs were bought by Captain Guy in Upernavik, along with a team of six Esquimau dogs. Dumps, with a dirty brown coat and black spots, and Poker, a pure white dog with a missing tail, were exceptional in appearance and character. They later became the reliable leaders of the dog team during their Arctic adventures. One day, after a feast of stolen pork, Dumps and Poker were caught napping, leading to a humorous incident involving the ship's cook.|"1. What was one of Dumps' characteristics mentioned in the text?

The men on the ship played football differently from boys in England. They kicked the ball hard, not caring much about direction. Collisions were common as they rushed for the ball.

As they journeyed, Fred and Singleton encountered a vast expanse of fixed ice resembling a road of hard white marble at the base of towering cliffs. Fred, with a humorous grin, attempted to shoot a beautifully marked sea-gull. Employing the art of stalking, he crept closer to his target with patience and precision. Despite his initial failure to hit the gull, Fred bagged several fine specimens of gulls and an auk. Meanwhile, Singleton explored the area, discovering green mosses and vibrant flowers amid the cold Arctic landscape. The rocks in the region were primarily red sandstone, interspersed with green-stone and gneiss formations. Their adventure culminated in a breathtaking sight as they rounded a cape and beheld a spectacle unique to the Arctic - a vast expanse of icy strait adorned with floes, fields, and bergs, teeming with flocks of wild-fowl. The scene was a mesmerizing blend of icy grandeur and natural beauty that left the young explorers in awe.|"1. What did Fred attempt to shoot during their journey?

By September 10th, the young ice connected last year's floes, making the ship's ice surroundings immobile. The crew saw hummocks near rocky islets, and the tide covered the rocks with crystals. Most birds left for milder places, except for the snow-bird. A severe storm arrived, filling the sea with icebergs. After the storm, snow covered everything, creating a pure white landscape, except for the steep cliffs and the flagstaff. The storm cleared, leaving a wintry sky. Captain Guy announced the start of hard work, prompting Fred to joke about their recent endeavors. The crew, dressed as Polar bears, prepared for their tasks ahead."|"6.

In recounting how the banished men spent their Arctic winter, it might seem like amusement was their main focus, but in truth, they had little time for it. The darkness, lack of regular work, and harsh climate took a toll on their spirits. To stay warm, they padded the ship's deck and walls with moss, plastered the floors, and covered them with oakum and canvas. Snow-drifts helped insulate the ship, and a canvas awning was added. A snow staircase and inclined plane aided sledges. The sledge they rode was Esquimaux-made, held together by raw seal-hide lashings. The whip was a formidable weapon with a 20-foot seal-skin lash. The hunters, dressed in Esquimau attire, carried provisions, harpoons, muskets, spears, cooking-lamp, tarpaulins, and blanket sleeping-bags on their expedition.|"1.

Meetuck quickly grabbed his harpoon and charged at the struggling walrus, with Fred and O'Riley following suit with a gun and another harpoon. West stayed behind to control the dogs. As Meetuck approached the edge of the ice, the walrus regained some strength and attempted to attack him. Meetuck plunged the harpoon deep into the walrus's chest and held on as it dived.

The ice-belt is a strip of ice running along the shore from the North's unknown regions. It remains in the latitude our travelers reached, following the curves of bays and rivers, increasing in winter and shrinking in summer but never fully melting. The ice's surface is covered with huge rocks that fell from the cliffs above. As they drove, West pointed out how the ice carried these rocks to sandy shores far from any other rocks. They encountered oddly shaped icebergs, some over a mile long, recently broken off from the North's glacier. They had to backtrack due to a narrow ice path, and as snow fell heavily, the dogs slowed. Despite these challenges, they pushed on towards their ship, their beloved home, as the dark months approached, bringing perpetual night to the Bay of Mercy.|"1.

The dogs felt the absence of light deeply and drew closer to their human companions on Store Island. Despite a warm kennel built for them, the dogs preferred staying near the ship, even sleeping on the snow by its side. O'Riley tried to coax them back to the kennel with no success until a piece of walrus meat lured them. The dogs finally settled down, but when O'Riley tried to leave, they followed him back to the ship. Later, Dumps was found resting in the middle of the pack using Poker's back as a pillow. The crew adjusted to life on the ship, with the cabin reorganized for warmth and comfort.

In this cozy place, the ship's crew ate, slept, and lived together. Despite the snug appearance, they struggled to stay warm enough for comfort. When the fire dwindled, frost coated the beams.

A fierce hurricane struck the Arctic Regions, confining the snow-village inhabitants to their huts for two days. The wind howled, whipping snow-drifts like sheets of white flame.

The Esquimaux cooked their meat over a moss and blubber fire and melted snow using a stone contraption. Despite the storm, the sailors and Esquimaux made the best of their situation. The sailors sought fresh food by traveling north with their dogs and sledge, burying provisions for the return journey. The northern party, led by Bolton and including Fred, Peter Grim, O'Riley, and Meetuck, made good progress, hoping to find walruses or seals.|"1. What natural disaster struck the Arctic Regions?

I sailed into Baffin's Bay and had a successful year fishing, but got stuck in the ice for two winters. On our way home, a storm blew us north. Our ship sank, leaving only me and one man alive. We made it to land, where the Eskimos helped us. Sadly, my companion Wilson passed away from illness. I learned their language and lived among them comfortably until a bear fight left me with a broken leg. Despite the hardships, I found solace in the Bible my mother gave me from the wreck. It brought me hope and strength. Captain Ellice shared many tales with Fred, but we must skip over them. The crew's adventures and the days in the Eskimo village were eventful. We returned to the _Dolphin_ with the Eskimos, and the scene was lively. The Eskimos built snow huts around the ship, bringing life back to the Arctic stillness. The change lifted everyone's spirits, but Joseph West's battle with scurvy cast a shadow over the joy. Despite efforts, he succumbed to the disease.|"1.

During the final days of his illness, Captain Ellice was a source of great comfort and a constant companion to Joseph West. He read passages from the Bible to him and encouraged him to turn to Jesus during moments of doubt and fear.

Captain Ellice reminded him of the significance of prioritizing spiritual matters, especially the salvation offered by Jesus. West acknowledged his past sins but found hope in the belief that Christ came to save sinners. After West's passing, his body was laid to rest on Store Island in a tomb made of stones. The crew, deeply affected by the loss, celebrated New Year's Day with subdued reverence, reflecting on West's death and their own mortality. The day was marked by prayers, a heartfelt address from the captains, a modest feast, and quiet reminiscences. The crew found solace in each other's company and hopeful discussions about their future. As the sun slowly returned to the Arctic after a long winter, the men were filled with joy and gratitude, appreciating the light that sustained both them and their animal companions.

Some of the articles in the Arctic Sun were serious, while others were cheerful, but all were beneficial. Fred ensured they were filled with interesting or amusing content. The newspaper was eagerly anticipated and thoroughly read by the crew, boosting their morale. Rat-hunting was no fiction; it was a real necessity due to the ship's rat infestation. The rats were everywhere, causing havoc and proving difficult to catch. To combat this, the crew made bows and arrows to hunt and eliminate the rats. Initially, the rats became food for the dogs, but as resources dwindled, the crew resorted to eating them, along with Arctic foxes, to stave off scurvy. Despite the challenges, the crew's spirits were lifted by acts of camaraderie and support. Captain Guy and his officers selflessly cared for the crew, ensuring survival through unity and service.|"1.
