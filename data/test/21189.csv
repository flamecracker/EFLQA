A clever hare, chased by dogs, sought refuge in a thorny bramble. Although the thorns pricked him, they kept the dogs at bay. The hare, enduring the discomfort, understood that good and bad often come together. Meanwhile, a sly mouse spotted a cat nearby and wisely avoided it. The cat, impressed by a beautiful but brainless mask, learned that beauty is not everything. Another tale tells of a man who greedily killed his egg-laying goose for more riches, only to find it empty. Similarly, a fox, failing to reach grapes, dismissed them as unripe rather than admit defeat.
