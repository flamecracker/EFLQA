The grassy area behind the cottage was a vibrant green, shimmering with morning dew. Smooth and well-kept by a garden roller and a goat's nibbling, it was a lively spot. The goat's kid, full of energy, loved to dance and frolic around. One day, an Italian boy arrived playing a pipe and drum, with dancing dolls on a board. The kid, hearing the music, leaped and danced joyfully. Little Mary, enchanted by the spectacle, admired the kid's playful moves. As the Italian boy left, the goat and kid continued to dance to the fading sounds of the music. In another tale, young birds learning to fly faced mishaps when overcrowded in nests. A hedge-sparrow nest incident with haymakers in a field led to chirping and fluttering, causing two chicks to tumble out, one landing in the hedge. The mother bird guided one chick back, while the other chirped sadly below, yearning for its nest.|"1. What is described as a lively spot behind the cottage?
