In ancient times, even scholars believed that flying dragons were mere myths. However, in the last twenty-five years, we have discovered fossils of creatures known as Pterodactyles, which people now acknowledge as flying dragons. The lesson here is that just because we have not seen something does not mean it does not exist. For example, wise men once thought locomotives were impossible until they saw them. Similarly, just because we have not seen water-babies does not mean they are not real. There are numerous water creatures like water-rats, water-flies, and even sea-lions. Nature is full of surprises, and the unknown should not be dismissed simply because we have not witnessed it. So, the next time someone doubts the existence of water-babies, remind them that the world is full of wonders waiting to be discovered.|"1. What is the main idea of the passage?

"Dear young reader, until you understand nature better than Professors Owen and Huxley combined, don't dismiss wonders as impossible. Old David said, ""We are fearfully and wonderfully made,"" and so is everything around us, even a simple table.

Tom heard a peculiar sound coming from up the stream. It was a mix of cooing, grunting, whining, and squeaking, like a bag containing two stock-doves, nine mice, three guinea-pigs, and a blind puppy making music. Looking upstream, Tom saw a strange sight - a large ball rolling down the stream, appearing alternately as soft brown fur and shining glass. Upon closer inspection, Tom discovered that the ball was actually four or five magnificent creatures, much larger than himself, swimming, rolling, diving, and playing joyfully in the water. However, a large otter among them saw Tom and menacingly approached him. Tom quickly hid among the water-lily roots, making faces at the otter. The otter taunted Tom, boasting about hunting fish and the upcoming salmon run. She warned Tom that the salmon would eat him, which made Tom retreat further into hiding. The otter then shared her disdain for humans, describing how they harm otters and other sea creatures. After the otter left, Tom encountered seven terrier dogs chasing after her.

Do not trust Dennis, as he tends to give pleasant but unreliable answers. Instead of getting upset, remember he may not know better due to his background. Laugh it off, and he will too, eager to help and entertain you. Dennis might even tell tall tales, wondering why things aren't as good in Ireland as in other places. Imagine a beautiful salmon river in Wales, devoid of salmon due to poaching. Contrast this with the hope of seeing abundant fish in Hampshire under new fishing laws. Picture a serene stream with vibrant scenery where you can fish peacefully, appreciating nature's beauty. Engage with a knowledgeable guide, like a Scottish gilly, who values honesty and shares wisdom. Take in the surroundings, interact with wildlife, and learn from the experience. This idyllic setting is reminiscent of Bewick's illustrations, capturing the essence of a quintessential English gentleman.|"1. What is Dennis known for in the text passage?

In the warm Carolinas, among sandbanks and pine trees, the narrator encountered owl-rays resembling giant bats, leaping in the tides. Wandered northward along the warm gulf-stream, meeting cold icebergs, getting entangled and chilled. Rescued by water-babies, now recovering but feeling sick and sad, unsure of returning home.

The professor was desperate for a water-baby to drive away the monsters tormenting him. His colleagues offered all sorts of bizarre treatments, from metallic tractors to spirit-rapping, but nothing worked. Finally, the professor wrote a book claiming the moon was made of green cheese and populated by baby mites waiting to come to Earth as siblings. This strange theory brought him relief from his troubles. He realized the importance of humility and wisdom. Later, he encountered a lobster trapped in a cage, regretting his foolish actions. The lobster's inability to escape taught the professor that experience is useless without the wisdom to apply it. Ultimately, a wise old lady appeared, ready to teach the professor a lesson for meddling with her plans.|"1. What did the professor claim in his book about the moon?
