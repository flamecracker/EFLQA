"Dear Red Riding Hood,

Your grandmother is unwell and cannot have butter. Please be quiet, shut the door gently, and fetch my writing desk. I plan to write to Aunt Charlotte about your possible visit to Hilltop.

Flaxie, in her excitement, dropped everything, including the butter. Unaware of her noise, she was sent away for being too loud. She decided to write to her cousin, explaining her situation and seeking permission to visit.

Flaxie packed her belongings in a brown canvas valise, ready for her trip to Hilltop. She was prepared with her umbrella and dolls, but some items went missing as she waited.

As Flaxie left for Hilltop, her mother advised her to be well-behaved like her cousin Milly. Flaxie pondered the differences in how mothers perceive their daughters and looked forward to Aunt Charlotte's warm welcome.

At Hilltop, Flaxie found the place covered in snow, making it even more beautiful. She enjoyed spending time with her cousin Milly and appreciated the kindness of Johnny, who pulled them on his sled.

The school at Hilltop, led by Miss Pike, was delightful despite some teasing from classmates. Flaxie and Milly admired Miss Pike for her bravery in saving the school from a fire.

Overall, Flaxie's visit to Hilltop was filled with fun and learning, and she cherished the time spent with her family and friends.
