Two years ago, I worked for the Hudson's Bay Company near McKenzie's River. Feeling lonely with little food and few people around, I decided to leave. On my way to Lake Winnipeg, I met a brigade of boats heading to the Saskatchewan district. One guide had a daughter named Marie Laroche, whom I fell in love with at first sight. Her father agreed to our marriage but insisted I first establish a home in Canada. Now, I'm on my way to claim my bride.

Ducks and gulls began to stir as the sky turned from pale yellow to red. Some birds lazily chirped their morning tunes while others startled and took flight. The sunrise painted the world in golden hues, warming everything in its glow. The birds filled the air with their lively calls, creating a pleasant chorus.

His attention then turned to a tin kettle, hinting at boiled meat, until his squaw intervened. She whispered to him, prompting a gesture towards a bright scarlet cloth. As he continued, the trader guided him, suggesting twine for nets, powder, axes, cloth, knives, and more. Eventually, his sticks depleted. The chief received his goods with satisfaction.
