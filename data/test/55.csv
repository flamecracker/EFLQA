"Dorothy was amazed as she listened to the speech of the little woman. She couldn't understand why she was being called a sorceress and accused of killing the Wicked Witch of the East. Dorothy was just a harmless girl who had been carried far from home by a cyclone and had never harmed anyone in her life.

The little old woman explained that although Dorothy hadn't killed the witch directly, her house had, which was just as significant. The woman revealed herself as the Witch of the North and explained that the Wicked Witch of the East had held the Munchkins captive for years, and now they were free thanks to Dorothy.

The Witch of the North clarified that not all witches were wicked, and in the Land of Oz, there were only four witches. She mentioned that the Wicked Witch of the West was the only remaining evil witch in the land.

Dorothy was intrigued and wanted to ask more questions, but the Munchkins interrupted, pointing out the remains of the Wicked Witch of the East. The Witch of the North then gifted Dorothy the silver shoes that belonged to the deceased witch.

It was revealed that in the Land of Oz, witches and wizards still existed because the land was isolated from the civilized world. Dorothy learned about the Wicked Witch of the West ruling over the Winkies and how dangerous her territory was."|"1. What was Dorothy's initial reaction to the speech of the little woman?
