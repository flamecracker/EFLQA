Dad inspired me with new thoughts about the father of his country, George Washington. I used to picture him crossing the Delaware in a skiff, but now, thanks to Dad, I see Washington as a planter, a neighbor, and a regular guy. I imagine him breaking colts, drinking buttermilk, and even asking Martha for a brandy smash. It's more fun to think of Washington camping out down the Potomac, fishing and cooking his own meals, than at a fancy state dinner. If we had a phonograph back then, we could hear Washington's conversations and maybe even some of his choice swear words. Dad and I had a funny incident at Mount Vernon, but it ended with a narrow escape from smallpox scare. Dad's mistaken for a rich man at the Waldorf-Astoria, and we had an extravagant dinner experience that almost broke the bank.|"1.

I used to picture him crossing the Delaware in a skiff, but now, thanks to Dad, I see Washington as a planter, a neighbor, and a regular guy. I imagine him breaking colts, drinking buttermilk, and even asking Martha for a brandy smash. It's more fun to think of Washington camping out down the Potomac, fishing and cooking his own meals, than at a fancy state dinner. If we had a phonograph back then, we could hear Washington's conversations and maybe even some of his choice swear words. Dad and I had a funny incident at Mount Vernon, but it ended with a narrow escape from smallpox scare. Dad's mistaken for a rich man at the Waldorf-Astoria, and we had an extravagant dinner experience that almost broke the bank.|"4. What technology does the narrator wish they had back then to hear Washington's conversations?
A) Telephone
B) Television
C) Phonograph

"""No, sir, on the Irish plan,"" said the waiter. ""You pays for what you horders,"" and dad began to dig up. He looked at me as though I was to blame when he told me to order all there was in sight. Well, I have witnessed heart-rending scenes, but I never saw anything that would draw tears like dad digging down for that $43. The doctors at home had ordered excitement for dad, but this seemed to be an overdose, and I was afraid he would collapse.

All the other diners stood up and looked at dad, and a lot of waiters and bouncers surrounded him. Dad peeled off the bills to pay for the dinner, gave the waiter half a dollar, and smiled a sickly smile at the head waiter. I led him out of the dining-room, a broken-down old man. As we got to the lobby, where the horse show of dress-suit chappies was beginning the evening procession, I said to dad: “Next time we will dine out, I guess,” and at that he rallied and seemed to be able to take a joke, for he said: “We dined out this time.

If a court ever sentenced me to live in this town, I would appeal the case and plead for mercy. The thick fog here makes you feel like you're groping around like a blind person.

Dad's quick thinking saved the day, and we ended up having lunch with the detective. In London, we had more misadventures with baggage and transportation. Eventually, we found ourselves at the home of a wealthy man who longed for his American roots. Dad and the man bonded over their shared love for America.|"1.

"Dear Friend,

I received your letter yesterday, and it made me miss home. I wish I could be back with you, playing in the sand and having fun. Here in London, things are different. The people here seem hungry and discouraged. I went to a market this morning and saw how the working class struggles to afford even a simple meal. The White Chapel district is a rough place where people look like they would do anything for a drink. Gin seems to turn them into angry, unhappy individuals. It's a stark contrast to how we see drinking back home.

The Tower of London was an eye-opener. Learning about the history and seeing where the little princes were murdered by Richard the Third was chilling. Dad was so upset he wanted the place burned down. Life here feels somber, but we're trying to make the best of it. I'll write to you soon about our visit to the American minister.

Dad apologized to the man and explained that he assumed the boys had been killed a year or two ago. He then gave the man a dollar, which pleased him greatly. The Tower of London felt like an American slaughterhouse, where many kings and queens were beheaded. They showed us the axes and blocks used for beheadings, and where the heads fell.

Dad is in a terrible state here in Paris, France. We arrived in this town and the people seemed unable to speak, only making gestures and noises we couldn't understand.

The boat on the English Channel doesn't just roll or pitch; it does stunts like a crazy horse. The water boils, bubbles, and flows in all directions at once. The wind blows from all angles, hot when you're hot, freezing when you're cold. It's a dreadful experience.

"Dear Uncle,

I am writing to you from Monte Carlo, a place that makes me feel ashamed to put its name at the top of a letter to anyone who believes in honesty and decency.

One night, he went to a prayer meeting, but the next morning, he was dancing with a stranger in their underclothes, kicking so high that he got stuck on a gas bracket. Now they are planning to go to Monte Carlo to try their luck at breaking the bank.

Yours sincerely,

From chuck-a-luck to high-stakes roulette, it's a haven for gamblers. I'm not sure what led dad here, maybe a new friend from North Dakota he met at a dance in Paris. One night, he went to a prayer meeting, but the next morning, he was dancing with a stranger in their underclothes, kicking so high that he got stuck on a gas bracket. Now they are planning to go to Monte Carlo to try their luck at breaking the bank.

Yours sincerely,

We spent two days exploring Venice in gondolas, navigating the canals when the tide was low and waiting for it to rise. One evening, under the moonlight near the Rialto bridge, I decided to give my dad some excitement. The Rialto bridge, a meeting spot for lovers for centuries, stood elegantly over the Grand Canal. Surrounded by gondolas carrying the elite of Venetian society, the music set a romantic tone. Dad, feeling adventurous, attempted to steer a gondola. However, his attempt led to a comical mishap as both he and the gondolier fell into the canal. With a mix of English and Italian yells, they were rescued, but not before causing a spectacle. Despite the chaos, we continued our adventures, with dad's clothes now smelling like a fish market. Join us in Naples, where the sights and smells might remind you of home, but with a touch of ancient history waiting to be explored.|"1. What did the speaker and their dad do near the Rialto bridge?

Dad was left hanging onto the camel, yelling for help. Eventually, we all made it to the pyramids. Dad was brave but got scared during the ride. The Arabs wanted money for the camel Dad rode, so he paid up. We climbed the pyramids, and Dad was glad to leave Egypt after the crazy camel adventure. Praying Arabs robbed us but prayed before and after stealing. Dad had a tough time with the camel ride but was relieved to head back home.|"6.

Dad and I embarked on a daring climb up the pyramid, but his struggles led to a hilarious yet chaotic adventure inside. As we ventured into the tomb, I decided to ignite my fireworks, causing a frenzy among the guides and tourists. The explosion sent everyone fleeing, and even the Arabs returned some of the money they had taken from us. Dad, in disarray, fashioned a turban into makeshift pants. After a boat trip on the Nile, we faced accusations of attempted sabotage, prompting us to flee in disguise. Gibraltar brought a sense of relief, especially hearing the Irish accent among the British soldiers. Dad praised the bravery of the Irish and criticized the mistreatment they faced. This experience fueled my desire to join the Fenians upon returning home.|"1. What caused the chaos inside the pyramid?

We left the palace while the king's helpers were cooling him down with ice water. They managed to calm him down after the cayenne pepper episode, and we saw him at the bullfight later.

The bull, however, didn't seem to understand and tossed him over the fence. The crowd cheered, mistaking Dad's intervention for bravery. Later, we visited the German Emperor, who surprised us by speaking English. He welcomed us warmly, and the young princes played with us, sharing stories of their mischievous pranks inspired by the Bad Boy tales.
