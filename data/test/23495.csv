The Messenians, moved by his sacrifice, rallied behind him and launched a surprise attack on the Spartans, resulting in a significant victory. The Spartans, realizing they needed divine help, sought an Athenian leader. To their surprise, they received a humble, unassuming schoolmaster named Tyrtaeus.

In ancient Greece, victors in the games were awarded medals and wreaths of wild olive and laurel leaves. The people no longer wore crowns of flowers or made sacrifices to the old gods as Greece had become a Christian country. Among the celebrated athletes was Milo of Croton, known for his incredible strength. He trained rigorously from a young age, even carrying a calf daily to increase his muscle.

Thespis, a clever Greek, saw the growing popularity of entertainment and built the first basic theater to please the audience. The initial shows were simple, with actors performing songs roughly.

Despite criticisms, actors persisted, attracting larger crowds. Eventually, poets wrote plays, enhancing the performances. The audience grew, leading to the construction of a massive amphitheater seating thousands. Greek actors wore masks and costumes, emoting through recitals and choral singing. Plays evoked varied emotions, from tears to laughter. The tragedies and comedies penned by renowned Greek playwrights are still read today.

In ancient Athens, Miltiades, a hero of the people after his victory at Marathon, faced envy from Themistocles, who grew jealous of his friend's success.

The new king, Xerxes, was persuaded by his courtiers and exiled Greeks in his palace to prepare for war against the Greeks. Despite his initial reluctance, he finally agreed to lead the army himself.

When Themistocles arrived in Sparta, he cleverly delayed discussions until the walls were high enough to defend. This angered the Spartans, who eagerly awaited a chance to punish the Athenians. Pausanias, the Spartan king, grew arrogant after his victory over the Persians. He became unbearable, donned Persian attire, and sought to rule Greece. The ephors uncovered his treachery, leading to his death by starvation in a temple. Themistocles, accused of involvement, was ostracized by the Athenians. Exiled, he found refuge with the Persian king, Artaxerxes. Despite the king's offer to lead a Persian army against the Greeks, Themistocles refused, remaining loyal to his homeland. Aristides, known as the Just, took charge after Themistocles' exile, overseeing public affairs until his death. His selflessness and integrity were later honored by the Athenians. Cimon, son of Miltiades, led the Athenian army to victories over the Persians and used the spoils to enhance Athens, including expanding the Academy gardens and bringing Theseus' remains to the city for burial.|"1.

During the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians faced a terrible plague that spread rapidly within the city walls. Thousands suffered from the disease, tormented by a burning thirst and left to care for themselves as the sick perished. Hippocrates, a noble doctor, received a message from the King of Persia asking for help with the same disease but chose to aid his fellow Athenians first. Despite the loss of many lives, Hippocrates' care and skill saved numerous sufferers, earning him a golden crown and the title of an Athenian citizen. Meanwhile, the death of Pericles, a respected leader, left a void in Athens. Nicias, his successor, though honest, was criticized for his indecisiveness compared to the revered Pericles.

Alexander greatly admired the poems he carried with him everywhere, even sleeping with them under his pillow. He kept the Iliad and the Odyssey in a box made of the finest gold.

Alexander's triumph surprised his citizens as they underestimated his capabilities. After three months of silence, the Greeks assumed Alexander had perished. The Thebans, seizing the opportunity, rebelled against Macedonian rule. However, Alexander swiftly defeated the Thracians and captured Thebes, sparing only the home of the poet Pindar.
