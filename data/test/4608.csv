The region was already depleted of circus animals, becoming more populated, and it was hard to hire native hunters like before. Eventually, Jake headed to the Argentine Republic along the Salado river, where he discovered something extraordinary. He hinted at finding a race of giant natives but mysteriously disappeared during his quest. Despite my efforts to locate him, the fate of Jake remains unknown, leaving behind a puzzling mystery.|"6.

A circus man approached Tom Swift with a unique request. He spoke of giants in the interior of South America and the mysterious disappearance of Jake Poddington.

Despite the challenges of air travel in the dense jungles, Tom was determined to embark on this extraordinary expedition. The circus man was thrilled by Tom's willingness to help and eagerly discussed the details of the daring adventure ahead.|"1. What did the circus man request Tom Swift to do?

The conversation was abruptly halted by loud voices from the large men. Oom signaled Tom, and they emerged from the woods onto a vast grassy plain, where big grass and mud huts clustered on the other side. This city wasn't extraordinary, much like others in wild South America or Africa. The natives gathered at a central market square, with huts stretching out like streets. Near the market square stood a large hut, likely the king's palace. Oom guided Tom and his group there, where they were to meet the chief ruler. The pack train with their supplies was behind them, and the townspeople surrounded them. Oom's shout was echoed by the giants kneeling down. The king emerged from his palace, towering over ten feet tall, flanked by men almost as large. The king blessed his people and beckoned Tom and his friends to sit. Tom faced the giant king fearlessly, believing showing no fear was the best approach. The king, named Kosk, questioned Oom, the chief hunter. Tom followed the narrative through gestures, even though the language was unknown. The king, accompanied by his brothers Tola and Koku, seemed to deliberate on their fate. Tom hoped to learn the language and offer to take one giant back to the United States. These South American giants were not just tall but also powerful with muscular builds, unlike historical giants.

Tom, with a flick of a switch, turned off the electric current. Instantly, the giant's arms relaxed, and the handles clattered to the ground. The other giants, curious, tried to free themselves but were held fast by the electricity's grip. Tom demonstrated his strength by lifting a heavy iron bar effortlessly. The giants, in awe, stared at him, realizing the power of the white man's magic. Tom urged them to inform their king to avoid the magic's wrath.

The king's giant brothers were approaching the captives' hut, wearing their royal jaguar skin garments. Tom urged his friend Ned to set up the electric battery and magnet for a plan involving a blasting powder bomb. By using the electric current, Tom successfully startled the giants.

The giants would lag behind, so provisions and hidden mules were readied for Tom and his friends to return to the coast after their flight. Tom ensured the aeroplane was ready for a swift departure.

Tom and his friends agreed to a plan to create a gangplank using ropes attached to key beams in a structure. As they pulled out the supports, the wall fell outward, forming a smooth runway for their aeroplane to take off. The giants were surprised by the sudden event, but fortunately, they did not attack.

After setting up camp, they decided to dismantle the aeroplane for transport. With provisions, blankets, and weapons, they planned to journey back to the United States.
