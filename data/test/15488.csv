In 1692, a child of Sarah Good, only 4 to 5 years old, was accused of biting people in Salem. On March 31, Abigail Williams claimed she witnessed a mock sacrament where bread was as red as raw flesh and the drink was red. Mrs. Cary's husband recounted her suffering in prison, with irons weighing eight pounds on her legs causing convulsions. As the hysteria escalated, 19 people were hanged, one pressed to death, and eight more were condemned. The economic impact led to people abandoning farms and moving southward, realizing the disastrous consequences of the witch trials. The Puritan clergymen were criticized for their role in the fanaticism, but eventually, a day of fasting and prayer was held to seek forgiveness for the tragic events. The blame shifted to Satan, relieving the ministers of responsibility for the dark period in American history.|"1.

In the early days of Virginia, church attendance and Sabbath observance were taken very seriously. For example, Sarah Purdy was indicted in 1682 for shelling corn on a Sunday, showing the strictness of the rules. The first General Assembly in Virginia even required citizens to attend divine services on Sundays, with fines imposed for those who didn't comply. In Georgia and the Carolinas, the influence of Methodism, Scotch Presbyterianism, and French Huguenots shaped religious life. Southern women, especially Methodists, played significant roles in the church. Southern attitudes towards religion were more balanced and peaceful compared to the North, with a sense of trust in God's love and a joyful afterlife. By the mid-18th century, religious sanity prevailed in both regions, with a strong belief in God's mercy and comfort. The Dutch in New York had a more matter-of-fact approach to religion, with little fervor but also lacking in bigotry. The New York parson had less influence compared to clergy in New England.|"1.

During the late 18th century, French influence in America was stronger than in the 17th century. Thomas Jefferson, influenced by French ideas, ensured that Southern elite daughters received diverse education. While sons went to English universities, daughters had private tutors, often university graduates, teaching languages and literature. Philip Fithian advised tutors to maintain impeccable conduct to earn the respect of women they taught. There is little information on education for Southern working-class women, but court records show high illiteracy rates. In Virginia, parish institutions began educational efforts, with ministers running schools and courts overseeing orphans' welfare. Wills from the 17th century show provisions for educating girls, highlighting the importance of education. Female illiteracy was high in the South during the 17th century, but by the 18th century, education became more widespread. In the middle colonies like Pennsylvania, schools were established early, emphasizing education for all. New England had a strong focus on education, with Harvard founded early on.

In the seventeenth century, women used various tools like darts, patches, and cosmetics to attract suitors. They even had cupids to place on lips, eyes, or cheeks. If unsuccessful, they were ridiculed in poems like the _Progress of Dullness_. Laws even regulated women's attire. As wealth grew, fashion became more elaborate, with costly fabrics like satin and silk. American women, during the Revolution, shed luxurious attire for humble homespun garments. Social life in the colonies varied from monotonous New England to more vibrant Virginia and South Carolina. The South, with its tobacco wealth, boasted lavish events. However, the constant pursuit of wealth led to soil exhaustion, pushing planters westward. This lifestyle hindered intellectual growth due to isolation from towns and schools. Washington's estate spanned thousands of acres, reflecting the widespread isolation of planters.|"1. What tools did women use in the seventeenth century to attract suitors?

"Dear Nancy,

I received your letter on July 25th just before heading to visit Mr. Washington in Westmoreland. I took my little pet with me and left Jackey at home to see how well I could manage without him. Even though we were only gone for a fortnight, I was eager to return home. I kept thinking I was being called back whenever I heard the dogs bark or any noise outside. We are expecting the kind ladies from Maryland to visit us soon. Please don't let your previous fright stop you from visiting me again. Give my love to Miss Judy and your little ones. Pass my regards to Mr. Bassett and Mrs. Dawson. Traveling in the past was slower and more important for social activities due to poor roads and long distances. Martha Washington's journey from Virginia to New York was filled with delays and kind encounters. Hospitality was key, even with stubborn horses and slow coaches. The eighteenth-century America showcased various stages of progress and a mix of cultures. In New England, amusements were limited due to strict Puritan views, emphasizing preparation for eternity. Despite the strictness, the early settlers were kind-hearted and community-oriented, showing genuine interest in each other's well-being and offering help in times of need. This community spirit led to a reputation for inquisitiveness that even astonished foreigners.

On February 10, 1687, Judge Sewall attended Lady Andros' funeral, describing the procession with soldiers guarding the way to the South Meeting-house. The next day, the mourning cloth was removed from the pulpit. In earlier New England colonies, scarfs, gloves, and rings were customary gifts for such occasions, but by Judge Sewall's time, this tradition was fading. In his diary, he recounts receiving gloves upon the death of a family member but finding them too small. The room for the funeral was draped in mourning, adorned with the family's escutcheons, and featured a richly embroidered canopy above the hearse. The procession included clergy, a squire bearing a shield, maidens in white silk, and mourners served with wines and sweets until late at night. The Puritans' interest in morbid and sensational details is highlighted, with a tendency to openly discuss crimes and offenders in the community.|"1.

"In the past, the Dutch had unique funeral customs that made even burials less somber. A bill from 1763 found among the Schuyler papers sheds light on how funerals were conducted. Women rarely attended the funeral in the ""dead room"" but stayed in an upper room to hear what was being said. The custom was to make funerals pleasant for visitors, as seen during the Revolutionary War when Tench Tilghman described a burial service in New York City. The funeral lacked ceremony but was followed by a gathering where guests enjoyed bottles, tankards, candles, pipes, and tobacco. As the English population grew in New York, the city transitioned to flashier forms of pleasure, departing from its quiet social life. The Schuyler residence, ""The Flatts,"" described in Grant's _Memoirs_, showcases the comfortable and wholesome life of wealthier natives."|"1.

In the early days of the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay Colonies, marriage ceremonies were likely conducted solely by magistrates. The Puritans of that time were wary of church rituals, often opting for simple weddings and funerals without the presence of a preacher. Over time, the choice of officiant expanded to include both clergy and magistrates, but weddings remained modest and unadorned. Judge Sewall, a prominent figure of the era, believed weddings were civil rather than religious events. He even attempted to pass a law allowing magistrates to officiate, but clergy members eventually gained the upper hand. Despite this, some couples, like Mr. Grove Hirst and Elizabeth Sewall, chose to be married by a clergyman. Wedding celebrations were typically understated, with simple refreshments like cake, wine, and beer being served. As societal norms evolved, weddings became more elaborate, with some even being described as riotous affairs. Laws surrounding marriage were stringent due to the presence of unscrupulous individuals who tried to deceive authorities by claiming to be unmarried. Instances of bigamy were not uncommon, leading to fines and other forms of punishment.|"1.

There were also severe penalties for adultery, including whipping, branding, banishment, and even death. Despite the high moral standards of most colonists, crime still occurred. Bold individuals and refugees brought immorality to the new commonwealths. Records by Sewall and Winthrop detail grave offenses. Adultery was punishable by death, and some women faced this penalty. Laws also targeted inter-marriage of relatives. While the death penalty for adultery ceased by Sewall's time, it was common in the 17th century. The Americans applied severe laws to protect society, even executing women for serious crimes. Sewall documented these executions without protest. The court records show punishments like whipping and public humiliation for married women convicted of adultery.|"6. What did the laws in colonial America target regarding marriage?

In the past, severe punishments were common for those who committed crimes deemed deserving of more than just a whipping. One form of punishment was branding, where a mark of disgrace was placed on the guilty party to serve as a permanent reminder of their sin. This mark, like the scarlet letter made famous by Hawthorne, was sometimes sewn onto clothing or burnt into the flesh. For example, in Plymouth in 1639, a woman was whipped through the streets and had to wear a badge on her sleeve. Failure to display the badge resulted in being burned with a hot iron. Similarly, a man and woman were whipped in public and had to wear the letters AD for adultery on their clothing. These punishments aimed to publicly shame individuals and deter others from committing similar offenses. Such practices were once common, reflecting the strict social norms of the time.|"1.

In early American history, interracial relationships faced severe consequences. In Virginia, the mixing of races was condemned, and laws were enacted to prevent it. For instance, if a female servant had a child out of wedlock, she would be punished with public whipping and a hefty fine. If the child was of mixed race, the consequences were even harsher. The child would be bound as a servant until reaching adulthood. The law in 1691 even banished any white woman who married a person of color. Despite efforts to curb such relationships, immorality persisted across the colonies. Prominent figures like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were known to have had illegitimate children.
