"**Dickie Deer Mouse's Search for a Summer Home**

Dickie Deer Mouse was a charming little creature, always elegantly dressed in fawn color and white. He moved gracefully through the woods, his small white feet twinkling as he frolicked among the trees. His sharp cries echoed through the forest, much like the squirrels, his distant friends.

Eager to secure a home closer to Farmer Green's cornfield, Dickie hurried to claim Mr. Crow's old nest.

One day, Dickie Deer Mouse woke up feeling unusually flexible. Instead of his usual routine of springing out of bed to find food, he considered going back to sleep. To his surprise, the pasture had transformed overnight, covered in a thick blanket of snow. Luckily, a crust had formed, allowing Dickie to venture into the spruce woods to hunt for supper. He felt hungrier than usual, having unknowingly slept for several days. Before returning home, he hid some spruce seeds in a fence rail, knowing food would become scarce in winter. The early snowstorm served as a warning, prompting Dickie and his cousins to gather enough nuts and seeds for the coming winter. As the cold season arrived, Dickie's food stash dwindled, and he worried about finding more food. The birds had already eaten most of the nuts, leaving Dickie to ponder his next meal.|"3.
