"""Great job, captain!"" Nat praised. ""I never thought a young guy could handle a paddle so well on his first try. He rowed almost the whole way, except for the narrows.

After nightfall, the group set out on their canoes once more, paddling for hours to cover a greater distance than before. They aimed to land six miles below where Lake George meets Lake Champlain, near the French fort construction site. The plan was to carry the canoes seven to eight miles through the woods to reach Lake Champlain's east shore, bypassing Ticonderoga. Progress was slow due to rugged terrain and the need for caution to prevent damage to the canoes. By late afternoon, they reached Lake Champlain, lit a fire, and crossed the lake, passing Ticonderoga. As they approached the French shore, they discovered their canoes had been sabotaged. Despite the setback, they pressed on, aware that their safety was now paramount.|"1. What was the group's initial plan after leaving Lake George?

"""Men, let's move quickly. More canoes are coming, likely manned by Indians who paddle well but can't row,"" Rogers advised.

The men we tracked are fishing in the water, but The Owl is certain they are not from our tribe. He suggests sending three brothers in a canoe to fish beyond them while the rest wait. If the men come back, they will be seized. If they move further, the brothers will call out to other canoes to cut them off. The plan is to wait until it's nearly nightfall as the redskins are patient and won't interfere as long as they see no attempt to escape. James struggles to focus on fishing, knowing they are being watched by hostile eyes. The Indians in the other canoe exchange a few words with the fishing party but nothing more happens. Hours pass slowly as the fish bite, and Nat and Jonathan stay focused on their task without looking towards the canoes. The redskins seem ready to make a move soon.|"1.

The canoe approached slowly, until it was within thirty yards. James and his companions continued fishing, seemingly unaware of the approaching canoe until an Indian spoke. In an instant, the rifles were aimed at the Indians, who, surprised, dove overboard. The canoe sharply turned and sped away, while rifles from the shore and war cries filled the air.

The Native Americans were now paddling even harder to catch up with the canoe, which was now being rowed by only two people.

As darkness fell, they were more than half a mile ahead. To avoid being seen by their pursuers, they paddled silently towards the western shore. They then quietly approached the shore, hid the canoe, and rested. After a while, they resumed their journey, paddling quietly to avoid detection. They eventually made their way back to the eastern shore, where they continued their journey through the forest, guided by the bark of the trees.

"""Yes, Captain, you can talk, but keep it quiet. We don't want any nearby Native Americans to hear us. These forests are probably full of them. I'm sure every Native American and Canadian group is after us tonight. The war cries and guns have put them on alert. They may have set up canoes across the lake from Crown Point, expecting us to head back or go into the woods. Most of the Native Americans near Crown Point will have crossed over to this side, assuming we would land here. I thought about landing on the other side, but there are likely many Indians coming from Montreal on that side. We'll have a tough time getting away from them. By doubling back, we've outsmarted them. They'll search the lake edge in the morning, but it's a long stretch. If we're lucky, they won't find our landing spot until hours after daylight. We'll have a head start of twenty miles through the woods, crucial when pursued by Native Americans. If we avoid them, we might return safely to Fort William Henry.

I thought about landing on the other side, but there are likely many Indians coming from Montreal on that side. We'll have a tough time getting away from them. By doubling back, we've outsmarted them. They'll search the lake edge in the morning, but it's a long stretch. If we're lucky, they won't find our landing spot until hours after daylight. We'll have a head start of twenty miles through the woods, crucial when pursued by Native Americans. If we avoid them, we might return safely to Fort William Henry. At dawn, they set off, moving carefully to avoid leaving obvious tracks. After ten miles, they turned south, feeling safer. They were likely ahead of any pursuers, giving them a good chance of reaching the hidden canoe and escaping unnoticed."""|"Question 5: What does the speaker mean by saying, ""They were likely ahead of any pursuers""?

Nat expressed disdainfully that the outcome depended on the type of men involved. He believed that knowledgeable men wouldn't be caught off guard, unlike those who jumped out of their boats carelessly, risking an ambush by Indians.

In contrast, James calmly directed his men to prepare for defense. He instructed them to lay in the oars, except for the bow oars, and stand armed while the boats followed each other closely. The men in the boats, including James, fired accurately at the approaching canoes, causing casualties among the attackers.

The following day, the weather remained stormy. Despite the fog on the 6th, the wind calmed down by noon, prompting the troops to prepare for landing. However, as they readied themselves, the wind picked up again, causing rough seas and delaying the landing. The next day, the heavy surf persisted, but in the evening the sea calmed. Orders were given for the troops to board the boats early the next morning. The troops, including Wolfe's division, faced a challenging landing at Fresh Water Cove, where French forces were well-prepared with cannons. Despite a deadly hail of fire, Wolfe signaled a retreat, but some boats misunderstood and landed directly in the line of fire. The English forces eventually managed to establish a foothold, forcing the French to retreat. The English camp was set up beyond the range of French cannons, with ongoing efforts to land siege guns and establish defensive positions.|"1. What caused the delay in the troops' landing?

After silencing the battery on the islet, the English fleet had a clear path to engage the French ships and town from the harbor. However, the French took advantage of a dark, foggy night and sank six ships across the entrance. The English troops fortified themselves under heavy fire. Wolfe led a detachment to build a redoubt.

The army encountered French forces near the lake, leading to a skirmish where Lord Howe tragically fell. Despite this loss, the Rangers and Royal Scouts managed to defeat the French troops. The death of Lord Howe left a void in leadership, causing disorder within the British army. Nonetheless, the troops continued their mission with determination and bravery.|"1.

The loss of the brave young general was a devastating blow to the army. Abercromby was unable to act, and the soldiers were kept on alert needlessly.

On the 8th of July, a group of ships positioned themselves in front of General Levis' camp, located on the heights by the Saint Lawrence near Montmorenci Gorge. They bombarded the camp with shells until nightfall. Although the elevated plateau of the camp protected them from significant damage, Wolfe's aim was to keep the enemy engaged. As evening approached, troops from the island disbanded their camp, leaving a marine detachment behind. Brigades Townshend and Murray, totaling three thousand soldiers, boarded boats after dark and landed near Montmorenci. By daybreak, they ascended the heights, defeated Canadian and Indian forces, and began fortifying their position. A group of rangers scouted the forest to prevent the enemy from gathering resources and to find a river crossing. Levis and his aide-de-camp observed Wolfe's movements. Johnston discovered a ford, leading to a confrontation where English forces repelled attacking Indians. Despite missed opportunities, the English held their ground, forcing the Canadians to reconsider their strategy.|"1. What was the main objective of the ships bombarding General Levis' camp?

On the night of the 28th, the French tried to set fire to the English fleet. They sent down many boats and rafts filled with flammable materials. The fire was delayed this time, putting the English fleet in danger. Despite heavy fire from the French, English sailors managed to tow the burning boats to shore.

Wolfe had a two-fold objective: to make the militia abandon their posts and to deplete the colony's resources. His troops, including rangers and Highlanders, were ordered to attack settlements and destroy them. Despite this destruction, churches were mostly left unharmed.

""It's too risky,"" he told the midshipman. ""We need to find a hiding spot. It's been hours since we started, and we can't explore further until morning."" After some searching, they found a concealed spot shielded by bushes to rest. They shared a meager meal of bread and water. The next plan was to head towards a tented encampment nearby, where Canadian troops were stationed. James cautiously led the way down a clearer path, hoping to reach the river for water."|"1.

James suspected it was a strategic breastwork, and so they paused to listen for any approaching sentries. James warned his companion to be cautious as they approached a gap in the path, which was obstructed by felled trees forming an abattis. After overcoming this obstacle, they decided to continue along the foot of the precipice until they reached a safe location to signal for help. They climbed up to a higher spot above the river, planning to alert passing ships at dawn. As the ships neared, James displayed a signal, and the Sutherland acknowledged it.
