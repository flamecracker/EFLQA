She remembered the disoriented woman she had encountered during the storm on the mountain, who seemed to have lost control of her nerves and mind. Ruth began to wonder if she, too, was teetering on the edge of a breakdown. Had she deluded herself about the hermit's tale? Had she dwelled so much on her own losses that she was unable to make sound decisions? These thoughts unsettled the typically pragmatic Ruth Fielding. The hospital incident in France, detailed in ""Ruth Fielding Homeward Bound,"" had deeply affected her, causing her to shudder at the memories. She feared that her friends, even Tom and Helen, viewed her differently now. The idea that her grief had clouded her judgment about the hermit's story frightened her. Despite her worries, she kept silent on the matter, even as Helen brought up the topic of the Beach Plum Point ""hermit"" during lunch with friends at Reef Harbor House. Ruth couldn't help but feel anxious as they set sail to meet the hermit on Reef Island. The hermit greeted them warmly, revealing a toothless smile and a hint of alcohol on his breath. Ruth noticed that his eyes were watery and red. The man seemed unaffected by any shortage of alcohol in the area."|"**3. What incident in France deeply affected Ruth Fielding?**
