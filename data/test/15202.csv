Odysseus devised a clever plan to escape from the cave of the giant Polyphemus. He crafted a sharp stake from a massive club of olive wood, which his men fine-tuned. When the giant returned and blocked the cave entrance with a stone, Odysseus waited until Polyphemus slept. Then, he heated the stake in the fire and thrust it into the giant's eye, blinding him. As Polyphemus cried out in agony, Odysseus and his men fled. To further escape, Odysseus and his men tied themselves under the bellies of the giant's sheep. Polyphemus, unable to see, felt the sheep's backs but did not detect the hidden men. In the morning, the sheep left the cave, with Odysseus clinging to the leader. Polyphemus, suspecting nothing, let the sheep pass, unknowingly allowing Odysseus and his men to escape.|"1. What did Odysseus use to craft a sharp stake to blind Polyphemus?

Odysseus lay very still as the giant spoke, while the ram walked past towards the meadows near the sea. Once far enough, Odysseus stood up, freed the others, and rushed the rams to the shore where their ship awaited. They feared Polyphemus following, but reached the ship safely to a warm welcome from friends. Odysseus pushed the ship off, signaling the men to row hard to escape the giant's wrath. Out at sea, Odysseus taunted Polyphemus, who hurled a rock narrowly missing the ship. They sailed to the further shore where their friends waited in dread, relieved to see them alive. They feasted until dawn, then set sail again. They reached an island where the keeper of winds gave Odysseus a bag of winds. Mistaking it for treasure, the men released the winds, blowing them off course. Next, they encountered Circe, who turned the men into swine. Odysseus, angered, was eventually assured safe passage home by Circe. They stayed a year, then set sail, warned of dangers ahead. Among them were the Sirens, whose enchanting voices lured sailors to their deaths.|"1. What did Odysseus do after the ram walked past towards the meadows near the sea?
