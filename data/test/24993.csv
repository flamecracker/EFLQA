Rollo was heading home one morning after running an errand when he noticed a sizable wood pile near Farmer Cropwell's door. This sight brought back memories of a journey he took into the countryside with Jonas, who had shared stories with him and Lucy. On that trip, Jonas had shown Rollo the sweet sap of a maple tree. Intrigued, Rollo decided to check the woodpile's logs for sap. However, he soon realized that the logs were dry and not maple trees. Witnessing one of Farmer Cropwell's boys attempting to split a log using an axe, wedge, and beetle, Rollo observed how the log cracked open after the wedge was driven in. Despite the walnut being crushed during the process, the boy successfully split the log and then used a wooden wedge to widen the cleft further.|"**1.

Rollo examined the log carefully to understand why it crushed the walnut. He noticed that the log was not split entirely but had a crack that started from one end and almost reached the other. At one end, the log remained solid and whole. Rollo realized that the two halves were firmly held together at one end, making them spring back when separated. He saw splinters binding the sides tightly. The boy explained how a wedge works to split the log by spreading the wood apart. Rollo suggested widening the back of the wedge to open the wood further. They tested the theory by using a wooden wedge, but it failed. The boy demonstrated how a sharp iron wedge easily entered the crack to separate the log.|"1. Why did Rollo examine the log carefully?

Rollo was uncertain whether to be pleasant or not. Eventually, he chose to be good-natured. He realized that by sharpening his wedge uniformly, it would be more effective. He took the advice to heart and decided to make a perfect wedge. Even though he was eager to finish quickly, he understood the importance of taking his time to do it right. Rollo carefully smoothed the sides of the wedge with the hatchet and then sawed it off at the correct distance. After trimming the rough edges with his knife, he presented the well-made wedge to Jonas. Jonas advised Rollo not to rush and to complete his apparatus entirely before testing it.

Rollo decided to make an hour-glass for which he needed sand. He filled a basin with sand and water, stirring it to separate the sand from sticks and leaves. Rollo was amazed at how the water separated the light and heavy particles. After cleaning the sand, he spread it out to dry. Jonas saw Rollo's project and shared his own time-keeping method using a noon mark on the barn floor. By marking the shadow of the door post at noon, Jonas could always tell the time. He explained that shadows point north at noon, making it a reliable way to mark time accurately. Rollo was fascinated and wanted to create a similar noon line at his house. Jonas suggested using a compass needle to draw a north and south line for accurate timekeeping.|"1. What did Rollo need to make an hour-glass?

A few days later, Jonas decided to conduct an experiment. He gathered two narrow boards from an old picket fence, ensuring one end of each board was sharp to be driven into the ground. Choosing a spot in the yard away from the usual path but still visible from the barn, Jonas planned to create a sundial using the North Star. Understanding that a single stake might not stay in position, he opted for two boards. By driving the second board perpendicularly from the first and nailing them together, he aimed to keep the setup stable. In the evening, the boys set out under the starry sky. Jonas taught Rollo about the Dipper and how stars appear to move in circles around the North Star. They began aligning the boards towards the North Star to create their sundial, a task they would continue the next evening.|"1. What did Jonas gather for his experiment?

Rollo's father conducted an experiment to demonstrate the magnetic properties of a bar magnet to Rollo and his family. He showed that the attractive power of the magnet is concentrated at its ends, known as poles. By using a needle suspended by a thread, he illustrated how the needle only moved when the magnet's end was brought close to it. The experiment continued as sand was used to show how the magnetic force accumulated at the ends of the magnet, forming a cluster of sand. Rollo's mother observed that there was a slight difference in the accumulation of sand at each end, indicating that the magnetism at the two poles was of opposite natures. This experiment highlighted the distribution of magnetic power in a magnet and the unique properties of its poles.|"1. What was the main purpose of Rollo's father's experiment?

Rollo eagerly grabbed the bar and tried to brush the sand off the paper. Despite his efforts, most of the sand remained stuck. When he rubbed one side, it just moved to the other side, making it hard to clean. He then asked Jonas for the tongs by the fire. With the tongs, he tapped the magnet's end gently on them, letting it hang slightly over the edge. This action cleared all the sand, leaving the bar clean. Next, he cut a flat piece from a cork and made a groove to hold a needle. Placing the needle on the cork in a saucer of water, he explained that it's called a float, allowing the needle to move freely. Nathan found this experiment fascinating and watched the needle move about with keen interest. Rollo's father demonstrated how the needle reacted to the magnet's different ends, showing a distinct difference in their magnetic properties.|"1. What did Rollo use to clean the sand off the bar?

Mary observed the needle's movement attentively as it swung back and forth slightly past the meridian before gradually decreasing its distance each time until coming to rest, not exactly aligned with the meridian. She discussed dreaming during sleep with Rollo, suggesting that despite dreaming for hours, one might actually be sound asleep without any dreams. Mary proposed conducting experiments to explore this concept. Rollo decided to test this idea and asked Mary to study while he prepared for the experiments. They found a suitable spot under a tree where Mary tied pebbles to strings, demonstrating how the earth's attraction causes objects to fall in a curved path due to the string's constraint. Mary's experiments illustrated how gravity influences the motion of objects, leading to a better understanding of the phenomenon.|"1. What did Mary observe attentively in the text passage?

She discussed dreaming during sleep with Rollo, suggesting that despite dreaming for hours, one might actually be sound asleep without any dreams. Mary proposed conducting experiments to explore this concept. Rollo decided to test this idea and asked Mary to study while he prepared for the experiments. They found a suitable spot under a tree where Mary tied pebbles to strings, demonstrating how the earth's attraction causes objects to fall in a curved path due to the string's constraint. Mary's experiments illustrated how gravity influences the motion of objects, leading to a better understanding of the phenomenon.|"2. Who did Mary discuss dreaming during sleep with?

Mary explained the concept of a pendulum to Rollo by demonstrating an experiment. She held a pebble stone to stop it at the lowest point under the tree branch where a string was fastened. After releasing the pebble, it swung back and forth through an arc, propelled by the force it acquired. Mary noted the rapidity of the oscillations and proposed further experiments with different sized pebbles, strings, and arcs to observe the effects. She emphasized the importance of unbiased observation and conducting multiple experiments to understand the impact of different variables. Mary then set up two pebble stones, one large and one small, hanging from the tree branch to compare their oscillations. Rollo watched with interest as Mary carefully prepared the experiment.|"1.

After a few swings, the big stone started to move faster than the small one. Mary noted that even though they tried to make the stones identical, there might be hidden differences. To test if the stone's size affected the swings, Rollo picked a stone as big as an orange and suspended it. Initially, the stones swung together, but soon the differences became clear. They concluded that size didn't affect the speed of swings. Mary then chose two pebbles of almost the same size, tied them to strings, with one twice as long. When released, the shorter string swung faster, confusing their counting. They tried different lengths, from very short to very long, observing the varying swing speeds.|"Question 1:
