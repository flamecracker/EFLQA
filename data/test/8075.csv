Foxes, known for their cunning ways, surprisingly excel in caring for their young. Both parents are deeply involved in nurturing and teaching their offspring.

For several weeks, I immersed myself in the local culture, mingling with Egyptian officers, desert tribal leaders, and former Ethiopian royalty. Initially, Khartoum appeared drab to me, with its mud walls lacking any charm. I contemplated setting up camp in a garden instead of residing in the uninviting structures.

The house, constructed with mud-covered palm-logs, proved to be more comfortable than its exterior suggested. The consul's garden held unique surprises typical of Central Africa. Apes greeted me at the entrance, followed by a leopard, gazelles, hyenas, and even a lioness. Despite initial apprehension, I formed a bond with the animals, especially the lioness, who displayed a mix of dog-like playfulness and cat-like grace.|"1.

However, the consul's residence surprised me. Inside, the clean, well-appointed rooms offered a cool refuge from the scorching sun. The house, constructed with mud-covered palm-logs, proved to be more comfortable than its exterior suggested. The consul's garden held unique surprises typical of Central Africa. Apes greeted me at the entrance, followed by a leopard, gazelles, hyenas, and even a lioness. Despite initial apprehension, I formed a bond with the animals, especially the lioness, who displayed a mix of dog-like playfulness and cat-like grace.|"6.

When summer arrived and the London streets sizzled with heat, I decided to escape to the countryside. Wanting to share the joy, I brought Peter along, snug in his comfy travel basket equipped with air-holes and supplies. Our spirits soared as we embarked on this adventure. Peter discovered a whole new world, and the rural beauty captivated us both. We stayed at a farmer's quaint home, a mix of timber and brick, with cozy rooms. The heart of the house was the spacious kitchen, with its oak panels and neatly arranged pots and pans hinting at delicious meals. Peter quickly settled in, befriending a cat named Jack who introduced him to country life. Jack was a skilled hunter, especially at fishing, much like his master. Together, Peter and Jack explored the farm, engaging in playful antics and sharing an interest in the local wildlife. Their escapades were filled with excitement and camaraderie until our seaside journey beckoned, cutting short our idyllic countryside retreat.|"1.

Blackamoor, a mischievous bird, caused trouble by stealing items from the school. He was sly and hid his loot well. One day, he got into a scuffle with Italian workers near the school. The workers made camp nearby, and the kids were scared of them because they spoke a different language and carried knives. While the teacher thought it best to keep the students away from the workers, Blackamoor was drawn to their camp, likely enticed by food. Trouble escalated when an Italian chased Blackamoor, leading to a chaotic scene at the school. The Italians seemed to be upset with Blackamoor rather than the school.

One sunny day, as I roamed through rocky paths and swampy spots, admiring the vibrant flowers, I stumbled upon a beautiful sight.

As I walked through the bushes, blackbirds sang sweetly while song-sparrows filled the air with the raptures of spring. Startled curlews flew away, their long legs trailing behind, whistling fine tunes. The waves made a joyful noise, and the sea seemed to murmur in a gentle dream. Sheep scattered, washed white as snow, nibbled eagerly on new grass, while young lambs cried plaintively. A sandpiper emerged, seemingly injured, dragging itself as if every bone was broken. I realized the bird was tricking me to protect its nest. I found the nest near a bayberry bush, a simple yet pretty house holding four pale green eggs with brown spots. I couldn't help but admire the cunning of such a small bird. In another tale, a canary named Willie brought cheer to a sunny parlor, singing along with the sparrows and robins outside.|"1.

As I walked through the bushes, blackbirds sang sweetly while song-sparrows filled the air with the raptures of spring. Startled curlews flew away, their long legs trailing behind, whistling fine tunes. The waves made a joyful noise, and the sea seemed to murmur in a gentle dream.

I realized the bird was tricking me to protect its nest. I found the nest near a bayberry bush, a simple yet pretty house holding four pale green eggs with brown spots. I couldn't help but admire the cunning of such a small bird. In another tale, a canary named Willie brought cheer to a sunny parlor, singing along with the sparrows and robins outside.|"2.

I was in the boat surrounded by whales. They were spouting and leaping all around me, even beneath the surface. It was dark, but the stars shone brightly.

I hurriedly moved the keg to the back of the boat and struck it against the loggerhead. With each hit, the keg gave way until the head came off. The taste of the pilot-bread was delightful, reminding me of the water-keg in the whale-boat. After finding the keg secured beneath the midship thwart, I released it and quenched my thirst.

After breakfast, we set out on a four-mile journey through a forest without roads or paths. It was a perfect time for hunting as the frozen swamps and bare trees made it ideal. While tracking a deer, we stumbled upon a hedgehog that Willis shot, but we decided not to keep it. As we crossed Plancher brook, we discovered transparent ice covering pools with trout swimming beneath. Willis attempted to stun the fish with a gunshot under the ice, resulting in a successful catch. However, his gun split open during another attempt. After a disagreement, John and I devised a method using a board to mimic the concussion of a gunshot, allowing us to catch trout without harming them. In the end, we all worked together to secure a good haul of fish.|"1. What was the reason the characters found it to be a perfect time for hunting in the forest?

"""Now that we lack a Queen,"" the bees discussed, ""we must watch over the Princesses."" They fed the Princesses honey all day, causing them to grow into beautiful Queen Bees. When the ten Queen Bees emerged, the other bees admired them. A dispute arose among the Queen Bees about who was the prettiest, leading to a fierce fight. The bees decided to let them fight to see who was the strongest and would become the new Queen. After a long battle, only two Queen Bees remained. In the end, both stung each other to death.

We arrived in Rangoon around May 1st and took a train to Mandalay. From there, we journeyed slowly by construction-train to the Mogung Gorge. Throughout the trip, I hardly exchanged a hundred words with Lancy. Despite this, he never seemed to suspect any ill feelings from me. The gorge, a vast hole, was 250 feet wide and 200 feet deep, with the river rushing fiercely at the bottom. A cantilever bridge was planned to span the gorge. Our task was laid out for us, with all beams and girders prepared and coolies available for labor. We quickly got to work, setting up a temporary wire suspension-bridge and starting construction from both ends simultaneously. The gorge was also home to wild bees, whose nests lined the walls, creating a constant buzz that blended with the river's murmurs. These bees, though small, were aggressive and their stings were potent. One scorching morning, while working on the last beam, I encountered a swarm of wild bees hanging below, reminding me of the dangers lurking in the gorge.|"1.

I felt curious and interested at first. Then, the bunch started rising towards me, and I began to feel alarmed, remembering their painful stings. If they attacked me, I would be in trouble. Slowly, with a revolving motion and an intense, spiteful buzzing sound, the irregular mass kept rising. Its center seemed solid, and its outside frayed into separate bees drawn inward by a common attraction. As it floated nearer, my skin crept, and my brain was fascinated by the buzzing. I knew the swarm's concentrated misery for anyone who angered it. I sat perfectly still, hoping it would pass unharmed. Exclamations of alarm and sympathy reached me as work on the steel was suspended. Feet shuffled back to the bank, leaving me threatened by a death more horrible than any tiger or snake.|"1.

A strong smell of sulfur filled the air as I stood on a narrow beam high above the ground. Below me, a small black kettle swung, holding a burning yellow substance meant to drive away bees. The bees, however, were not pleased with the scent. They began to buzz ominously, their wings lifting and settling back. Despite the fumes being sweet to me for the relief they offered, the bees were becoming agitated. Suddenly, the kettle tilted, spilling the sulfur in a blue-burning stream, enraging the bees further. As they swarmed around me, stinging painfully, I struggled to make my way to safety on the beam.

Ants are fascinating creatures with unique behaviors and social structures. In England alone, there are over thirty species of ants, each with distinct habits. Ant colonies consist of males, wingless workers, and queen mothers. The queen ant can live up to fifteen years and is the heart of the colony. Workers carry out all tasks, from caring for the young to excavating tunnels. Some ant species have different classes of workers, each with specific roles. While soldiers with large heads and powerful jaws exist, they don't form a traditional army. Ants don't have rulers, but workers show respect and orientation towards the queen. In a study, even after accidentally killing a queen, worker ants displayed a sense of mourning by carrying her to a new nest and gathering around her. This behavior showcases the intricate social dynamics of these tiny insects.|"1. What is the role of the queen ant in the colony?

Ant communities can be huge, with up to 500,000 ants living together. It's fascinating that ants from the same community never fight each other. However, they are hostile towards ants from different communities or species. When introduced to a new nest, ants are attacked. Even after being separated for a long time, ants from the same nest recognize and are friendly towards each other. They seem to have a special way of identifying their nestmates. In an experiment, intoxicated ants were recognized and cared for by their sober friends. This shows that ants help each other, even in times of distress like when an injured ant is tended to by its fellow ants. This behavior shows a sense of kindness and community among ants.|"1.

Ant communities can be huge, with up to 500,000 ants living together. It's fascinating that ants from the same community never fight each other. However, they are hostile towards ants from different communities or species. When introduced to a new nest, ants are attacked. Even after being separated for a long time, ants from the same nest recognize and are friendly towards each other. They seem to have a special way of identifying their nestmates.

The presence of ant and bee communities suggests some form of communication, although the extent remains uncertain. When one bee or ant finds food, others quickly follow. But how they are alerted is crucial. Merely accompanying a discoverer back to the food source doesn't reveal much. To investigate, I conducted experiments. For instance, on a cold day, a lone ant found a fly but couldn't move it. She returned to the nest and emerged with twelve friends to help. This behavior implies she somehow communicated the find. In my tests, ants brought rather than sent their companions. Some ants enslave others, as observed by Huber. They rely on slaves even to feed them. Ants also domesticate other insects, like Aphides, acting as their protectors and even caring for their eggs. Observing their organized and cooperative behavior prompts questions about their level of consciousness and reasoning abilities, suggesting they possess mental capacities akin to humans, albeit to a lesser degree.|"1. What is the main idea of the text passage?

Miss Katy hosted a grand ball where the forest creatures danced all night long, filling the air with music. The Katy-dids, Mosquitoes, Locusts, and a full Cricket orchestra made the forest come alive.

The Crickets found solace in the warmth of the fire, chirping cheerfully to welcome their family members home.

Once upon a time, a tiny jellyfish named Medusa lived in Oconto County, Wisconsin. Shaped like half an apple and the size of a cat's thimble, Medusa floated in the water, eating small things and opening and closing her umbrella, much like jellyfish do in the ocean today. After some time, Medusa laid many tiny eggs among the sea-weeds. One of these eggs hatched Favosites, a wee jellyfish with paddles on his sides that kept him constantly in motion, dodging creatures that wanted to eat him. Eventually, Favosites settled on a flat bit of shell, grew fast, and made a home for himself by catching worms, eggs, and bits of lime to fill his stomach. He even tried to wall himself up inside with bits of lime, a curious habit indeed.|"1. What is the name of the tiny jellyfish that lived in Oconto County, Wisconsin?

"Once upon a time, little Favosites found itself lonely at the bottom of the vast ocean among strange neighbors. One night, while dreaming, a new Favosites sprouted from its side, leading to more and more being born. They grew crowded, shaping into six-sided cells like a honeycomb. Some would leave the group, laying more eggs that hatched into new Favosites. They thrived for a long time, accumulating lime until a flood brought dirt and sand that filled their mouths, causing them all to perish. Over time, they were buried in rock, witnessing the age of fishes, reptiles, and strange creatures. Eventually, a glacier uprooted little Favosites, but it found refuge in the ice, narrowly escaping being ground to powder. As the ice melted, it deposited Favosites and other debris in a swamp, where a curious farmer discovered a piece of ""petrified honeycomb."""|"1.

Not long ago, I strolled by a charming stream flowing through a narrow valley. My aim was to spot any birds around, but I didn't see anything noteworthy. To pass the time, I began looking at rocks; as I walked, I noticed signs of an ancient era when this stream was deeper and home to larger fish. The erosion from the valley's slopes and the shifting of sediments over time filled the old streambed. I stumbled upon an arrowhead while sifting through the soil, sparking my curiosity. This arrowhead led me to discover more relics from the past, remnants of the stone-age children who played with miniatures of their parents' tools. These children engaged in activities like fishing with bow and arrows, which required skill and precision. Their toys, like small axes and stone knives, were crafted with care and served as tools for play and learning.|"1. What was the initial purpose of the speaker's stroll by the stream?

The fishing hooks discovered in Norway were likely used for catching cod-fish in saltwater and perch and pike in lakes. Even broken hooks found were large, indicating a past presence of big fishes in the area. Stone-age fishermen lost these hooks in what is now a small brook, suggesting it was once a larger stream teeming with fish. Fishing wasn't just for children back then; men also captured big game and fish. Boys would have learned to catch valuable fish early on.

The Mist shared a tale with the Night-Violet, describing how it fell from the sky as rain, pleasing the farmer while causing flowers to close and birds to seek shelter. Eventually, the Mist was absorbed by tree roots, serving as nourishment for leaves and flowers. At nightfall, the Mist transformed into a bright airy form, dancing on the meadow. By morning, it turned into dewdrops on petals, ready to journey back to the underground spring. The Mist explained the cycle of its travels, from the brook to the lake, up into the air, and back to the earth. As dawn approached, nature awakened with the Sun rising, frogs bathing, birds chirping, and the stag calling out. The Anemones decided to wait for the Starlings and Swallows, not trusting the early cries of the Plover.|"1. What did the Mist do after falling from the sky?

That evening, Phil visited the Musk Rats, also known as Ondatras. As he approached the creek indicated by the Beaver, he saw creatures resembling big rats with long tails, leaving silver trails as they swam. Some stood motionless on the bank until they dove into the water, reappearing under the water lilies. Phil observed them quietly, comparing them to schoolboys playing games. Intrigued, he moved closer, but the creatures vanished instantly, leaving Phil disappointed. He felt a desire to be a Musk Rat, enjoying their carefree life in the water. Phil discovered the tunnels and chambers where the Musk Rats lived, guided by the Lady Ondatra. She shared their peaceful existence but also the dangers they faced from hunters, especially during the fall.

We ground squirrels are clever creatures, carrying nuts in our cheek pouches, four at a time. Why four? Well, five would be one too many! We're too sensible to hurt ourselves on those sharp points. We neatly bite them off before enjoying them with our fore-paws. Living on the ground keeps us safe from most enemies, but not all. Phil, a curious squirrel, found himself in the middle of a squabble between two chipmunks, Hackee the First and Hackee the Second. Suddenly, they sensed the approach of a stoat, their feared enemy. Phil tried to intervene, but the stoat passed by him. The chipmunks, using their knowledge of the tunnels, outsmarted the stoat and escaped. Phil then encountered an Urson, a porcupine, who explained his bark-eating habits and quill defense. It was an adventurous day in the woodland!|"1.

Aleppo explained the importance of Camels' humps for survival in the desert. He described how the hump stores fat, crucial for sustenance during long journeys.
