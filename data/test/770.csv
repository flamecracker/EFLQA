Dora and Dicky appeared displeased, but I nudged Noel to expedite, and then he expressed his disinterest in playing further. The others seemed eager to argue. I encouraged Noel to act decisively and not be indecisive, and eventually, he pondered between publishing his poetry or seeking a princess to wed. I suggested exploring opportunities to earn money, considering the advertisements promising easy earnings. Dicky, as usual, kept his creations and thoughts hidden until completion. Oswald proposed a treasure hunt as a way to wealth, emphasizing that action is more exciting than mere talk. The narrative aims to focus on the engaging parts, avoiding tedious details, as the essence of stories lies in events unfolding.|"1. What did Noel express disinterest in playing further?

When we decided to search for treasure, we gathered in the cellar and lit the gas. Oswald wanted to dig there, but it had stone flags. After rummaging through old boxes and broken furniture, we found sturdy spades we used at the seaside years ago. We dusted them off, as the girls refused to use cobweb-covered tools. We outlined a square in the garden and began digging. Despite our efforts, we only unearthed worms and stones. We shifted to a softer spot in the flower bed and started a smaller hole. Digging was tough, and we got very hot, but still found nothing. Albert-next-door peered over the wall, unimpressed by our quest. He scoffed at our treasure hunt, not understanding the thrill of adventure. Although we tolerated his lack of imagination, we knew it stemmed from his limited exposure to books.|"1.

We worked hard digging a deep hole to reach a treasure. Oswald suggested making a tunnel, so we took turns digging. Pincher, our dog, helped too. He's good at digging for rats, though he gets dirty. We encouraged Albert-next-door to dig with his hands in the tunnel, but he was scared. Instead, he dug with his feet and caused the ground to collapse on him. He cried, and we feared the police would come. Dicky went for help, and Albert's uncle arrived. He dug Albert out, showing curiosity about the situation.

We pretended to be shipwrecked mariners, enjoying treats we saved from the sinking ship. Alice wanted to solve mysteries like detectives, but we explained the reality of crime. She dreamed of catching coiners with her bloodhound. Oswald and Dicky discussed detective work, using newspapers to piece together clues. Alice, lost in thought, seemed preoccupied. We even checked the paper for real mysteries, but nothing fit. Although Oswald suspected something in the news about burglars and mysterious deaths in Holloway, we decided to let it go. Holloway was too far away.|"1. What did the children use to create a tent in the garden?

We held our breath as it passed beneath the tree where we stood, then tapped gently on the back door and was allowed in. A light flickered in the downstairs room, but the shutters were closed.

Instead of coiners, he saw two young ladies having supper. As he tried to see more, Dicky accidentally caused Oswald to fall among the pots. Alice, quick to act, ran to get help.

The potatoes turned out well once they cut off the burnt parts, but they scolded Oswald for not washing them first, calling him a ""dirty boy."" Oswald suggested trying to rescue someone instead of focusing on their advertisement idea. Noel, lying on the sofa, dreamily mentioned finding a princess or writing poetry. Dicky questioned if Noel had enough poetry for a book, as only seven poems were understandable. They decided to copy the poems on drawing paper to send to a publisher, with Oswald drawing a picture of a ship sinking. They contemplated sending the poems by post but eventually decided to deliver them in person to a newspaper in London."|"6. How did the siblings decide to deliver the poems to a newspaper in London?

When we left, we walked a long way, and a policeman suggested we return through Smithfield. They no longer burn people there, so it was dull and tiring. Noel, a delicate poet, grew weary. We snacked on buns from our shillings and reached Fleet Street late afternoon. The gas and electric lights illuminated the area, including a vibrant Bovril sign. At the Daily Recorder office, we inquired about the Editor. Directed to another office, we found a man in a glass case who instructed us to write our names and purpose. Oswald sealed a letter marked 'Very private' and handed it to the boy. Surprisingly, we were summoned upstairs after the Editor read Noel's poems. Inside, we found a cozy room with a young, tired Editor who kindly reviewed Noel's work.|"1. What did the policeman suggest when the group was walking back through Smithfield?

One day, while pretending to hunt a bear, we discovered a hidden door in the park's wall, leading us to a mysterious adventure in a shrubbery. It was an unexpected and thrilling experience!|"1.

At around eight o'clock, there was a knock at the door. Eliza answered it, and it was poor Jane from the Vicarage. She brought a brown-paper parcel and a letter. Shortly after, Father summoned us to his study. On the table lay the open parcel with our bottle and glass on top, while Father held a letter covered in small black writing. He gestured towards the bottle and asked, 'What have you been up to now?' Father expressed doubt that clergymen could afford such costly wine but expressed interest in tasting it. We shared the remainder with him, deciding to give up our pursuit of earning extra money. The Castilian Amoroso sherry cheered Father up. Oswald realized that consulting with adults often made things seem less appealing. H.O.'s idea of a coconut-shy was abandoned due to lack of resources, and the plan to have Pincher dance with an organ was dropped upon realizing the cost. Despite a wet day and a tough mutton hash dinner, we found joy in imaginative play.|"1. What did Jane bring to the house from the Vicarage?

At around eight o'clock, there was a knock at the door. Eliza answered it, and it was poor Jane from the Vicarage. She brought a brown-paper parcel and a letter. Shortly after, Father summoned us to his study. On the table lay the open parcel with our bottle and glass on top, while Father held a letter covered in small black writing. He gestured towards the bottle and asked, 'What have you been up to now?' Father expressed doubt that clergymen could afford such costly wine but expressed interest in tasting it.

We took out the flags, wooden sword, and drum. Oswald played while the girls washed up until Eliza mentioned having a toothache. The noise bothered her, so Oswald stopped immediately. When you're polite to Oswald, he always listens to your requests. Dicky paused and smoked the peace pipe we used for bubbles in the summer. We put tea leaves in it, but girls weren't allowed to smoke. Oswald said, 'Continue.' Dicky shared his idea about glass bottles being cheap. He proposed selling medicine bottles. The group discussed inventing a cure, debating on what illness to target. Dora suggested a complexion enhancer, but they recalled a soap incident. Noel wanted to create the medicine first. Oswald suggested a wound cure, but Dicky disagreed. They finally settled on choosing the disease before inventing the medicine.|"1. What did Oswald play while the girls washed up?

After Dicky decided to catch a cold for an experiment, the rest of us tried various remedies to cure it. Alice made herb tea with sage, thyme, savory, marjoram, and parsley, which disagreed with Noel. Oswald concocted a mixture of alum, turpentine, sugar, and aniseed, but Eliza threw it away. Dora's gruel helped Noel's chest but couldn't pass as medicine. Dick's lemon-juice and sugar blend was well-liked, while H. O.'s peppermints dissolved in hot water were the favorite. Despite the failed attempts, it was a fun time with Noel's cold, having a fire in his room and the girls reading to him all day. With Father and Albert's uncle away, we had the freedom to try different remedies without interference.|"1. What did Alice use to make herb tea for Noel's cold?

Oswald's cold persisted, troubling his head but not enough to confine him to bed. One day, he accidentally tripped over Alice, who was sitting on the stairs in the dark.

The following day, Albert's uncle took Noel away before Oswald could convince Alice to reveal the sixpence incident. Alice was unhappy, especially at night when guilt weighs heavy. None of us had money except Eliza, who demanded a reason for lending it. Oswald worried about the tainted sixpence and feared the police might come for Alice. Desperation grew as we couldn't find a solution. Oswald encountered Mrs. Leslie and, despite family honor, asked for a loan. Sacrificing pride, he sold flowers for tenpence to clear Alice's name. Oswald's actions, though not noble, saved his sister. Days later, a snowfall led to an unintended mishap with the Water Rates, teaching us a valuable lesson about consequences and responsibility.|"1.

We all deserved the punishment because the others would have shoveled down snow just as we did if they had thought of it. Even wrong things sometimes lead to adventures, as in stories about pirates or highwaymen. Eliza dislikes us being sent to bed early because it means she has to bring meals up and light the fire in Noel's room earlier than usual. But on this particular day, we got Eliza in a good mood by giving her a fake brooch, so she brought extra coal and chestnuts for us. While playing Red Indians in blankets, we heard noises downstairs, like someone moving a chair or poking a fire. Curious, we decided to investigate, thinking it might be a cat that got in. Oswald felt both scared and brave, preferring to face the unknown rather than wait in fear.|"1. Why did the children believe they deserved the punishment mentioned in the text?

Our robber informed my Father about the other burglar and expressed regret for letting him escape. However, my Father was understanding, mentioning that the other burglar might have kids at home.

Father commended my honesty, calling me a brave young individual. We then enjoyed a makeshift feast with bread, cheese, and mutton, sitting informally and relishing the moment.
