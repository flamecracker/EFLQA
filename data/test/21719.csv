That night, the group stumbled upon a peculiar and lively sight. They found themselves at one of Osman Digna's mountain camps, where men were gathering from all directions to join forces with their leader against the Europeans. Camels and other animals were transporting supplies for the large army, and wounded soldiers from recent battles were being cared for.

Despite the difficult conditions, Jack Molloy stood out for his resilience. The Arabs' cruelty towards their captives was evident, especially towards Molloy, who bore heavier burdens than the others. One day, the Arabs intensified their cruelty, particularly targeting Molloy. Despite the heavy load and lashes, Molloy persevered, showing remarkable strength and hope.|"1.
