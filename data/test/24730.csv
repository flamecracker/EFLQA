When the Boone families heard the news, they decided not to move to Kentucky. Instead, they turned back and traveled over the mountains. The Boones were saddened by James' death, but Daniel remained determined to fulfill his dream of settling in Kentucky. He ensured the safety of his wife and children in a secure location, not returning all the way to the Yadkin Valley. Concerned about the increasing number of white men moving west and the Indians protecting their hunting grounds, Daniel and a companion ventured into Kentucky to warn surveyors working there. Most of the surveyors managed to escape unharmed, leading to a temporary peace in Kentucky. Meanwhile, a wealthy man named Richard Henderson planned to purchase Kentucky from the Indians to establish a new colony. Boone, having discussed the idea with the Indians, believed they would agree to sell the land. Henderson arranged a meeting with the Cherokees at Sycamore Shoals in present-day Tennessee. Despite having legal representation, the Cherokees agreed to trade Kentucky to Henderson for a fraction of its actual value. They cautioned Henderson about hostile Indians from the west and north. The construction of the famous Wilderness Road began, which would later be used by settlers with their belongings. Initially, Boone and his team followed Indian trails and buffalo paths, clearing a path through the woods with axes and vigilantly watching for any hostile Indian activity.|"1.

The group of men journeyed until they reached the banks of the Kentucky River, where they started constructing a fort. Daniel Boone was aware that the Shawnees and other tribes did not recognize Henderson's claim to Kentucky. He returned to fetch his family, including his youngest daughter, Jemima.

As they paddled, they were ambushed by five Indians who planned to take them as slaves. Back at the fort, the disappearance was noticed after dark.
