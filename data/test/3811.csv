The staff heard enough through the fogs and mists to know that the Army of the Potomac was awake and stirring. The Southern army also arose, lighted its fires, cooked and ate its food and waited for the enemy.

Harry felt a thrill of admiration that he did not wish to check. After all, the Yankees were their own people, bone of their bone, and their courage must be admired. The Army of the Potomac, too, was learning to fight without able chiefs. The young colonels and majors and captains could lead them, and there they were, after their most terrible defeat, grim and ready.

Burnside, who had crossed the river to join his men, had been persuaded at last that a second attack was bound to end like the first. The next day Burnside sent in a flag of truce, and they buried the dead. The|"1. What did the staff hear through the fogs and mists in the text?

Harry and Dalton perched on a small hill and watched as the two generals conducted a lengthy meeting, occasionally calling upon McLaws, Anderson, Pender, and other commanders. The significance of the night weighed heavily on the two boys. Nature's harshness in the Wilderness set the stage for the impending drama. The darkness transformed the forest into an ancient, primitive world in Harry's mind, filling the air with ominous signals. Even the familiar sounds made him jump, and the fading campfires added to the eerie atmosphere. Harry confided in George about feeling oppressed by the war's uncertainties. Meanwhile, Hooker, facing Lee and Jackson's strategic prowess, grappled with decisions at the Chancellor House.

Lee and Jackson, on the other hand, faced the challenge with clarity and resolve, knowing the South's dire situation required bold action.|"3.
