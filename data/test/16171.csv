Trained horses performing circus feats at the signal of their trainer is not a new concept. Centuries ago, during the reign of a Stuart monarch, a horse named Morocco showcased tricks in England, though they were basic compared to today's standards. Even before the era of Rarey, there were individuals with a unique ability to tame unruly horses. One such instance involved George the Fourth, who owned an Egyptian horse notorious for unseating even the most skilled riders. However, during a visit to England, an Eastern bey and his mamelukes took on the challenge.
