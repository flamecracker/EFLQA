The famous tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, popularized by Browning, is well-known to many. Before Browning's version, the story was recounted in English in various books such as Verstegan's _Restitution of Decayed Intelligence_ and Howell's _Familiar Letters_.

Mrs. Gutch explored a similar legend from Belfast in her study, suggesting a connection to the Pied Piper myth. Mr. Baring-Gould viewed the Pied Piper as a wind myth, while Mrs. Gutch speculated on a factual basis for the legend. The English adaptation of the tale, as presented by Elder, may have been influenced by Verstegan's work. The story's parallels in folklore, such as the magic piper theme, are evident in other English tales like Tom the Piper's son.|"1. What inspired Browning's version of the Pied Piper of Hamelin story?
