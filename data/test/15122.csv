The poodle had a maid to ensure its comfort, while the boys were well-clothed and fed but lacked attention. Their questions were often dismissed, leaving them with no bedtime talks. The Little Colonel's stories captivated them, drawing them closer. Despite fears of bugaboos, they followed her around, eating bananas and listening intently. Their devotion amused and later gratified her. Others praised her for keeping the boys entertained. However, the constant storytelling became tiresome.

In July, they arrived in Switzerland after weeks of travel. They decided to take a break in Geneva, a beautiful old town. The Little Colonel, having breakfast at a hotel, couldn't eat as she was captivated by the view of the lake. Pleasure boats glided on the water, and the quay was bustling with people.

Mrs. Sherman planned to shop for unique music boxes and other musical items. Lloyd suggested surprising Mom Beck with a singing mirror. A kind old French soldier named Major Pierre de Vaux, with a heroic dog named Hero, caught their attention. The waiter mentioned that Hero was very smart and understood everything people said to him.|"1. What captivated the Little Colonel during breakfast at the hotel in Geneva?

Lloyd enjoyed the morning drive by the river, admiring the foreign signs above the shop doors. Passing the quay, they met the Major and his dog.

The coachman, tired from a fête, dozed off. The old horse, once spirited, startled as a board fell, triggering memories of past runaways. In a panic, it bolted down the street, recalling its fear of falling ladders.|"1. What did Lloyd enjoy during the morning drive?

Three years later, I learned from the news about the devastating floods in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys that left thousands homeless. Bertie, who was only six at the time, heard about the children who were crying in the streets because they had no shelter or food. Without saying a word, he climbed up to the mantel and took down his small red savings-bank. Even though we were still living in a cabin and had managed to save a little money from good crops, Bertie poured out all his savings amounting to ninety-three cents. He then added his cherished tin soldiers and his grandmother's knitted mittens to the table.
