Two leaders were selected in every group to oversee the squads. Tim realized that creating more positions would ensure more friends who would support him during challenging times.

Around five in the evening, they came back to the island, and rain started before nightfall. A large fire burned on the island all evening, but the flimsy tents of the Rovers were not enough to shield them from the harsh weather.

"This is a temporary plan, and once we have more boats, we will reorganize. We need skilled rowers for our current tasks. While we are away, Uncle Ben will teach the other boys how to row. The Lily and the Dart had eight oars each, while the Dip only had four and was meant to support the fleet. Uncle Ben assigned positions to the boys, but there were still around thirty boys left after all the oars were taken. After an hour of practice, he trained the crews to work together, and the boats were then used to transport the rest of the group to the boathouse. The others were also taught, and by noon, Uncle Ben had made them quite good at rowing.
