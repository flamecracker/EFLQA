The elephant is a wise animal with a unique way of drinking water. While it may seem like the elephant drinks through its trunk, it actually uses its trunk as a long nose. The elephant dips its trunk into the stream, sucks in water about halfway up, curls the tip near its mouth, and then blows through its nose to squirt the water into its mouth. This process is repeated several times to drink enough water. The elephant cannot drink like other animals by putting its mouth directly into the water because its mouth is high up and its neck is stiff. To avoid muddying the water, the elephant only dips the tip of its trunk into the stream. Baby elephants have their mothers squirt water into their mouths using their trunks. Other animals like buffaloes have their unique ways of drinking water too, often coming together in groups to stay safe from predators like tigers.|"1. What is the main purpose of the elephant's trunk in drinking water?

Now, let's observe the first row of buffaloes drinking. They are all powerful bull buffaloes, the leaders of the herd, distinguished by their enormous horns, each about a yard long on either side of their heads. Notice how they stand closely together, almost touching horns, as they move from their feeding area to the stream. This formation is a strategic defense against prowling tigers, as the horns create an impenetrable barrier. After quenching their thirst, the front row turns to the side in unison, resembling disciplined soldiers. Following this, those who have drunk their fill move to the back of the herd, forming a protective line facing the jungle. Subsequently, the next rows of bull buffaloes take their turn to drink, repeating the pattern of moving to the back after drinking. Additionally, several rows of cow buffaloes and their calves follow suit, with the mothers and young positioned safely in the middle, just like the elephants. An interesting event occurs as a timid blue deer cautiously approaches the water, aware of the lurking tiger. Seeking refuge under the horns of the buffaloes, she makes her way to safety. Remarkably, the buffaloes patiently wait for her to drink, akin to noble knights aiding a damsel in distress. Once the blue deer finishes drinking, she swiftly evades the tiger's pursuit with agile leaps, escaping unscathed.|"1.

As the moon rises, red dogs appear fearlessly. They drink, howl at the moon, and then vanish into the jungle. Their howling might be a form of singing, just like when people sing and dogs join in.

The crimson canines are the final creatures to arrive in a group. Now, you observe other animals arriving solo. A stealthy silhouette emerges! It must be a hyena. This creature scavenges for leftovers from another animal's meal; hence, the hyena waits to see if a tiger or leopard has caught any food, or else it will go hungry. But shh! Here comes a red deer cautiously approaching the water. This animal is larger than the blue deer and more capable of looking after herself. She approaches quietly, glancing around to ensure no tigers lurk nearby. She reaches the water and begins to drink. Notice how her ear is tilted to the side? The red deer listens intently, even while quenching her thirst! Just then, the deer hears a noise! She can detect even the faintest sound. In an instant, while drinking, the red deer swiftly turns and leaps aside. The tiger also pounces at the same moment, aiming where the deer was. However, the deer has already vacated the spot, leaping away from the tiger's grasp. The tiger remains growling in frustration. Knowing the deer can run much faster, the tiger decides not to pursue her, growling for a while before drinking and departing, still grumbling. Before we depart, remember this: the elephants were initially shown to you; they were to our right, downstream where the water flows. The elephants drank first among all the animals.

Salar's father taught him a remarkable trick by a stream at midnight. Salar, a young elephant, was enjoying swimming with the grown-ups when his father decided to surprise him. His father gently pushed Salar underwater, causing him to panic and struggle. But to Salar's amazement, his father lifted his trunk above the water, allowing him to breathe while submerged. This skill made Salar fearless of being submerged as long as his trunk was out of the water. Elephants have cleverly taught themselves this trick, enabling a whole herd to disappear underwater in times of danger. This intelligence showcases elephants as one of the wisest animals, second only to humans. In the jungle, Salar's father also taught him how to break down trees by using his trunk and weight to bend and snap them.|"1. What did Salar's father teach him by the stream at midnight?

The buffalo calf in the herd behaves quite differently from a playful kitten or a puppy dog. Instead of tumbling or chasing its tail, the calf often stands still, staring into space. It may suddenly break into a wild gallop or calmly return to its mother for milk. The buffaloes have a keen sense of smell and hearing to detect danger. They can smell a tiger from a distance of half a mile, equivalent to ten city blocks, and hear the slightest sound from as far as five blocks away. The leader of the herd, a tall and big buffalo, keeps a watchful eye on the surroundings. He pauses to look ahead, to the sides, and even to the back, ensuring the safety of the group before resuming grazing. Another buffalo, on the left, also takes frequent breaks to scan the area and then catches up with the herd before continuing to feed.|"Question 1:

Yes, that is indeed accurate. The Papa buffaloes take turns acting as sentinels. Two sentinels from the ends move towards the middle after some time, and then the next ones take over the watch. They rotate like this daily, ensuring fairness for all. When the Papas rest, they huddle closer together than when they graze, always facing outward in readiness to fend off any tigers. Sentinels are ever vigilant. We must tread cautiously as the terrain shifts, becoming rough with scarce patches of grass. The buffaloes walk a bit without grazing until they find the next feeding spot. They are spreading out now due to the sparse shrubs, creating gaps in their line. These gaps are widening. Observing closely, we see some buffaloes losing sight of each other behind the bushes. The sentinels and leader are alert. If a tiger were to approach suddenly, each sentinel would move towards the direction of the leader's voice, signaling others to follow suit. The buffaloes would then close ranks upon hearing the leader's call. Wait, what's that? The sentinel on the right is fixated on the distant jungle grass. This grass is unusually tall, taller than a person. Why is the sentinel focused on it? What could be causing the grass to sway gently in just one spot? It's not the wind; otherwise, all the grass would move. So, what's causing this peculiar movement in the tall grass?|"1. Why do the Papa buffaloes take turns acting as sentinels?

The two ends of the crescent have come close together, and all the Papa buffaloes have made a perfect ring around the Mammas and the children. The Papas are facing the outside of the ring; so they can meet the danger from whatever side it comes. He was trying to sneak up to the buffaloes; but the sentinel found that out. And now the bull buffaloes are ready for him. The tiger growls in rage. He prowls round and round the ring of bull buffaloes, as you see in the picture. But he dare not try to break through those horns. He roars with fury, shaking the ground; it is just like thunder. The jungle around is taking fright at the roar. See! All the small animals rush out in fright--wild pigs, wild goats, and all sorts of small deer. In their fright they run hither and thither very stupidly. That is exactly why the tiger roars--he wants to make the small animals behave so stupidly, in their fright, that some of them may make a mistake and run straight into his jaws.

When the villagers need to tame wild buffaloes, they employ a clever strategy. First, they secure the struggling animals with ropes. Then, they introduce them to already tamed buffaloes in a pen with a pond. The pen offers fresh water and mud for wallowing. The tamed buffaloes act as mentors, reassuring the wild ones that village life is safer and more comfortable than the jungle. The villagers, especially young boys who are not yet old enough for school or work, play a crucial role in caring for the buffaloes. They learn to communicate with the animals using specific calls for grazing, wallowing, and returning home. Surprisingly, the buffaloes quickly understand and respond to these calls, making it easier for the villagers to manage them during plowing and grazing.|"1.

Now, observe the image on page 109. These creatures are deer. Focus on their antlers. Unlike horns, deer antlers are solid and made of bone. They start as two spikes on the head but branch out into many parts. As opposed to antelopes, male deer shed their antlers annually and grow new ones. This shedding and regrowth process is fascinating. In America, while there may not be dense jungles like in perpetually warm regions, there are forests where wild animals, including deer, thrive. The largest deer species in America is the moose, followed closely by the elk. The elk, almost as large as the moose, depends on trees for survival during winter when it feeds on tree bark. In summer, it grazes on leaves, twigs, and grass.|"1. What are the creatures in the image on page 109?

Deer, like the reindeer, are hardy animals, surviving on very little food in extreme conditions. Reindeer in the frozen North eat only moss or seaweed for days. Another animal, even hardier, can go a week without food or water and work non-stop. Elk have magnificent antlers that grow back every five months. In winter, the antlers fall off gradually, leaving a rough stump on the elk's head. By spring, new antlers sprout and grow rapidly, reaching their full size in five months. While growing, the antlers are soft and covered in protective hairy leather. Once hardened, the elk rubs off the covering on trees. Mule deer in the Rocky Mountains have long ears and can buck like a mule. Fallow deer in Europe have a beautiful coat that changes color with the seasons, making them stunning creatures.|"1.

This allows the camel to go for days without drinking because the cells release water into its stomach gradually. Additionally, the camel's hump serves as a storage unit for excess food, providing energy when food is scarce during long journeys. Furthermore, the camel can sense water from afar, guiding travelers to oases in the desert. These remarkable adaptations make the camel a truly extraordinary desert dweller.|"4. How does the camel's stomach retain water for later use?
A) By releasing water all at once
B) By storing water in its hump
C) By closing the mouths of special cells

The camel is a remarkable animal that can detect an oasis by simply sniffing the air, even when it's too far to see. With its ability to run swiftly, the camel reaches the oasis in an hour, providing a place for rest and nourishment. Camels can consume leaves, figs, dates, and even meat when hungry. They are known for their unique capability to drink saltwater, making them useful in desert regions. In the past, camels were introduced to the western states of America, but without proper management, they became wild. Learning from experts in camel handling could help utilize these animals effectively in desert areas where railroads are scarce. Camels have a distinctive way of walking, lifting the legs on the same side simultaneously. Unlike horses, which lift legs on opposite corners.

Let's talk about the polar bear's unique adaptations. Unlike other bears, the soles of a polar bear's feet are covered in long hair to prevent slipping on icy surfaces. This special feature helps them navigate the slippery ice without any trouble. Additionally, polar bears have smaller heads to easily fit through holes in the ice when catching fish, a task unique to their habitat. Their longer necks give them an advantage in catching fish without falling into the water. In contrast, grizzly bears found in North America, particularly near the Rocky Mountains, are the largest bears globally, reaching up to ten feet tall. While teddy bears are cute toys, real grizzly bears are fierce and known to be aggressive, especially when hunting for food like deer or cattle. This makes them a challenge for cowboys in certain regions.|"1. What is one unique adaptation of a polar bear mentioned in the passage?

Bears are fascinating creatures that exhibit remarkable skills in catching fish. Grizzly bears, like the one in the Columbia River in Oregon, have a knack for capturing trout and shad by patiently waiting along the riverbank for the fish to surface. With lightning-fast reflexes, the grizzly pounces on the unsuspecting fish, rarely missing its target. Another bear species, the brown bear, found in Europe, Asia, and Alaska, also enjoys a diet of fish, particularly salmon. However, the most charming of them all is the black bear, known for its playful nature. This bear's love for honey is legendary, and watching it scoop honey from a comb is reminiscent of a child indulging in jam. Despite the bees' attempts to sting the black bear, its thick fur protects it, allowing it to relish the sweet treat without any harm. The black bear's amusing antics, like mimicking human gestures, make it a delightful sight, whether in the wild or at the zoo.|"1.
