"Cub was on a mission to locate the Thousand Island Crusoe using wireless communication. He contacted three Canadian amateurs for information. The first two shared details about the rescue boat's course and interested wireless boys. The third mentioned a newspaper story. Hal, one of the amateurs, was listening and had vital information about the radio compass users. By triangulating directions from Clayton, Rockport, and Gananoque, Cub pinpointed the island's location on his map. The use of mathematics, specifically geometry, played a crucial role in solving the problem. Cub's father emphasized the importance of mathematics in mechanics.
