The Captain cautioned, ""Let's watch and capture them instead of attacking. We need to find out how they do it first.""

Cyril was assigned the first watch duty, with the Captain taking over at one o'clock. By nine, the family had gone to sleep.

Cyril extinguished the candle and positioned himself by the window. Initially, the darkness obscured his vision, making him fear the warehouse could be robbed unnoticed.

Upon hearing the bell strike ten and then eleven, Cyril suddenly stood up as he heard a scraping noise on the warehouse roof. He rushed to inform John Wilkes about two figures on the warehouse roof, suspecting them to be apprentices sneaking out. A lightning flash briefly revealed a figure on the roof, followed by thunder.

After talking, we agreed that the Moors might not come down for a while, assuming we could endure without food or water until they reached Tunis. We then focused on loosening our ropes. Wriggling didn't work, so we struggled until the cords cut into our skin. It took a while to reach the knife. Eventually, I found the string behind his neck, grabbed it with my teeth, and pulled until the knife reached his throat. John then grabbed it with his teeth, and the hard part was over. Next was simple. John held the knife's handle, Pettigrew the blade, and together they managed to open it. After some effort, Pettigrew got the knife in his hands. I moved back and forth until the blade cut through my wrist's rope, freeing us. We discovered the boarding between us and the main hold was weak. With the knife and our strength, we removed a board. Pettigrew, the smallest, crawled through, and we got another plank down. The hold was partly filled with cargo. We searched quietly for weapons but only found kegs of powder. Without arms, we decided to wait until night to seize the ship. We planned to fill the lazaret with bales and a keg of powder to blow up the cabin above if necessary. We identified the main hatch as our only escape route. Pettigrew suggested using a slow match to blast the cabin overhead while preventing the ship's bottom from blowing out.|"1.

Very carefully, we gathered packages and bales below the hatchway, creating a platform about four feet under it. We planned to stand together, lift the hatchway, and swiftly escape. Pettigrew convinced us to proceed with the plan under both hatches, suggesting the explosions would cause chaos among the crew. After preparing powder kegs with fuses, we waited under the main hatch, ready to ignite them if the crew attempted to open the hatches. We cut the woodwork around the staple to gauge the light above.

"""Let them go, lads. We have punished them heavily enough; we have taken their ship, and sent half of them to Eternity.

Now set to work to get some of the sail off both craft, and then, when we have got things snug, we will splice the main brace and have a meal.""

""We carried the rover into Gibraltar and sold her and her cargo there. It brought in a good round sum, and, except for the death of Pettigrew, we had no cause to regret the corsair having taken us by surprise that night off Pantellaria.""

""That was an exciting business, indeed, Captain Dave,"" Cyril said, when the Captain brought his story to a conclusion. ""If it had not been for your good fortune in finding those kegs of powder, and Pettigrew's idea of using them as he did, you and John might now, if you had been alive, have been working as slaves among the Moors.""

""Yes, lad. And not the least lucky thing was that Pettigrew's knife and Jack Brown's tinder-box had escaped the notice of the Moors. Jack had it in an inside pocket sewn into his shirt so as to keep it dry. It was a lesson to me, and for the rest of the time I was at sea I always carried a knife, with a lanyard round my neck,"|"1.

"""I planned to visit tomorrow morning, sir, but on my way here, I reconsidered. Since you will be present, I think it's best if I don't. I'll return at ten. If you're not back, I'll wait. I'm not sure how I can help and don't want to intrude. Please convey this message to them. If they truly want me to come, I will. I had other concerns, John. Mrs. Harvey was unconscious, and the servant was badly hurt. I focused on them more than the robber. It's risky for two elderly people to be alone in an empty house, especially if neighboring houses are empty too. It's fortunate you came by. Men are accustomed to screams now and often ignore them. Are you feeling alright?""""It's healing slower than expected,"" John replied. ""Constant movement and being around infected areas affect the healing process. Also, wounds don't heal quickly in contaminated air. It's progressing well, though. Once it's fully healed, I should rejoin Prince Rupert. But I'd rather stay to see the end of this dreadful Plague before leaving. This country hasn't seen such a terrible disease since the Black Death.""""Reflecting on our conversation last night, Cyril, I deduced what had occurred. I didn't anticipate it would be this severe.

"""I'm really glad you came along, Sydney,"" Cyril expressed, settling beside his friend near the helmsman. ""I wish the Prince had appointed you as the commander.

The Prince issued orders to an officer nearby. The officer called some sailors and instructed them to bring short lengths of hawser. Meanwhile, others were tasked with rigging tackle to the mainyard.
