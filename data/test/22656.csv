Mr. Morton, the minister who helped Edward before, visited him. Edward shared his story from leaving Waverley-Honour. Although Major Melville still doubted Edward, he softened and invited him to dinner. Later, he tried to help Edward with Mr. Gifted Gilfillan, who led the group taking Edward to Stirling Castle.

Waverley stayed in a small, cramped space for some time, looked after by an elderly woman. He occasionally heard a soft, feminine voice outside but never caught a glimpse of the speaker. Eventually, two Highlanders who had captured him earlier returned and signaled for him to prepare to leave immediately. Edward, weary of his confinement, was relieved and felt well enough to travel.

She silently packed his belongings, slipping the papers among his things unnoticed. Before leaving, she bid him farewell with a smile and nod.
