The making of a movie involves careful planning and creativity. Contrary to what you might think, scenes are not filmed in the order they appear in the final movie. Instead, all scenes set in one location, like a parlor or a battlefield, are filmed together to save time and money. For example, if a movie has scenes in an office and on a ferryboat, both office scenes are filmed together, even if they don't happen consecutively in the story. Later, during editing, the scenes are rearranged to follow the storyline logically. This process allows filmmakers to efficiently capture different scenes and save resources. So, next time you watch a movie, remember that what you see on screen might not have been filmed in the same order as the story unfolds.|"1.

Ruth decided not to go, so the other two girls started their journey. On the porch, they encountered Russ and Paul, who confirmed their suspicion that Mr. Pertell had acquired a large siege gun to demonstrate the impact of explosive shells. The cannon, an old-fashioned siege rifle from the Civil War era, had been stored away after minimal use. Mr. Pertell intended to film a war scene at Oak Farm, where the hill would represent a fortress for the Southern troops. The Union soldiers would attack after the hill was bombarded with shells from the cannon. Real shells with explosive charges would be used, ensuring the safety of the actors playing the Southern soldiers. Russ mentioned that they would film the scene the next day if the weather permitted. Paul explained the precautions taken to protect their ears from the shockwaves caused by the cannon's firing. Sandy Apgar, observing the scene, humorously remarked that the cannon firing was like plowing the hill, suggesting that the filmmakers' activities might benefit the land for future farming.|"1.

The filming day for the scenes with the big gun had arrived. However, due to delays in setting up the earthworks, no pictures could be taken.
