The hunter speculated that St. Luc might not reprimand Tandakora to avoid angering the Ojibways. They decided to scout the woods, finding no threats, and enjoyed a peaceful breakfast by the lake.

The three friends became five as St. Luc and Dubois were warmly welcomed into their group. Dubois, the quieter of the two, seemed to see himself as St. Luc's shadow. The following day, the group witnessed a religious ceremony where confessions were made in the council grove before the Maple Dance. Tododaho, a respected figure, spoke about repentance and the need to do better in the future. Robert noticed similarities between this sermon and those he heard in his Protestant upbringing. The ceremony was moving, especially when Tododaho asked for forgiveness, passing a white wampum belt around for others to confess. The day ended with a grand banquet, athletic games, and the Feather Dance. Despite their differences, Robert and St. Luc found common ground and a growing friendship. Their shared courage, optimism, and chivalry bonded them, with Willet and Tayoga silently approving.|"1. What event did the group witness the day after St. Luc and Dubois joined them?
