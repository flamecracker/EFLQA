Once upon a time, a Cat and a Fox strolled through the countryside, chatting about the weather. Their conversation stirred their hunger, leading them to snatch things they shouldn't have.

When faced with danger, the Cat's single trick saved him, while the Fox's boasting couldn't protect him from a perilous end.
