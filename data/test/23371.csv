"Around midnight on the 28th, a fierce storm raged. Darkness enveloped the land, pierced only by lightning flashes. Thunder barely audible over the howling wind and crashing debris. In a bid for survival, people sought refuge in ditches and hollows. Mr. Ross and his group huddled by a wall near his home. A schooner, once nearby, now hurtled towards them atop a massive wave. ""Hold on!"" Mr. Ross yelled, ducking as the wave crashed over the wall, carrying his house away. Miraculously, the wall held, stopping the schooner just in time. Despite the devastation, the islands' inhabitants survived and thrived after the cyclone seven years ago. As night fell, the storm calmed, allowing them to navigate to the serene lagoon inside the ring of coral.

"The volcanic eruption at Krakatoa was far from what could be called ""moderate."" The cone of Perboewatan showed intense activity, with molten lava, rocks, pumice, and dust being hurled high into the air. The observers saw fiery flashes and heard loud explosions, while smoke and steam billowed forth. The hermit, observing from a safe distance, believed that the energy would likely vent through other cones first. As the explosions continued, fine white dust fell like snow, covering the island's lower parts. Despite the spectacle, Nigel and Moses, a bit unnerved, discussed the possibility of the end of the world. The hermit, Van der Kemp, reassured them that the worst might be over, but Nigel felt it safer to leave the island until the volcano calmed down. Meanwhile, in Batavia, a group of sightseers, including Captain David Roy, planned an excursion to witness the eruption, expecting an unusual and thrilling experience."|"1.

The group arrived at the volcanic eruption site on the morning of the 27th, after witnessing strong explosions and feeling earthquake tremors the night before. Krakatoa and nearby islands were covered in white dust resembling snow. Trees on some islands were stripped of leaves by falling pumice. The steamer approached the active eruption cone, Perboewatan, landing the group nearby. Explosions occurred every few minutes, lighting up the steam-cloud with a fiery glow. The vapor column rose nearly 10,000 feet, with pumice fragments shooting up 600 feet. The merchant shared experiences of pumice blown high into the atmosphere. Captain Roy warned of the challenging terrain and dense forests. Nigel, curious about the expedition, observed the massive crater below, with a deafening roar and steam-cloud spewing pumice and glass fragments.|"1.

Nigel sat back, enjoying the warmth of the sun on his bronzed face, a biscuit in one hand and a drumstick in the other. He watched the tranquil sea, feeling at ease under the equatorial sun. Van der Kemp and Moses shared his contentment. Sea-birds circled the canoe, hoping for scraps of food. Nigel and Van der Kemp happily obliged, feeding the grateful creatures.

Although the professor was initially reluctant due to the rich wildlife and butterflies in the area, he eventually agreed to depart for safety.

The hermit expressed his relief upon learning that the Rakata peak remained calm on the island's southern side where his cave was located. He then set off to check on his canoe, leaving his companions behind. The town of Telok Betong, severely affected by the 1883 eruption, sat at the head of Lampong Bay, opposite Krakatoa. The town was a mix of European residents and a diverse population of natives, Chinese, Arabs, and traders from various islands. Each resident built their house uniquely, creating a charmingly chaotic town. The hermit found his canoe with his loyal monkey, Spinkie, guarding it fiercely. Spinkie showed immense joy upon reuniting with the hermit, displaying affection in a human-like manner.

He mentioned a crackling noise, likely from fragments in the air. As the brig _Sunshine_ neared the island, the commotion grew intense, and warm pumice rained down. Lightning lit up the dark clouds like a pine-tree. Despite the danger, Kathleen found the spectacle splendid. Mud rain fell, followed by white-hot lava fragments. Explosions continued till early morning, with the ancient crater emptied by four grand eruptions. The Krakatoa volcano's vents gone, sea rushed in, causing steam and the final explosions.|"6.

The impact of the rushing water was to cool the upper layer of the boiling lava, forming a thick solid crust at the volcano's mouth. The volcano, akin to a sealed boiler, had nowhere for the expanding gases to escape. The situation was like a bottle with its neck corked by tons of solid rock. Under such conditions, either the cork had to give or the bottle would burst. On that fateful night, both occurred. Throughout the night, the corks popped until Krakatoa finally erupted! The explosions, meticulously noted by geologist Mr. R.D.M. Verbeek, happened at 5:30, 6:44, 10:02, and 10:52 in the morning. The third, around 10, caused the most destruction. Each explosion generated massive sea waves, spreading from Krakatoa to surrounding shores. The eruption also led to a cliff collapse and a dramatic rescue at sea.|"1.

The _Sunshine_ continued its journey amidst destruction and chaos, traveling over land and water until it abruptly halted. There was a scraping sound against the ship's sides, followed by a gradual stop, causing strain on the rigging. Backstays broke, and the foretopsail burst with a loud noise before both masts were lost. Despite the chaos, the water still rushed beneath, and the wind carried unfamiliar scents. In Anjer, a hotel owner went to check his boats' moorings on the morning of August 27, witnessing a massive wave that swept him to safety but sealed the town's fate. The lighthouse-keeper and his family were carried away by a sudden wave, while a Dutch man-of-war was displaced two miles inland. The Krakatoa eruption of 1883 caused widespread destruction, affecting towns, villages, and hamlets, leading to the loss of over 36,000 lives. The explosion's shock traveled around the world, causing extraordinary sunsets and waves that circled the globe multiple times.

"On that day in Batavia, all the gas lights went out, and the pictures shook on the walls as if there was an earthquake, but there wasn't one. It was the air-wave from Krakatoa, and the noise it caused was described as ""deafening."" The effect of these explosions on the Straits Settlements was remarkable. In Java, people thought a ship was in trouble, in Sumatra they believed a fort was under attack, and in Singapore, they thought it was a distressed vessel. The sound even affected telephones, creating a loud roar. The detonations were heard as far as South Australia, 2250 miles away, and even in Rodriguez, almost 3000 miles distant. Ships near Krakatoa did not feel the shock as much due to the proximity. The air-waves traveled in expanding circles worldwide before returning to Krakatoa. Greenwich recorded the air-waves six times, showing they traveled at about the speed of sound waves, which is roughly 600 to 700 miles per hour."|"1.

The global impact of the Krakatoa volcano eruption in 1883 was profound and far-reaching. The eruption triggered massive sea waves that were observed worldwide, coinciding with the eruption dates. These waves were noted in the Java sea and even reached as far as Cape Horn and the English Channel. The unusual sea disturbances were vividly documented, with reports of significant tidal anomalies and dramatic changes in water levels. The aftermath of the eruption led to a cloud of ultra-microscopic dust particles that encircled the globe, affecting the skies and creating stunning visual displays. The dust cloud traveled swiftly, crossing continents and eventually dissipating by the spring of 1884. The skies in the autumn of 1883 were particularly remarkable, with vibrant afterglows and spectacular color displays that captivated observers worldwide.|"1.
