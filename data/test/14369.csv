"Chapter I: The Mystery of the Black Night

Two young men found themselves on a narrow ledge of rock protruding from the water. This stone ledge marked the initial outer wall of a massive breakwater construction project. During high tide, the ledge sat a mere fourteen inches above the Gulf of Mexico's surface, and at the time of their conversation, they were just twenty minutes away from high tide. The top of this stone wall was a narrow thirty inches wide, providing a precarious path for the youths who, on a dark night, were over half a mile from the shore.

On a calm night, with a young man of steady nerves, walking along the top of this breakwater wall wouldn't be too challenging. In the daylight, hundreds of workers and masons could be seen laboring on it, either side by side or on boats and barges nearby."|"1. What is the main setting of the passage?
