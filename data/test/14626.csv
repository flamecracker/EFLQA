The Hindustan, stationed at Chatham and later at the Swim, served as the main ship and training base. To accommodate the increasing number of personnel, around 350 seamen and marines were transferred to the Dominion. Captain Herbert Grant carefully selected Liverpool ferry steamers Iris and Gloucester for their shallow draft, crucial for maneuvering in shallow waters and avoiding obstacles. Vice-Admiral Sir Roger Keyes, Rear Admiral Cecil F. Dampier, and Commodore Algernon Boyle played key roles in planning and preparing the operation. Smoke screening was identified as essential for success, leading Wing Commander Brock to devise an effective system. Admiral Beatty provided additional support by sending a group of officers and men. Navigational aids were established, and forces from Swim and Dover joined to proceed to their designated stations. The operation was meticulously planned with strict communication protocols and prearranged maneuvers. Jack and Frank, along with the crew of the Brigadier, eagerly awaited their role in the daring mission.|"1. What was the reason for transferring around 350 seamen and marines to the Dominion?

Jack had explained that most of the operation needed to happen during the day, which increased the risk of being spotted by enemy planes or submarines. To counter this danger, Admiral Keyes' scouting escort accompanied them. When they reached a favorable position, a prearranged signal was sent to the detached forces to stick to the plan. The group stopped a mile and a half from Commodore Boyle's force to disembark extra teams and launch the coastal motor boats, following previous instructions. The Warwick and Whirlwind, along with the destroyers, advanced to clear the passage from enemy vessels. The Vindictive altered her course towards the Mole, while the Warwick, Phoebe, and North Star circled nearby until the end of the operation. The Warwick strategically placed smoke screens, especially when the wind changed direction, aiding the mission. Monitors and small craft bombarded specific enemy positions to weaken their defenses. The main goal was to divert attention from blocking the canal while capturing key batteries and causing damage on the Mole. Captain Carpenter led the Vindictive, supported by Captain Templeton on the Brigadier and other vessels for rescue and smoke screen deployment. The operation started at 11.40 p.m. on April 22, 1918, with coastal motorboats laying a smoke screen under enemy fire. As they approached the Mole, the enemy noticed them, and the situation intensified.|"1. What was the main purpose of Admiral Keyes' scouting escort during the operation?

Jack had explained that most of the operation needed to happen during the day, which increased the risk of being spotted by enemy planes or submarines. To counter this danger, Admiral Keyes' scouting escort accompanied them. When they reached a favorable position, a prearranged signal was sent to the detached forces to stick to the plan. The group stopped a mile and a half from Commodore Boyle's force to disembark extra teams and launch the coastal motor boats, following previous instructions. The Warwick and Whirlwind, along with the destroyers, advanced to clear the passage from enemy vessels. The Vindictive altered her course towards the Mole, while the Warwick, Phoebe, and North Star circled nearby until the end of the operation. The Warwick strategically placed smoke screens, especially when the wind changed direction, aiding the mission. Monitors and small craft bombarded specific enemy positions to weaken their defenses. The main goal was to divert attention from blocking the canal while capturing key batteries and causing damage on the Mole. Captain Carpenter led the Vindictive, supported by Captain Templeton on the Brigadier and other vessels for rescue and smoke screen deployment. The operation started at 11.40 p.m. on April 22, 1918, with coastal motorboats laying a smoke screen under enemy fire. As they approached the Mole, the enemy noticed them, and the situation intensified.|"4. What was the main goal of the operation described in the passage?

Quickly, following orders, the port 6-inch battery, upper deck pompoms, and the gun in the foretop all fired simultaneously. The Brigadier, under Jack's command, also opened fire. German shells splashed near the Vindictive and Brigadier, but none hit. Jack managed the ship from the flame-thrower hut, while Frank was ready to take over. The port anchor was dropped near the Mole, but the ship rolled due to the tide. Despite broken brows and heavy fire, a storming party led by Lieutenant-Commander Adams landed. More support was needed, and Jack swiftly responded. The storming continued despite heavy gunfire. The Gloucester assisted in securing the Vindictive to the Mole.

The assault on the Mole was meant to be carried out by a storming force to clear the way for a second force to destroy the enemy's guns. The initial landing was off target, causing disarray among the attackers. Commander Adams and Frank led the charge, facing heavy machine-gun fire. After a successful grenade attack, they regrouped but found themselves in a dangerous position between enemy and friendly fire. Frank risked his life to get reinforcements from the Vindictive, dodging bullets along the way. Upon reaching the ship, Frank briefed Lieutenant-Commander Hastings on the situation.

From their fortified positions, the Germans quickly emerged to face the British sailors, machine-guns at the ready. Simultaneously, Frank directed his own machine-guns to fire upon the advancing enemy. The clash of steel and the crack of revolvers filled the air as men fell on both sides. Initially, it seemed the attacking force might be pushed back by sheer numbers, but they rallied and surged forward once more, overwhelming the Germans. The enemy retreated to their fortified position, closely pursued by the British. Commander Adams then split his forces to cover different fronts, with Frank securing the landward side and Commander Hastings attacking the fortified zone.

The troops retreated in an organized manner, ensuring their wounded were taken with them. Moving from the Mole to the parapet using scaling ladders became risky due to enemy fire, destroying several ladders. Men crossed in small groups, taking advantage of the battleships' long-range fire. Rushes were timed between German attacks. Returning to their ships, they re-embarked as they had left, climbing back to the Vindictive's deck and then to their respective ships via small boats. Frank, the Brigadier, assessed his men, noting few casualties; less than a dozen killed and fifteen wounded. He reported to Jack, who remained composed despite the battle's intensity. The successful raid sealed Ostend and Zeebrugge harbors, crippling German submarine operations. The British losses were significant, with the Vindictive and Brigadier sustaining heavy damage. The damaged ships were docked for repairs, and the mission's success dealt a blow to the Germans, hastening the war's end.|"1.
