History reveals that mobs often struggle to maintain resistance against authority. Initially, they may achieve some success, but once those in power recover, they swiftly quell the uprising. It is regrettable not only for the rioters themselves but also for dissenters like me who oppose any form of revolt. Initially, the mob may follow their leaders and show restraint, but they can quickly turn savage, especially when blood is shed. If the rebellion escalates, it can lead to destruction and violence, with heads rolling and chaos reigning. Sir Ralph De Courcy mentioned the dangerous ideas circulating among the rebels, advocating for seizing wealthy goods and estates. These radical notions could incite further unrest and harm. It is essential to avoid such conflicts and seek peaceful resolutions to societal issues.|"1. What is the main concern expressed in the text passage?

This powder could awe a crowd. I painted a Roman statue's head with it, and in darkness, it glowed brightly. It seemed magical, but it's a natural wonder.

There is concerning news about the rioters in Kent, students. Reports have come in stating that they have caused chaos in Rochester by breaking open the jail, freeing prisoners, and causing harm to notaries and lawyers.

The rebels' main motive seems to be to claim land rights by destroying legal documents, creating further chaos and lawlessness.

It seems impossible to gather such a force, especially when considering the unruly citizens of London who will join them. The city rabble will need controlling, in addition to facing the enemy.

While the fortress could hold for months if well defended, it's doubtful it will withstand a siege. The king could easily escape, leaving the place before it's surrounded. Sir Ralph introduces his son, a promising young man keen on pursuing a career in arms, to the king. The king acknowledges the young man's potential and welcomes him at court.

John of Gaunt, the ambitious Duke of Lancaster, is a powerful figure in England. Although some suspect he desires to rule as king, it is believed he aims to govern in the king's name.

""I regret bringing your daughter back so soon,"" he informed Dame Agatha, ""but news came that after the king retreated this morning, rebel leaders incited the people, claiming it was futile to trust promises or seek redress from the king, surrounded by corrupt advisors. The people were urged to take matters into their own hands, leading to a mob shouting, 'Let's go to London! Death to the council! Death to the rich!' They gathered under their leaders and headed for Southwark. Uncertain of the outcome, I thought it best to bring back the young lady."" Dame Agatha replied, ""Thank you; it's better we stay together. My husband suggested moving to the Tower if the rabble march on London."" Richard agreed, ""Indeed, it's wise. The city is divided; some support the rebels for various reasons, creating a complex situation where we are powerless to act against the rebellion. Even those who speak against the mob may secretly support them due to grievances or personal interests.

"""Great job, great job!"" Sir Ralph cheered. ""Another generous gift, fully matching Albert's. This Fleming is truly exceptional. Congratulations, Edgar, from the bottom of my heart. I heard that Sir John Evesham sold his estates, covering the whole hundred of Hoo, a year ago, to live at Court, but the buyer was unknown. Rumors spoke of a castle being built on the heights overlooking the Medway towards Chatham. If you ever become a knight banneret, you'll have land to support your status, riding with knights and men-at-arms. I've ransomed prisoners, but saving a Flemish merchant's life is a unique feat.""
