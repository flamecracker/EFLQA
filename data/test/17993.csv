During the Spanish-American War, the United States Navy swiftly adapted passenger steamships for war service. These ships were crucial for enforcing blockades and carrying out reconnaissance missions. The gunboat Nashville, part of the squadron, intercepted a Spanish merchant vessel, Buena Ventura, marking the beginning of hostilities. The Navy seized numerous Spanish ships, selling most after condemnation by a prize court. The first military engagement occurred near Matanzas, Cuba, where American ships bombarded new Spanish forts. Despite the Spanish firing the first shot, American vessels quickly overpowered the defenses. The Puritan's precise shot, dismounting a Spanish gun, stood out during the skirmish. Tensions rose as news of a formidable Spanish fleet approaching heightened anxieties about potential attacks on American cities. Vigilance and strategic planning were essential as the US Navy monitored the Spanish fleet's movements.|"4. What stood out during the first military engagement near Matanzas, Cuba?

When first arriving in Santiago, the city may appear unkempt and impoverished, with worn-down buildings and signs of decay. However, a climb up the surrounding hills reveals a stunning view of the city with its red-roofed buildings overlooking the shimmering bay. As you approach the harbor entrance, the initial sight is a gap in the hills, but soon you'll spot the picturesque Morro Castle, perched on a rock guarding the channel. This channel, though narrow, eventually leads to the expansive and charming harbor of Santiago, lined with houses along the water's edge. It was from this very harbor that Admiral Cervera and his Spanish fleet set sail on a fateful morning in May. Meanwhile, Commodore Schley, with his squadron including the Brooklyn, Massachusetts, Texas, and Iowa battleships, discovered the Spanish fleet's location after a game of hide-and-seek. Schley's keen leadership and naval experience were instrumental in locating the Spanish ships, establishing a blockade, and notifying Admiral Sampson of the discovery.|"1.

During the Cuban blockade, our ships formed a half-circle outside the harbor, a few miles from its entrance. Big vessels like the New York, Brooklyn, Texas, Iowa, Oregon, Indiana, and Massachusetts were part of the fleet. The Gloucester gained fame among the smaller vessels. Unable to anchor in the deep waters, our ships constantly moved back and forth. Despite being unable to see the Spanish ships in the harbor, our men kept watch over the narrow channel, hills, and forts. To maintain the blockade, our ships used powerful searchlights after the moonlight faded. Four battleships rotated every two hours to illuminate the channel entrance. Blockading is demanding, requiring constant vigilance to prevent enemy ships from leaving or receiving supplies.

When all the cargo was unloaded from the ship, the Florida was getting ready to sail back to the United States. Cuban soldiers lined up along the shore, with women and children standing behind them. A cheerful Cuban marching song filled the air as the Florida departed. The smaller vessels of the fleets, like torpedo-boats and armed tugboats, spent many nights on blockading duty in the Caribbean waters. Strange encounters occurred during these nights, with small craft rolling in the waves or moving in enemy territory without lights. One such encounter involved the tug-boat Leyden halting a large ship by firing warning shots. The British Captain was not pleased by this, but he took it in stride. Lieutenant Fremont, in charge of the torpedo-boat Porter, exemplified the bravery of the navy officers during these challenging times. The most significant event of the war between the United States and Spain took place in the Philippine Islands, discovered by Magellan nearly four centuries ago.|"1.

Have you ever heard of the Filipinos? They are natives of the islands, descendants of Spanish settlers. Besides them, there are native savage tribes still living in many places. The Filipinos attempted to gain independence but were unsuccessful. When they learned of the rebellion in Cuba, they tried again against Spain, sparking a new rebellion. This was the situation when the United States and Spain went to war. The United States, with ships in a Chinese port, instructed Commodore Dewey to focus on the Philippine Islands. Dewey readied his fleet, including the flagship Olympia and five other cruisers: Baltimore, Boston, Raleigh, Concord, Petrel, and the small vessel Hugh McCulloch. They painted the fleet gray to match other U.S. vessels. As they sailed towards Manila, they prepared for battle, discarding wooden items to avoid splinters. Despite the dangers, the fleet advanced towards Manila Bay, where the Spanish awaited, protected by fortresses and big guns.|"1. What is the main focus of the text passage?

Our brave men aboard the launch faced a perilous journey. They narrowly escaped enemy fire from the batteries as they steered towards safety. Eventually, they reached the New York, relieved to find refuge. Once captured, they were treated with kindness on a Spanish warship. Admiral Cervera ensured their well-being and sent word to Admiral Sampson. Despite being transferred to Morro Castle, a less comfortable prison, they remained in good care. Lieutenant Hobson even caught glimpses of our Navy's ships from his cell. Later, they were moved to another prison in Santiago. Meanwhile, other naval actions unfolded. At Cardenas, our vessels bravely engaged Spanish gunboats, resulting in the destruction of the torpedo-boat Winslow and the loss of five crew members. This tragic event contrasted with successful cable-cutting operations at Cienfuegos. Cardenas, once a thriving city, was known for its American residents and sugar plantations. It had a history of pirate activity, which was quelled by US warships long ago.|"1. What did the brave men aboard the launch face during their journey?

Our ships were ready to protect Santiago and attack the forts, but the naval officers knew they needed soldiers on land to help. The ships couldn't enter the harbor until the underwater mines were cleared, but the mines couldn't be removed until the forts were taken. So, it was time for our soldiers to head to Cuba. Thousands of Regulars and Volunteers were waiting in camps in the eastern and southern U.S. to go to Cuba quickly. In mid-June, over 16,000 soldiers, led by General Shafter, set sail from Tampa to Cuba. Loading so many men, horses, food, and supplies onto 34 ships was hard work. The soldiers had a challenging voyage, but they eventually landed at Daiquiri after facing obstacles like crowded ships and bad weather. Once ashore, they had to navigate steep hills, narrow valleys, and rough terrain, working to build roads in the wet and hot conditions.|"1.

During the first day of battle, a memorable event showcased the devastating power of machine guns. From a distance across the valley, a group of Spanish cavalrymen was spotted. The order was given to aim the guns at them. Even though they were far away, requiring binoculars for accuracy, once the guns were fired, the front line of the cavalrymen fell swiftly, prompting the rest to seek cover quickly. Colonel Roosevelt, impressed by the Gatling guns' effectiveness, entrusted a light battery under their command. These Gatling guns were so potent that one of them equaled the firepower of 180 riflemen. A dynamite gun, a new addition to the artillery, caused fear among soldiers, despite its efficiency. Gun No. 2 from Captain Capron's battery was also notably effective, with one shot reportedly taking down sixteen Spaniards at once.|"1.
