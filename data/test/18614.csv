One day, Diamond encountered a little girl struggling against the fierce wind with a troublesome broom. As the wind howled, the girl's rags fluttered, and she seemed terribly lonely. Without a word, North Wind swooped down, nearly getting swept away by the gust. Diamond chased after the girl, trying to help, but her dress tore when he tried to grab her.

They wandered aimlessly until they reached a desolate area. Exhausted, Diamond feared he had led them astray. However, the girl was glad to have his company.

When Diamond woke up, he found himself surrounded by dark hay instead of the lovely figures he expected. The small blue panes in the roof of his loft were glowing in the morning light. Old Diamond, his horse, was waking up in the stable below, shaking himself vigorously. Diamond admired how well his horse could shake off. He quickly got ready and went outside to Mr. Coleman's lawn.

Diamond thought about North Wind's promise to take people to a special land and decided he would ask her to take him there too.
