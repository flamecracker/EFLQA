But I was so provoked when they first grabbed me that I couldn't help it! 

I was interrupted by a visitor - and a scolding at the same time, as he turned out to be a friend, albeit a stranger, Colonel Brentwood, who has been deceived by that deceitful lawyer trying to cause trouble for me. But he'll find out that I'm tough! The Colonel assures me they'll have no trouble clearing my name, so take comfort in that, mother. Your mischievous son, DAVID.

It might have seemed foolish for a reserved man like me, but one's behavior can be quite peculiar at such moments! It marked a grand finale to my rather unconventional courtship. The only worry I have in Babylon is if young Tammy Splint were to find out, it would never end. You see, although he was present, he was unaware of my intentions. Speaking of which, the child has been appointed as a servant by the Colonel, whom they call a tiger. Even more surprising is that the Colonel has also taken in poor Rodgers and made him a servant.

In any case, Rodgers is now in livery and white stockings. This reminds me that they have dressed young Splint in blue tights with brass buttons. He looks quite peculiar!
