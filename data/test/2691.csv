Nan Sherwood was very proud of her friend Rafe, filling her letters to Bess with stories about him. Slow Tom didn't feature much in Nan's thoughts or letters during this time. Her focus was on the handsome Rafe. During the Blackton drive near Pine Camp, Nan met old Toby Vanderwiller. After dinner, Nan, Margaret, and Bob Llewellen watched the Blackton drive by the riverbank. Margaret, unlike her mischievous brother, rarely showed affection. Nan wasn't sure if Margaret liked her. Margaret had thrown away a doll given to her, disliking its painted face. Nan laughed and helped Toby with a wound, despite Margaret's disdain for him. The Llewellen family, from Grandfather down to Baby Bill, had peculiar ways. Nan often saw Margaret, who disliked anyone without a fair face or smooth skin. The Llewellens lived chaotically, despite not being poor. Nan didn't have many opportunities to meet other girls in Pine Camp, except at church services held every other Sunday in the schoolhouse.|"1.

The loud noises of the horses, the howling wind, and the thunder made Nan's ears ring. She could barely hear Tom's cries for help. Finally understanding his directions, Nan pulled with all her might to free Tom. Despite the rain pouring down, Tom managed to grab a pole and head towards the timber cart. The horses were panicking, but their chains held them in place. Tom used a lever to lift the stuck wheel, with Nan joining in to help. Slowly, the wheel began to rise. There was no suction holding it down, just a tree root in the way. Flames burst out again, but with the rain slowing, the wind fanned the fire.

Tom urgently directed his team towards the main road that cut through the tamarack swamp. Pine Camp lay at one end, while the other direction led to the Vanderwillers' knoll and a more frequented road to the forks and the railway.

The wind carried flames towards the dense forest, but the wet sawdust quenched them. Despite this, the fire spread beneath the surface, igniting more dead trees. Tom, with a sense of duty, set off to warn the Vanderwillers of the impending danger, steering his team through the dense forest and over waterlogged roads.
