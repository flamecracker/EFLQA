On a pleasant Sunday at 18, Camden Terrace, Camden Town, the day began with a beautiful breakfast table adorned with flowers that Father brought home on Saturdays. In November, the chrysanthemums added a touch of yellow and copper to the setting. Sausages on toast were a delightful treat for breakfast, a welcome change from the usual eggs. The day continued with a special dinner of fowls and an angel pudding made with rice, milk, oranges, and white icing. After dinner, Father, who had been working hard all week, took care of the Lamb, who had a cough. The family gathered in the drawing-room, but their peace was interrupted by the cook, who wanted to leave. The reason? The children had dirtied the new carpet with mud from a foreign tower. Despite their explanations, the children faced consequences, including losing the carpet for a week. The day that started beautifully ended with gloom, even as they tried to lighten the mood with supper.|"1. What did the family enjoy for breakfast on that Sunday?

The kids sneaked to the pantry window, next to the house with a green gate labeled 'Tradesmen's Entrance', always locked. They managed to climb over by stepping on the fence and gate handle. Once inside, they lit all the gas-jets in fear of burglars. The children explored the empty house with the Phoenix, a magical bird, and even made friends with the blackbeetles in the cupboards. Anthea then showed how to light a fire from scratch, starting with cleaning out the old ashes, placing cinders, newspaper balls, wood sticks, and coal in the grate. Despite some minor mishaps like a bleeding knuckle and a cut finger, the fire was successfully lit, and Anthea washed up after. Remember, this method works well in London, but lighting fires in the countryside is done differently and more beautifully.|"1. What did the kids do to enter the house?
