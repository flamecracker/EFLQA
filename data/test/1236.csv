The argument was escalating until a man, recognized as an officer responsible for maintaining peace among the tribes, intervened. He swiftly disciplined the women to restore order. These officers are appointed by the chief to oversee the village's security for a few days. They act as constables or sentinels, ensuring peace during the day and guarding the camp at night. Their authority is unquestionable, and even chiefs cannot defy them. When the explorers prepared to depart, the Native Americans hesitated to let them go. Captain Lewis diffused a tense situation by offering tobacco and challenging the chief to demonstrate his influence by persuading his warriors to release the boat's rope. This tactic successfully averted conflict, allowing the explorers to sail away smoothly.|"6. How did the tactic used by Captain Lewis help the explorers sail away smoothly?
A) By starting a conflict
B) By ignoring the villagers
C) By offering gifts and a challenge
D) By threatening the chief
E) By leaving without permission"|C) By offering gifts and a challenge|
The Rickarees were very curious about the white men. They were especially fascinated by Captain Clark's servant, York, a strong black man. York entertained the Rickarees by claiming he was once a wild animal tamed by his master, showing off his strength. The white men wanted to gather the entire nation, so they invited the chiefs from upper villages for a meeting. They exchanged gifts and demonstrated an air-gun, surprising the Rickarees. The Rickarees impressed the white men by refusing whiskey, stating it would make them foolish. The two groups exchanged presents, including a unique bean collected by mice that the Rickarees cooked and ate. The Rickarees and white chiefs had a grand meeting and agreed to maintain peace. The explorers found Stone-Idol Creek, now known as Spring River, named after two stone figures on its banks. The creek was named after the stones, surrounded by a legend about a man and woman turned to stone while holding grapes. The Rickarees make offerings to these stones. At their last camp in South Dakota, a soldier was lashed for mutiny, which deeply affected the Rickaree chief. The party later reached Cannonball River, where they encountered abundant wildlife like buffalo, antelope, and elk.|"1. What fascinated the Rickarees about Captain Clark's servant, York?

The cliffs by the river are home to the calumet bird, also known as the golden eagle. These birds return to the same nests yearly, perched high above, requiring hunters to be lowered down by ropes to reach them. The bird's tail feathers, twelve in total and a foot long, are highly valued by the Indians, with tales of trading a good horse for just two feathers. The explorers encountered elk, deer, antelope, and buffalo, trailed by wolves waiting to prey on the weak or deceased. They reached Heart River, known as Chisshetaw by the Indians, where the Northern Pacific Railway now spans the Missouri River. Winter was approaching, prompting discussions with neighboring tribes like the Mandans, Annahaways, and Minnetarees, where gifts were exchanged, and councils held to decide on winter camp locations.|"1.

Two visitors from the lower village, the Big White and the Chayenne, known as the Big Man, arrived after a hunting trip. They missed the council the day before, so the explorers repeated part of their speech and honored the chief with a medal. Captain Clark scouted a winter camp location upriver but decided to settle lower due to a lack of wood and game. They built Fort Mandan on the north bank of the Missouri River, where they were visited by local Indians. The expedition employed an interpreter, Chaboneau, and his wife, Sacajawea, who proved invaluable. Despite language barriers, interpreters used gestures to communicate. The explorers also discovered a new species of ermine. They navigated tensions between warring tribes, particularly the Sioux and Mandans. The Mandans declined Captain Clark's offer to help retaliate against the Sioux due to deep snow. This incident, however, helped build rapport with the tribes and deter further conflict.|"1.

The journey of Lewis and Clark, which began on April 8, 1805, was a bold venture into the unknown wilderness of the American continent. Leaving behind their comrades to return to the United States, the explorers embarked on a voyage of discovery through uncharted lands.

The situation grew dire as two hunters were cornered at a riverbank, forcing them to jump into the water. Just as the bear closed in on them, a shot from a hunter on shore finally took it down. The hunters managed to save themselves and salvaged the bear's skin. Meanwhile, a separate incident involving a canoe mishap almost led to a catastrophic loss of essential supplies. Due to a steering error during a sudden wind gust, the canoe capsized but was eventually saved, narrowly avoiding disaster.|"2. How did the hunters try to defend themselves against the bear?

The Musselshell River, believed to rise near the Yellowstone, actually originates in the Little Belt Mountains. The river was once named after Sacajawea, but is now known as Crooked Creek. As the explorers journeyed, the weather grew colder, with ice forming along the river's edges. Despite the chill, mosquitoes remained a nuisance. Vegetation suffered from frost, notably the cottonwood trees losing their leaves. The highlands boasted clear air, making objects appear closer than they were. The explorers faced challenging terrain with poor soil and scarce game. The region featured shrubs like wild sage and greasewood, crucial for early travelers as fuel. The landscape was rocky with sandstone and granite formations, offering little timber. Wildlife sightings were sparse, with buffalo becoming scarce and bighorned animals spotted among the cliffs.|"1.

The bighorned animals, once called “Rocky Mountain sheep,” are now known as bighorns. Captain Lewis first sighted the Rocky Mountains from Cow Creek, Mont., marking a significant moment of their journey. As they navigated the Missouri River, they encountered rapids and observed elk, bighorn, and jack-rabbits. The river's width averaged 200 yards, with frequent shoals and rocky points. The landscape was rugged, with high bluffs and various rock formations. Transitioning to a more hospitable region near Birch Creek, the party found a lush environment with cottonwood-covered islands and fertile low grounds. They were relieved to leave behind the harsh terrain and encounter more favorable vegetation.

Navigating through the waters, Lewis and Clark encountered Judith's River, a beautiful waterway that originates in the Rocky Mountains and teems with wildlife like bighorn sheep and beavers. Moving on, they reached Slaughter River, now called the Arrow, where they witnessed a chilling sight of buffalo carcasses strewn below a precipice, evidence of a hunting technique that led the animals to their demise. Despite the dry and pure air, the explorers found no Indians but came across abandoned camps, indicating recent human activity. The landscape around them was awe-inspiring, with cliffs rising dramatically from the water, sculpted by the elements into fantastical shapes resembling ancient ruins.

"In a stunning landscape, there are immense walls rising vertically from the river, reaching heights of up to one hundred feet and varying in thickness from one to twelve feet. The walls are made of durable black stones composed of earth, sand, and talk or quartz, neatly arranged like bricks.

Both groups returned without any conclusive information about the true Missouri River. The next day, Captains Lewis and Clark led separate parties to explore further. Captain Lewis noticed the river was veering too far north for their intended route to the Pacific. As they tried to return, the weather worsened, making the journey back challenging. On June 7th, a dangerous incident occurred when Captain Lewis and Windsor almost fell off a bluff. They had to carefully navigate their way back, cutting footholds in the banks to cross the river. The Lewis party rejoined the main group on June 8th, reporting that the river lacked timber except in lowlands with beautiful groves. They named the river Maria's River but later realized the southern stream was the true Missouri. Lewis and Clark concluded that the northern stream was a significant branch of the Missouri River.|"1.

Both groups returned without any conclusive information about the true Missouri River. The next day, Captains Lewis and Clark led separate parties to explore further. Captain Lewis noticed the river was veering too far north for their intended route to the Pacific. As they tried to return, the weather worsened, making the journey back challenging. On June 7th, a dangerous incident occurred when Captain Lewis and Windsor almost fell off a bluff. They had to carefully navigate their way back, cutting footholds in the banks to cross the river. The Lewis party rejoined the main group on June 8th, reporting that the river lacked timber except in lowlands with beautiful groves. They named the river Maria's River but later realized the southern stream was the true Missouri. Lewis and Clark concluded that the northern stream was a significant branch of the Missouri River.|"6. What conclusion did Lewis and Clark reach about the northern stream of the Missouri River?
A) It was not significant
B) It was the main branch
C) It led to the Pacific
D) It had dangerous rapids
E) It was impassable"|B) It was the main branch|
We shared our observations with the group, but everyone disagreed. They relied heavily on Crusatte, a seasoned waterman, who believed the north fork was the true Missouri. Concerns arose that the south fork might lead us astray towards the Rocky Mountains, far from the Columbia River. To prevent mistakes, it was decided that one of us should explore the southern branch by land. To lighten our load, we stored a pirogue and excess supplies in a cache. These caches, common among traders, keep goods safe for years. Our cache was carefully constructed to conceal the items. Captain Lewis led a small party to scout the south branch, encountering wildlife and breathtaking views of the snow-covered Rocky Mountains.|"1. What was the main reason for the group's disagreement?

Captain Lewis continued his journey along the river, encountering a series of rapids and small waterfalls that gradually decreased in height as he progressed southwest. After traveling about two and a half miles, he reached a cataract measuring twenty-six feet in height. The river widened to six hundred yards at this point, and the water cascaded down in a smooth sheet over a rock protruding from the riverbed, creating a beautiful sight. Nearby, there was a plain on the south side and a hilly area on the north side, with a small island in the middle of the river covered in trees. While observing the surroundings, Captain Lewis noticed an eagle's nest on a cottonwood tree on the island. As he continued his exploration, he encountered a cascade and a herd of buffalo, where he narrowly escaped a bear attack by plunging into the river. Later, he encountered an animal resembling a wolf or wolverine before rejoining his party for the night.|"1.

The next morning, Captain Lewis awoke to find a rattlesnake near his sleeping spot. He killed it and noticed it was different from those on the Atlantic coast, not in color but in pattern. Captain Clark was below, waiting for the others to rejoin him. He began searching for a way to carry the canoes across to the Columbia River. The men hunted and worked on making wheels. The explorers faced challenges as they tried to find a suitable portage for the canoes. They named a creek Portage Creek, where they planned their operations. They encountered buffalo herds near the falls, providing food for predators. The explorers made progress in preparing for the journey ahead, including drying goods and building wagons. Captain Clark surveyed the area and marked out an eighteen-mile portage route. The accurate survey he made is still recognized for its precision today.|"1.

On the twenty-first of the month, after completing all necessary preparations, the challenging task of making the portage began. All members of the expedition were now united, and the two captains shared the duties of hunting, carrying loads, building boats, exploring, and more with their teams. They established three camps – one by Portage Creek, the next at Willow Run, and the third across from White Bear Islands. The portage work lasted until July second. Progress was often hindered by the breakdown of their simple carts, and in the final stretch, much of their gear had to be carried on the men's backs. The men also faced difficulties with prickly pear cactus spines that pierced their moccasins and caused painful foot injuries. Despite the challenges, the team persevered with determination and resilience.|"1. What was the main task that the expedition members embarked on starting from the twenty-first of the month?

On this day, Captain Lewis, part of another group of the expedition, observed that those who were able to dance enjoyed themselves on the green to the music of Cruzatte's violin. At White Bear camp, they were busy preparing a boat made of skins, using a frame from Harper's Ferry in Virginia. The boat was iron-made, thirty-six feet long, four and a half feet wide, and twenty-six inches at the bottom. They faced challenges finding straight timber for it, resorting to willow and box-elder due to the softness of cottonwood. The main party joined Captain Clark at the lower camp, where they also hid the boat-swivel. The group faced nightly disturbances from grizzlies, requiring them to keep their guns close. Captain Clark narrowly escaped a sudden rainstorm at Whitebear Islands with his party, ensuring everyone's safety from a sudden flood that could have swept them into the river.|"1.

On this day, Captain Lewis, part of another group of the expedition, observed that those who were able to dance enjoyed themselves on the green to the music of Cruzatte's violin. At White Bear camp, they were busy preparing a boat made of skins, using a frame from Harper's Ferry in Virginia. The boat was iron-made, thirty-six feet long, four and a half feet wide, and twenty-six inches at the bottom. They faced challenges finding straight timber for it, resorting to willow and box-elder due to the softness of cottonwood. The main party joined Captain Clark at the lower camp, where they also hid the boat-swivel. The group faced nightly disturbances from grizzlies, requiring them to keep their guns close.

In the western regions, sudden and intense storms known as cloud-bursts have posed dangers to travelers. Early emigrants heading to California faced perilous situations due to these downpours. There are accounts of entire groups with wagons and animals being swept away in narrow mountain canyons by floods caused by these storms. Captain Clark, after encountering a severe hailstorm, decided to return to camp due to the adverse weather conditions. The hail was so large and driven by strong winds that it caused injuries among the group members. Despite the challenges, the expedition continued its work on the boat, with progress being made on the woodwork and the preparation of skins for covering the boat. Additionally, the team encountered various wildlife in the area, including buffalo and beavers, while observing the behavior of different bird species in the region.|"1.

Dr. Coues explains that the writing was done at a time when people believed bats were birds and whales were fishes. The journal confuses bats with birds like goatsuckers. A rain shower fell early, and the group gathered baggage left behind. They spent three hours assembling a boat and sewing leather on it. By two o’clock, the last baggage arrived, and they were eager to continue. Mosquitoes were bothersome. The group went to a large island to confront bears that had been causing trouble. They found the bear in a thicket and shot it. They encountered a unique rat, now known as a pack-rat. The explorers were near the Rocky Mountains. They faced troublesome winds and heard mysterious noises from the mountains. The watermen believed the noise came from bursting silver mines.|"1.

"Many strange noises in the mountains have puzzled explorers, but one explanation suggests that geodes, hollow stones with colorful crystals inside, may be the source. A day's menu for the explorers included bacon, beans, suet dumplings, and buffalo meat, which Captain Lewis found less sumptuous than typical feasts. Despite their efforts to build a boat named the ""Experiment,"" covered with buffalo and elk skins, it proved disappointing. The boat leaked due to the skins separating from the seams, forcing them to abandon it. Captain Clark set out to find suitable trees for canoes, facing challenges in finding appropriate timber.

On the thirteenth of July, Captain Lewis followed Captain Clark up the river. He crossed the stream to the north bank with six canoes and all his baggage, catching up with the other party on the same day. They were all busy building boats. Along the way, he passed a huge Indian lodge, possibly a council-house, unlike any they had seen before. The lodge was circular, 216 feet in circumference, made of 16 large cottonwood poles about 50 feet long. These poles were evenly spaced and converged toward the center, secured by willow-brush withes. There was no covering, and in the center was a large fire pit, surrounded by marks of about 80 leathern lodges. Captain Lewis also spotted turtle-doves and pigeons, shooting one that resembled the wild pigeon of the United States. The explorers were diligent in hunting buffalo for food, as they needed to supply 32 people with meat daily. They encountered mosquitoes and gnats, using nets to protect themselves. They discovered new plants and embarked on their journey early in the morning, loading the heavily-laden canoes and setting out at ten o'clock. They reached Smith's River, named in honor of the Secretary of the Navy, and observed buffalo herds in the valley. The prickly pear and sunflowers were in bloom, along with other common plants. The Missouri River had become very crooked, making navigation challenging. Despite the obstacles, they continued their journey,|"1. What did Captain Lewis do on the thirteenth of July?

The journey ahead was challenging. The river was wide but slow-moving, flanked by narrow lowlands with sparse aspen trees. Steep cliffs loomed over us, forcing us to navigate back and forth across the river. Dark granite walls rose high, carved by the river's passage over time. Pine dotted the mountainsides, while sunflowers bloomed abundantly in the grassy bottoms. The Native Americans relied on sunflower seeds for bread and soup thickening. They also enjoyed wild berries like currants and service-berries, which were more flavorful than those back home. We glimpsed agile big-horned animals on the cliffs, their sure-footedness a marvel. As we continued, we reached a clear, broad river from the north, named Dearborn's River in honor of the Secretary of War. The transparent water hinted at navigability, but the rugged terrain ahead remained a mystery.|"1. What type of terrain did the travelers encounter on their journey?

The explorers encountered a challenging river with frequent shoals and ripples, forcing them to drag their canoes over stones due to shallow water. The current made it necessary to use a cord to navigate the boats. Walking on shore was hindered by brushwood, so they waded through the river, causing tender feet and slippery falls. Despite these obstacles, the hunters managed to catch deer, geese, ducks, antelopes, cranes, beavers, and otters for food. When they reached the forks, a mishap occurred when a beaver carried off a note attached to a pole, leaving them unsure of the river's branches. Opting for the northwest fork, they encountered rapid waters and had to cut through willow-brush to proceed. The expedition faced challenges, including overturned canoes and lost supplies, but managed to dry and salvage most items.|"1. What did the explorers encounter while navigating the river?

Convinced of the necessity to obtain horses to cross the mountains, it was decided that one of the group would venture to the head of the river in the morning to seek the Shoshonees or another tribe for assistance in transporting their baggage, much of which they might have to abandon without horses. Early the next day, Captain Lewis, accompanied by Drewyer, Shields, and M'Neal, embarked on this mission with the goal of encountering a native tribe before reuniting with their companions, regardless of how long they might be separated from the main party. Meanwhile, the rest of the group continued up the river in canoes, facing challenges due to the river's winding course, which only allowed them to cover four miles in a direct line over an eleven-mile stretch. The group on foot led those with the canoes, exploring the various stream forks that posed difficulties due to their twists and turns. On August 11, 1805, Captain Lewis sighted the first Indian since leaving the Minnetarees territory, deep in the Missouri. The journal entry for that day describes the encounter with the Indian, believed to be a Shoshonee, and the efforts made to establish friendly communication despite the initial mistrust displayed by the native.

"This place, where the deceased are laid to rest, is a structure about sixty feet long and twelve feet wide. It is made by erecting poles or forks six feet high in the ground, with a long pole extended across the top. Broad boards and pieces of canoes are leaned against this pole to create a slanted roof, leaving both ends open. Inside, bodies wrapped in leather robes are carefully arranged in rows on boards, covered with mats. Further in, half-decayed bones are scattered, and a large pile of bones is stacked in the center. At the eastern end, twenty-one skulls are placed in a circle on a mat. The method of burial involves wrapping the body in robes, then adding the bones to the pile, and finally arranging the skulls together. The structure also contains fishing nets, baskets, wooden bowls, robes, skins, and trinkets as offerings.

Upon our initial arrival, the locals displayed surprise but not alarm. We quickly bonded through smoking and music, as the Indians enjoyed the violin. They shared fruits and root-bread, and we purchased three dogs from them. Their homes resembled those of the Indians upstream, and they spoke the same language. Their attire, made of wolf, deer, elk, and wildcat skins, was similar, with hair in plaits down their shoulders and animal tails hanging over their chests. They valued otter-skins greatly. We encountered a mountain sheep's skin, covered in white hair, resembling a goat's bristles. Behind the village lay a pond with many small swans. The Indians living near were known for their bravery, as one risked his life to retrieve a goose from the river, swimming back just in time to avoid certain death. The expedition navigated challenging rapids, passing through a narrow channel crowded with islands and rocks. The local Indians were friendly but demanded high prices for their goods, as they valued beads above all else for trade.|"1. What did the locals value greatly according to the passage?

When we landed for dinner, a group of Native Americans from the nearby village came to visit us, dressed in colorful attire with scarlet and blue blankets, sailors' jackets, and trousers. They carried weapons like war-axes, spears, bows and arrows, or muskets and pistols. Despite our efforts to be friendly, they behaved arrogantly and stole a pipe and a coat. We searched and found the coat but not the pipe. Up ahead, we encountered two canoes with twelve Skilloot men, one adorned with a bear and man figures. We named the island Image-canoe and saw Mt. St. Helen's, also known as Mt. Ranier, a 9,750-foot peak in Washington. The Skilloots spoke a different language, dressed similarly to Echeloots, and had flattened heads. They excelled at hunting deer and lived off fish, roots, and some elk. Our camp near a noisy sand island made sleeping impossible due to the loud geese and ducks. The next morning, we continued our journey down the river, passing a compact Indian village and encountering the Wahkiacum tribe, known for their unique clothing and houses. Their language and appearance differed from the tribes above, and they traded for wappatoo roots. Their houses were raised above ground with beds, fireplaces, and drying fish.

The sea was too rough to continue by water, so the explorers set up camp on land. They were visited by Wahkiacums who brought wappatoo-roots for food. Captain Lewis and his team explored the bay and found plenty of game like ducks, geese, and venison. The weather turned bad with heavy rain and strong winds. The explorers subsisted on wappatoo-roots, which were like Irish potatoes. Clatsops arrived with sea-otter skins, but their prices were high. The explorers tried to barter with watches, beads, and dollars. They hoped for trading ships but none arrived. They prepared for winter, hoping for relief that never came. The rain was relentless, making life miserable for the campers. Captain Clark described the situation as dreadful and uncomfortable due to the constant rain and harsh winds.|"1.

Captain Clark, while with the Indians, was startled by a sudden cry from a nearby village around ten o’clock. The Indians swiftly rose to investigate as they were informed that someone had been killed. Upon inspection, a man named M’Neal was missing, prompting Sergeant Pryor and four men to search for him. M’Neal had been lured by a stranger to a tent where a Chinnook woman, an old acquaintance, was waiting. The woman sensed the stranger's ill intentions and alerted the village by shrieking, causing the stranger to flee. Meanwhile, the party faced scarcity of meat and decided to preserve it in smaller portions. Drewyer, a skilled hunter, managed to secure seven elk, ensuring the group's sustenance. Despite challenges, the men's proficiency with rifles guaranteed a steady food supply.

The Columbia River Indians were known for their exceptional craftsmanship, particularly in creating intricate baskets and canoes. The baskets were meticulously woven from cedar-bark and bear-grass, forming water-tight containers of various sizes. Some were adorned with colorful patterns made from bear-grass strands, showcasing the artisans' skill and attention to detail. The canoes, essential for transportation, were expertly crafted from white cedar, often reaching impressive lengths of over fifty feet. These canoes could carry heavy loads and were embellished with elaborate carvings at the bow and stern. Despite limited tools, like chisels made from old files, the indigenous people demonstrated remarkable patience and dedication in their work. Canoes held great value and were even exchanged for marriage arrangements, highlighting their significance in tribal culture.

Fort Clatsop, where the explorers spent the winter, was given to Chief Comowool of the Clatsop tribe. The chief likely knew the fort would be abandoned in the spring. The group left Fort Clatsop at 1 p.m. and traveled 16 miles before camping for the night. The next day, they reached an Indian village where they bought supplies for the sick men. The explorers then encountered the Skilloots, who had been at odds with the Chinooks. The two tribes traded through intermediaries. The explorers spent time on Elalah Island, also known as Deer Island, where they hunted and observed wildlife. They encountered a California condor, a rare bird of prey. At Quicksand (Sandy River), they learned of food shortages up the Columbia River. The group planned to collect enough meat to sustain them until they reached the Chopunnish nation. They intended to trade for canoes and horses to continue their journey. Starving Indians confirmed the scarcity of food in the region.|"1. What did the explorers do at Elalah Island?

Later that day, the group arrived at a massive Chopunnish dwelling, measuring 156 feet in length and 15 feet in width. Inside, thirty families resided, each with their own fire burning on the earthen floor. Hungry and tired, the group could only find a small amount of cow roots and bread to eat. The locals sought medical help, offering dogs or horses in exchange. Captain Clark treated a woman's abscess in exchange for a horse. The group distributed medicine and received some dogs in return. They set out the next day with a guide to find Chief Twisted-hair, leaving behind their horses. Struggling to find food, they relied on a horse traded for medicine.

Game was abundant, and since their goal was to gather meat for the three non-hunting men who would remain at the falls, they decided to head towards the Medicine, or Sun, River to hunt along its banks. The journal entry for July 10 describes the area as having an abundance of blooming prickly-pear and ripe red gooseberries, although there were no currants. The river had widened to about one hundred yards, with deep waters filled with islands and rapids in certain areas. After traveling seventeen miles, the timber vanished entirely from the river bottoms. The group encountered elk and a brown bear, which they hunted.

Captain Lewis, exploring northwest, found signs of buffalo and feared nearby Indians. Amid vast herds, they encountered the North Fork of Maria's River. Bad weather and a broken chronometer forced a return, naming their camp Cape Disappointment. While journeying down Maria's River, they encountered a group of Indians. Captain Lewis cautiously approached, displaying a flag in a friendly gesture. The Indians, initially alarmed, eventually approached, and a dialogue ensued.|"1.

On the twelfth of August, the Lewis party met two traders from Illinois camping on the northeast side of the river. They had been hunting and trapping along the Missouri. Captain Lewis learned that Captain Clark was below, and later that day, the entire expedition was reunited near Little Knife Creek. Now we turn to Captain Clark's narrative and his adventures on the Yellowstone River. His route was more challenging than Lewis's, with a larger party traveling up Clark's River to Ross's Hole, crossing the continental divide at the pass he discovered. They then followed the Wisdom River, known today as Big Hole River, to Shoshonee Cove, Two Forks of the Jefferson, and down to the Three Forks of the Missouri. They celebrated Independence Day with a simple meal and continued their journey through challenging terrain.|"1. What did the Lewis party encounter on the twelfth of August near the river?

The explorers finished constructing two canoes at noon, preparing to set out the next day. Sergeant Pryor and his companions were tasked with taking the remaining horses to the Mandans and potentially delivering a letter to Mr. Henry on the Assiniboin River. While exploring an Indian lodge on a large island near Canyon Creek, they found it designed for councils. The lodge was cone-shaped, adorned with eagles' feathers and buffalo trophies. As they journeyed down the river, they marveled at the picturesque scenery, with cliffs, hills, plains, and diverse wildlife like buffalo, elk, and wolves. Reaching the Bighorn, a tributary of the Yellowstone, they bid farewell to the Rocky Mountains and continued their voyage. They encountered various terrains, wildlife, and named natural features based on encounters, like Buffalo Shoal and Bear Rapid. The buffalo's abundance caused concern as they roamed near the camp, posing a risk to the boats.|"1. What were Sergeant Pryor and his companions tasked with?

The group had a challenging encounter with wildlife during their journey. They navigated a wide river with sandbars and islands, encountering bighorn sheep, buffalo, wolves, and fierce bears. Despite the abundance of elk and deer, the party struggled to find food due to the difficulty of preserving elk meat. The expedition faced swarms of mosquitoes, making camp unbearable. Captain Clark decided to move to a mosquito-free area with more game, leaving a note for Captain Lewis at the river junction. The mosquitoes persisted, forcing the group to endure sleepless nights and relentless bites. Captain Clark's hunting efforts were hindered by the insects until a northwest breeze provided some relief. The group camped under a bluff, escaping the mosquitoes briefly until a storm hit.

After some time, Captain Clark gave a small medal to the Chayenne chief, explaining its significance. The chief was initially alarmed, believing all white people's gifts to be 'medicine.' He sent for a robe and buffalo meat to exchange for the medal. Captain Clark clarified that the medal symbolized the trust his great father had in chiefs who followed his advice. The chief, now reassured, accepted the medal and offered more buffalo meat in return. The Mandan chief, Big White, also expressed peaceful intentions. Despite initial tensions, harmony prevailed among the tribes. The Ricaras hesitated to join the voyage until their chief returned, and the Chayennes were wary. The Mandan chief welcomed Captain Clark, offering tobacco, beaver-skins, and food. Continuing their journey, they reached Tyler’s River, now Medicine River.

After a long absence, the explorers were thrilled to meet Mr. Airs, a kind man who generously provided them with tobacco and flour for their journey.
