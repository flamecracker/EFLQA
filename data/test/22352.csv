The weather was scorching hot, and some were already suffering from fever or its symptoms. Thankfully, bathing was refreshing, and many went in once or twice a day. Bathing in the ocean was a thrilling experience for some plainsmen who had never seen anything larger than a river or creek. They played around like children, organizing races with prizes for the best swimmers. Finally, the transports received orders to sail for Cuba. There were thirty-two in total, including a schooner filled with drinking water. To protect the transports from potential attacks, they were escorted by five war-ships initially, later joined by fourteen more. In total, there were eight hundred officers and sixteen thousand enlisted men on board. The troops were to be landed on the southeast coast of Cuba near Santiago Bay to advance towards Santiago. The journey lasted seven days, with the ships moving in a broad column by day and clustering together at night. The men relaxed on deck during the voyage, chatting, sleeping, or playing games. As the transports approached Santiago Bay, they saw the American war-ships containing Admiral Cervera's fleet. The Rough Riders and other troops landed at Daiquiri, east of Santiago Harbor. The landing was secured by war-ships firing shots to clear any potential threats. Most soldiers disembarked at Daiquiri or a nearby landing. The soldiers were met by Cubans in need of food, showing no sign of enemy presence.|"1. What was the refreshing activity mentioned in the text?
