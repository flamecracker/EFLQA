"Mazin' Grace's first outing with Nell was to the ""Christian an' Debil"" Society. Despite her limping from recent blisters, her smile reflected pure joy. Both girls proudly wore new watermelon stockings. Alligators, a source of curiosity up North, are still plentiful in the South. They are hunted mainly at night with torches. Contrary to belief, alligators are easily shot but resilient. They nest in mud, lay many eggs, but cannibalistic tendencies hinder population growth. Alligators eat anything, including pine chips. They can travel long distances overland to find water. Hides are preserved and sold, with ten thousand killed annually in Florida. Conflicting reports exist on their size. A tale of ""Big Ben,"" a cunning alligator, showcases a clever hunter's ruse to bring him down."|"1. What was the first outing Mazin' Grace had with Nell?

Once, I had a strange encounter with an alligator in Florida. It was a female protecting her young. During a trip up the St. John's River, we were approached by two men who hunted alligators and plume-birds. While exploring an alligator nest, we faced a big alligator charging at us. Only one man had a rifle, and he shot the alligator down its throat, causing it to sink away. In the Amazon River, alligators grow huge due to few hunters. I once found a piraña inside a dead alligator. Alligators in the Amazon are said to be more aggressive than those in the Southern States. The heat in Charleston on August 31, 1886, was unbearable, with no relief even at night. The sky had a misty, tropical appearance. While chatting with friends, a strange rumbling noise approached, like distant thunder but from below, growing louder until it was upon us.|"1.

The sturdy brick house we were in started to sway gently, then with increasing force, making us spring to our feet. We held hands, staring at the tottering walls. The floor beneath us heaved like a ship in a storm, and debris crashed around us. We realized we were in an earthquake. The house's motion turned vertical, as if a giant toyed with it. Staggering, we rushed to the jammed front door, trapped until the quake stopped. After a final convulsion, the earth settled, leaving us shaken. Chunks of the neighboring house fell into our garden, luckily avoiding harm. We managed to open the door and joined neighbors in the street, suffocated by the smell of sulfur. Another milder shock followed, and the city braced for the worst. Despite destruction in parts, the death toll was surprisingly low. The aftermath of the earthquake highlighted the resilience and sacrifices of the people, often overlooked in historical accounts.|"1. What caused the characters to realize they were in an earthquake?

During the fall season, the hogs were brought in from the fields to fatten them up. They were kept in a pen next to the road, hidden under a woodpile except for a small opening in the back where they were fed. To avoid detection by passing soldiers, the hogs were fed quickly when an army was approaching, ensuring they were napping during the march.
