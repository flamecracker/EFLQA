Our group had dinner at one of the two hotels in the hamlet. With time before the meal, those not weary explored the village. They found about 200 cottages, much like their own, in small yards along three narrow streets. These streets ran parallel to the bluff and were separated by cross-lanes. The rich men's summer homes were on a slight rise toward Nantucket Town. The town was explored, dinner eaten, and then they headed to the beach. The waves rushed and sprayed as they broke along the shore. After a rest, they woke up and began to inquire about the island's sights and amusements. They split into groups for various activities. Some went for a drive together, while others preferred different sports. They all got ready in their bathing suits and went down to the beach for a swim. There were no accidents, and everyone enjoyed the bathing. The next morning, some went to Nantucket Town, while others stayed back for more beach time. The Nantucket group visited the bathing house and the town's notable places. They explored the Athenaeum, the oldest house, and stores with antique furniture and crockery.|"1.
