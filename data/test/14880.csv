"Here is the refined passage for middle school students:

In the English language, words are made up of different sounds called phonemes. These phonemes are represented by letters or combinations of letters. For example, the letter 'b' can make sounds like 'buh' in words like 'bubble' and 'band.' Similarly, the letter 'd' can make sounds like 'duh' in words like 'did' and 'door.' Understanding these sounds and how they combine to form words is essential for reading and spelling. By recognizing the sounds each letter makes, we can decode words and improve our language skills.

The tree's whitish bark is somewhat rough, always adorned with leaves at small intervals on opposite sides of the bough. It bears blossoms, green, and ripe fruit simultaneously. The small green fruit, akin to a cherry, is delightful to eat. Inside this cherry-like fruit lies the coffee bean or berry, enveloped in a delicate skin. Initially soft and unpleasant, the berry hardens as the cherry ripens, transforming into a deep brown shell. The translucent green berry contains two seeds, one rounded and the other flat. In a prized variation, the seeds fuse to form a pea berry. After ripening, the husks are separated from the berries, which are then sold. The plants, when young, are pruned to easily access the fruit, reaching full bearing by the sixth or seventh year and continuing for over two decades. The coffee undergoes roasting before use, with the aromatic oil content impacting its market value. Arabia's Mocha coffee is renowned as the finest globally, followed by Java coffee from the East Indies, and Rio coffee from South America is favored by many due to its accessibility.|"1.

In all your actions, have good intentions. Being kind and helpful is important, but it's equally crucial to dedicate yourself earnestly to whatever task you undertake. Let's take Thomas as an example. His parents enrolled him in a business program, but Thomas lacks enthusiasm. He often neglects his responsibilities, focusing on trivial matters and sometimes even engaging in harmful activities. Instead of prioritizing his employer's interests or personal growth, he opts for fleeting pleasures with friends. Consequently, he performs inadequately, not due to a lack of ability but a lack of commitment. By contrast, consider James, an average student. Despite facing tough competition, James excels because of his sincere dedication. He is reliable, trustworthy, and well-liked by customers. Through hard work, self-improvement, and positive behavior, James is building a solid foundation for a successful future.|"1. What is the main idea of the passage?

"""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" This wise saying teaches us not to judge others harshly, for we will be judged in the same way. Instead of focusing on the faults of others, we should first address our own shortcomings. It is hypocritical to try to fix someone else's problems while ignoring our own. By being sincere and self-aware, we can help others more effectively. Asking, seeking, and knocking will open doors for us, just as a caring parent gives good gifts to their child. Following these teachings is like building a house on a strong foundation, ensuring it stands firm in the face of challenges."|"6.
