Since arriving at Camp Wau-Wau, I have been exhausted. The moment I hit the bed, I'm out like a light. Last night, I barely woke up before tripping over a tent rope in response to the alarm. It was quite the jolt. The guardians have made a decision about the six girls who confessed. While they can't act on the others yet, they believe the six acted in jest, not malice. So, the remaining campers will vote on their punishment. Despite some objections, the penalty of 24-hour solitary confinement in their tents was imposed. Harriet received honors for her bravery and forgiving nature. The Council Fire session ended with Harriet feeling sorrow for the girls facing punishment and those who didn't confess. She understood the difficulty of admitting guilt but knew honesty was key.|"1. What caused the narrator to trip over a tent rope last night?
