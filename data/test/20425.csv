The song placed at the beginning of the Peace Egg Play has additional verses that tell the story of the play. However, they are not noteworthy. Another song, possibly from a different version, features a quarrel between St. George and the Old Fool, with accusations of clothes theft. St. George seeks advice on love matters from Man Jack.
