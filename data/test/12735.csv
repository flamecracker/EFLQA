Dick proposed a new way to determine the winning school in a swimming contest. He suggested that each school should enter seven swimmers, and the school with the swimmers finishing ahead of the other school's swimmers would win. This would prevent schools from entering one strong swimmer and six weaker ones to win easily. By having seven swimmers from each school, it would showcase the average abilities of the swimmers from both schools. Len suggested involving the editor of the local paper as the umpire to settle the dispute.
