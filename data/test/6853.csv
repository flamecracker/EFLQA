"""I understand what he's thinking,"" she mentioned flatly. ""I know more than I would like to, Betty. Joseph has purchased the Warren lots, and that implies he's obtained them for his own terms. Old man Warren is elderly, and these lots have been divided into building plots on the stone road across Laurel Grove where the trolley's arriving this spring. Joseph will likely sell them for thrice what he paid. That's why he hasn't registered the deed; Warren's children will find out, and I doubt the sale would stand in court. Everyone knows the old man isn't capable of managing his property. There were talks of appointing one of the sons as his guardian some time ago. Joseph has convinced him to sell. If he wasn't my husband, I'd say it's a clear scam.""

""No, he couldn't claim the lots,"" acknowledged Joseph Peabody's wife. ""But he could keep the deed and threaten to inform George Warren if Joseph didn't pay him a hefty sum. I'm not saying he would, Betty, but he could. That's what Joseph thinks he might do.""

""Well, I find that very foolish,"" said Betty energetically. ""Bob Henderson isn't a thief or a blackmailer, no matter what Mr. Peabody believes. That deed is probably in another coat pocket right now, or he might have lost it in Glenside.""
