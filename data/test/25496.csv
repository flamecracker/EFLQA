We informed the kind lady about our situation. She was friendly, though quite stout, and advised us against wandering alone. Despite assuring her of our safety, Oswald was relieved that Alice hadn't changed into smarter clothes before leaving. The woman directed us to Rose Gardens through a series of turns and alleys, mentioning the presence of Chinamen in the area. Grateful for the guidance, Alice thanked the woman and received a kiss. As we proceeded down Nightingale Street towards the alley, we encountered a group of boys harassing an elderly Chinaman. Reacting swiftly, Alice bravely intervened, slapping one of the boys. A scuffle ensued, with Alice and the boys engaging in a physical altercation until another Chinaman arrived and helped us drive the boys away. Oswald and Dicky assessed their injuries while Alice, overcome with emotion, burst into tears, a common reaction to the scratches and kicks she had received.|"1.

Alice, appearing disheveled with her hair leaning to one side, agreed that they had come to commend the Doge's chapter. However, she blurted it out abruptly, perhaps forgetting herself. Oswald, in a state of disarray, couldn't speak. The hat elastic was slowly sliding up the back of his head, and he feared it would catapult off if it passed the bump on his head. The Editor acknowledged the success of the chapter, receiving sixteen glowing letters about it. He then discreetly gestured for Oswald to cover his boots with his petticoats.

After a pleasant ride in a wagon, we arrived at Miss Sandal's charming white house near the village. The house had a unique feature of an old windmill where fishermen stored their nets.

As we explored the area, we learned about seagulls cracking shells to eat clams. Miss Sandal, usually composed, showed a rare moment of agitation when a telegram arrived, disrupting her usual calm demeanor.

When Oswald and Dicky first boarded the boat, they were curious about the kegs but were quickly told to stop asking. Oswald started to worry that their grand plan had been abandoned.

The sky seemed higher, the stars further away, and the fish abundance from the deep sea made everything feel immense. After a successful haul, the boys were surprised by a coastguard from Longbeach, who had been unkind to them before. Despite the mixed-up smells on the boat, they all worked together efficiently to unload the fish. Oswald felt a sense of impending trouble due to the coastguard's presence.|"1.
