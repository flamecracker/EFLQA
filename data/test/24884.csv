Mining is only possible in regions abundant in minerals. Miners must go where the mineral wealth is, regardless of climate or topography. Two things are essential: the minerals and a way to transport them to people. In the past, each region in the United States was self-sustaining, producing its own food and goods. The means of transportation were limited to ox-carts, pack-horses, and rafts. However, this independence limited knowledge and advancements.

The construction of a canal, whether through one route or another, will have a significant impact on global trade, surpassing even the effects of the Suez Canal's creation. This new route will bring San Francisco closer to London than Calcutta currently is, shortening the sea journey between the United States' Atlantic ports and those of China and Japan by over eight thousand miles. The Hawaiian Islands, already a vital hub for ocean trade, will see a substantial increase in importance, solidifying their status as a key commercial center. While water transport is cost-effective, railways dominate the transportation of goods in the United States and western Europe due to the need for speedy deliveries. Time is of the essence in modern business, especially in densely populated areas like New York, London, or Berlin, where perishable food items must arrive promptly. This demand for punctuality drives the preference for rail transport over maritime routes, even though the latter may be cheaper. The advancement of railway technology, such as the use of Bessemer steel, has significantly improved the efficiency and capacity of locomotives, allowing for greater loads and faster speeds. This progress has led to a substantial decrease in rail transport costs and increased the speed and reliability of freight and passenger transportation.

During the mid-19th century, the concept of railway management evolved significantly. Initially, people viewed railways as public highways where anyone could operate their conveyances by paying a toll, similar to canals. However, the introduction of steam locomotives made this idea impractical, leading to the necessity of organized railway systems. By 1850, England had almost 400 railway companies, while the US required a dozen to connect New York City and Buffalo. The consolidation of connecting lines became common practice, reducing operating costs and improving services. This consolidation also led to the extension of railway lines, connecting previously isolated regions. While some railways were built for speculative purposes, others opened up new industries and lands for development. Competition between railways was fierce, often resulting in rate wars and financial losses for companies.|"1. What led to the necessity of organized railway systems during the mid-19th century?

Between 1870 and 1880, railway companies faced challenges due to rate-cutting and competition. State laws prevented the consolidation of trunk lines, leading to struggles in maintaining rates. To address this, companies resorted to dividing territory, traffic, or earnings, known as pooling. While traffic division is simpler, it can be unsatisfactory. Earnings division is more complex as each company may be unhappy with their share. Despite legal challenges, pooling has generally improved railway services. However, it has raised concerns about increased railway power. To regulate fair rates, governments must balance the cost of service and what customers can afford. Freight rates consider factors like loading costs and distance. Classifying freights into categories helps determine charges fairly. Handling through freights between multiple companies can lead to pricing conflicts.|"1.

Railway systems have faced challenges in balancing long and short hauls, leading to the creation of pools and traffic associations to prevent rate wars, which can harm both the community and railway companies. Legislation has been enacted to address these issues, with some laws proving beneficial while others have negative impacts. Passenger service is typically more regulated than freight, with rates set by law, varying from two to five cents per mile. Long-distance rates are lower than local rates and are determined by joint associations. Passenger service is generally less profitable than freight, with some railways considering discontinuing passenger trains. Rate-cutting has decreased due to joint associations but still occurs through ticket brokers. Differential rates are offered by faster services between the same terminal points. The United States has a vast railway network, with the majority of lines running east-west to connect production centers with distribution hubs.|"1.

In the United States, many country highways are dirt roads filled with dust in dry weather and nearly impossible to travel on in the winter. These roads make it difficult for farmers to transport their grain to railway stations, often costing more than the journey from the station to London. Recognizing the importance of good roads for commercial development, efforts are being made to improve important highways by grading and surfacing them. This improvement not only eases intercommunication but also reduces transportation costs by half and minimizes vehicle wear. The uneven distribution of the world's population shows that about nine-tenths live in lowland plains where food grows, while the rest reside in grass-producing regions, mining areas, or flood-plains. The population is divided into rural and urban areas, with agricultural regions like the United States and western Europe fostering rural life, while places like Russia see agricultural populations clustering in villages. Urban populations tend to concentrate in cities and villages for reasons like facilitating the distribution and transportation of goods, manufacturing products, access to good harbors, and necessary minerals for industries. Towns often emerge as centers for receiving and distributing commodities, with country stores acting as clearinghouses for various goods and farm products. These towns usually develop in accessible locations, such as highway crossings, river landing spots, fording places, bridges, ferries, toll gates, or convenient resting points along a journey. Many towns have started from simple sidings along railway tracks, demonstrating the importance of transportation infrastructure in shaping urban centers.|"1.

The production of wheat varies depending on rainfall and cultivation skill. In Western Europe, the yield is two to three times higher than in the United States, while in Russia and India, it is lower. The consumption of wheat is rapidly increasing in the US, Europe, and China. Without significant increases in crop acreage or yield per acre by 1931, the US may lack surplus for export. Irrigating arid lands and improving cultivation methods can boost yields. Corn, derived from the American continent, is the staple food in the US. It requires rich soil, long summers, and warm nights to thrive. The US is the top corn producer, yielding over two billion bushels annually. Skilful cultivation methods can double corn yields per acre, making it a valuable food source due to its high fatty content and heating power.|"1.

"In the United States, most of the corn crop is used to feed livestock such as pigs and cows. While a pound of corn is worth only a third of a cent in the market, when it is fed to animals, it can increase in value to five or six times more. Corn has various uses besides being a staple food. It is used to make starch, which is a delicacy in America and Europe. Glucose, a sugar substitute, can be derived from corn. The oil from corn can be used as a rubber substitute, and the stalk's pith is used to create smokeless powder and explosives. Additionally, a significant portion of corn is used in liquor production.

Rye is a cereal grass seed that grows in soils unsuitable for wheat. It is predominantly grown in the sandy plain extending from the Netherlands to central Russia. Rye-bread is typically sour and is primarily consumed where it is grown. The United States produces about twenty-five million bushels of rye annually, with a small portion exported to Europe.

Barley, another seed from cereal grass, is one of the oldest bread-stuffs. It can be grown further north than wheat and has a wide cultivation range.

Silk production is a meticulous process. Cocoons are collected and then submerged in hot water to kill the chrysalids and soften the cocoons for the removal of the outer cases. The remaining cocoon is soaked in warm water to loosen the fibers for reeling. These fibers are then twisted into strands to create raw silk, which is used in commerce. Some raw silk is further twisted into a coarse thread known as thrown silk. The silk is then made into large skeins called hanks for export. A small quantity of cocoons yields good raw silk, while the rest is used to make inferior quality silk thread. The tradition of sericulture dates back to the smuggling of silk-worm eggs to India. China is a major producer of silk, exporting tussar silk commercially. Additionally, flax, the source of linen cloth, is derived from the bast of the flax plant. It is a versatile crop that grows well in various climates. Russia is the largest flax producer globally, with Belgium known for producing high-quality Courtrai fiber due to the water quality in the Lys River.|"1.

Coffee, once forbidden to followers of Islam due to its stimulating effects, became popular for its ability to keep people alert during long religious practices. Initially confined to Arabia, coffee cultivation spread to the Dutch East Indies, particularly Java, which became a major global supplier. Today, Java is the second-largest coffee producer after Brazil. Coffee trees thrive in fertile red soil and moist climates with temperatures between 55°F and 80°F. The coffee fruit, a deep-red berry, contains seeds that are harvested, pulped, sun-cured, hulled, cleaned, and then sold. The quality of coffee improves with age, and sorting is crucial for premium beans. Different types of coffee are named based on their origin, like Rio from Brazil, Maracaibo from Venezuela, and Java from East India. Sorting coffee beans by size using machinery is common, but hand-sorting is necessary for removing imperfect beans.|"1. What was the initial reason for coffee being forbidden to followers of Islam?

Initially confined to Arabia, coffee cultivation spread to the Dutch East Indies, particularly Java, which became a major global supplier. Today, Java is the second-largest coffee producer after Brazil. Coffee trees thrive in fertile red soil and moist climates with temperatures between 55°F and 80°F. The coffee fruit, a deep-red berry, contains seeds that are harvested, pulped, sun-cured, hulled, cleaned, and then sold. The quality of coffee improves with age, and sorting is crucial for premium beans. Different types of coffee are named based on their origin, like Rio from Brazil, Maracaibo from Venezuela, and Java from East India. Sorting coffee beans by size using machinery is common, but hand-sorting is necessary for removing imperfect beans.|"6. Why is hand-sorting necessary for coffee beans?

Mocha coffee, once famous in Arabia, is now traded in Hodeida. The best beans are sent to cities like Constantinople and Cairo, fetching high prices. Java coffee is renowned for its flavor, especially after aging. The United States consumes the most coffee globally, almost eleven pounds per person annually. Chicory is sometimes added to coffee as an enhancer. Tea, made from dried leaves of the _Thea chinensis_ shrub, has been a Chinese commodity for centuries. The plants are carefully monitored during the three or four harvests each year, with the April harvest producing the best leaves. Tea plants thrive in red, new soils and are picked only when they are a few years old. Green and black teas are the two main types, distinguished by their preparation methods rather than plant variety.|"1. What is a famous type of coffee traded in Hodeida?

"Tea Production and Trade

After harvesting, tea leaves undergo a process where they are partially crushed and left to wither until they start to change color to brown. The leaves are then hand-rolled and dried slowly under the sun or quickly over a charcoal fire, a method called ""firing."" Black tea results from the slow drying process, while green tea comes from the rapid method. Green tea can be enhanced with a mixture of powdered gypsum and Prussian blue for color. The Chinese export their tea in wooden chests lined with sheet-lead, while Japan uses moisture-tight packaging. India, China, Japan, and Java are the major tea producers.

The cacao tree, originally from Mexico, is now grown in tropical America and the West Indies. The fruit is large pods harvested in June and December. The seeds undergo fermentation for days to develop their flavor. Roasted seeds become cocoa nibs, and the husks are cocoa shells. Ecuador is a major cacao producer, with Guayaquil a key market. Venezuelan and Brazilian cacao, known as Caracas and Trinidad cacao, are highly valued. Spain, Portugal, and France are top buyers, with Spain having the highest consumption. Cacao is both a stimulant and a food, rich in fat, starch, and nutrients. Cocoa butter, a byproduct, does not spoil. Chocolate is made by mixing cocoa with sugar and flavoring, then hardening it in molds. It is mainly used in making sweets. Maté, or Paraguay tea, is a stimulant leaf from a shrub found in Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay. It is processed similarly to tea leaves.

Various resins and gums are utilized in arts and sciences, often originating from plant sap. For instance, commercial lac is obtained from fig tree branches in India, forming stick-lac, seed-lac, and shell-lac. Shell-lac is widely known for sealing wax and varnishes due to its inflammable properties. Dammar from East Indies serves as a base for white varnish, while copal, sourced from South America and Africa, is a common varnish ingredient. Kauri, a fossil gum from New Zealand, and amber from Prussia are used in making varnishes and tobacco pipe mouthpieces. Sandarach, found on the African coast, is a popular varnish ingredient in Europe. The United States and Great Britain are major consumers of these products.

Gold is a precious metal that is widely distributed in nature. It can be found in rocks, sea-water, beach-sands, alluvial deposits, and mountain soils. Despite its widespread presence, all the gold ever mined could fit in a large New York bank. Gold is often found in quartz veins within granitic or volcanic rocks. These veins are mined, crushed, and the gold is extracted using methods like dissolving it in quicksilver, potassium cyanide, or chlorine solutions. Natural forces can weather quartz veins, leading to the formation of placer deposits where gold is carried by water and deposited downstream. Most gold in the United States comes from states like Colorado, California, and Alaska. Globally, countries like Australia and South Africa are major gold producers. Gold is used for various purposes like gilding, jewelry making, and as a medium of exchange, with its value being stable due to high demand and limited supply.|"1.

The refining process is so efficient that raw sugar imported from Europe or the West Indies at around 2.25 to 2.5 cents per pound is refined and sold for about five cents per pound. To protect the sugar industry, the United States and many European countries impose tariffs on imported raw sugar. The beet-sugar industry in Europe is supported by government bounties on exported sugar. The production and consumption of sugar increased significantly in the 19th century due to decreased prices. Molasses, a byproduct of sugar refining, is mainly used in the production of rum.|"5. What supports the beet-sugar industry in Europe according to the passage?

Syrup, a purified form of molasses, is typically made by boiling raw sugar until it reaches the right concentration. Some syrups are derived from sorghum-cane sap, while others are glucose solutions colored with caramel. Maple syrup, once made from maple sugar, is now often produced from clarified raw cane sugar with added flavoring. Glucose, also known as grape sugar, is the natural sugar found in grapes and many small fruits. Honey is a concentrated solution of glucose. Glucose is used in confectionery and is mainly made from cornstarch. It is a significant export from the United States to Great Britain, with an annual value of around four million dollars. Wood is a crucial material, widely used for construction, fuel, and furniture. Forests cover vast areas of the earth, providing essential resources like ornamental woods, rubber, and timber. The depletion of forests due to human activities like burning and logging has led to a scarcity of quality timber, emphasizing the importance of sustainable forest management.|"1.

Forestry is the management of forests, and in Europe, the government is responsible for protecting them. Each year, only a limited number of mature trees can be cut down, and for each tree removed, several million new trees are planted. In the United States, where forest fires destroy valuable timber each year, not enough is being done to prevent this or replant trees. Some states promote tree-planting, with Arbor Day being a holiday in several. The government has set up timber preserves in the West, and New York has turned the Adirondack region into a large preserve. To grow high-quality lumber, trees must be clear of knots at least 15 feet from the ground. Forests in the U.S. typically grow in sandy and gravelly soils, with some areas remaining treeless due to fires or lack of seed planting.|"1.

The sturgeon is mainly caught in temperate rivers and lakes. Some from the Black Sea can weigh up to 2,000 pounds. Their eggs are used to make caviar, a popular product in Europe and America, with some made in Maine. Russian caviar is well-known and exported. The tunny is found in the Mediterranean, while anchovies are caught along the European coast for sauces. Sea cucumbers, or beche-de-mer, are popular in Asia. Oysters are abundant in the U.S., especially in Chesapeake Bay and Long Island Sound. Lobster consumption has led to a decrease in the New England catch, making the U.S. an importer. Fish hatcheries help restock waters to meet the high demand for fish. Sponges are harvested from the sea floor, mainly in Florida and the Bahamas. Fur seals are found in cold waters, with the Pribilof Islands being a major sealing ground.|"1. What is the main use of sturgeon eggs?

"The West Indies have a tropical climate and produce sugar, fruit, coffee, tobacco, and cacao. The sugar industry faced challenges due to factors like the abolition of slavery and competition from beet-sugar in Europe. Cuba, the largest island, is known for its ""Havana"" tobacco, highly regarded for its flavor. Despite setbacks from wars and insurrections, Cuba remains a productive region, with most of its tobacco exported to the United States. The high tariff on sugar imports into the United States further impacted the sugar industry in the early 1900s. The West Indies primarily trade with the United States, importing goods like flour, textile products, hardware, and coal-oil.

"The West Indies have a tropical climate and produce sugar, fruit, coffee, tobacco, and cacao. The sugar industry faced challenges due to factors like the abolition of slavery and competition from beet-sugar in Europe. Cuba, the largest island, is known for its ""Havana"" tobacco, highly regarded for its flavor. Despite setbacks from wars and insurrections, Cuba remains a productive region, with most of its tobacco exported to the United States. The high tariff on sugar imports into the United States further impacted the sugar industry in the early 1900s. The West Indies primarily trade with the United States, importing goods like flour, textile products, hardware, and coal-oil. The British territories in the West Indies, like the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Barbados, also play significant roles in exporting products such as sugar, rum, and asphaltum."|"2.

"Ecuador is known for its production of ""Panama"" hats made from toquilla straw. The hats are crafted by indigenous people who follow their own unique style and shape preferences. These hats are in high demand in American markets, fetching prices ranging from twenty-five to fifty dollars each. In terms of transportation, mule-paths are the primary means of inland communication, with local traffic increasing during the rainy seasons. Additionally, Ecuador's railway system, managed by an American company, connects the city of Guayaquil to inland regions. Bolivia, on the other hand, faced challenges after losing its coastal land to Chile, impacting its commercial future. Bolivia relies heavily on mining for its economic prosperity, with silver, tin, copper, gold, and borate of lime being the main products. The state is working on improving transportation infrastructure to boost its mining industry. Chile, with its limited cultivable land, has efficiently managed its resources and has become a leading Andean state despite this limitation."|"1. What is Ecuador known for producing?

In South America, the eastern countries have diverse terrains. The llanos and pampas are grassy plains suitable for grazing, while the silvas of the Amazon are dense forests. Coastal plains in tropical regions are often unhealthy, leading to cities being built on higher ground. Venezuela, for instance, is primarily llanos, with pleasant mountain-valleys being the main inhabited areas due to the climate. The plains flood in the rainy season and are dry during droughts, making them unsuitable for living. Coffee and cacao are cultivated in different regions, and sugar production is encouraged by banning imports. Forest products like rubber and tonka beans are valuable. Cattle in the llanos provide poor-quality hides and beef. Mining for gold, coal, iron ore, and asphaltum is active, with pearl-fisheries and commercial ports playing significant roles.|"**1.

Coal is found in various areas stretching from the River Clyde to the River Severn. The yearly production from these mines was around 225 million tons at the end of the century. Due to heavy extraction in the past, the future output is expected to decrease significantly. A portion of this coal, nearly one-sixth, is sold to consumers in Russia and Mediterranean countries, but there is a growing sentiment against selling coal to foreign buyers. Iron ores are plentiful, but the specific hematite needed for Bessemer steel is limited to the Manchester and Birmingham region. Great Britain now imports ores from foreign markets due to the scarcity of this ore. The Clyde basin's coal is mainly used for making railway iron, steamship material, and rolling stock. The production of Bessemer steel is shifting towards South Wales, where foreign pig-iron can be landed cheaply. The central England coal-fields are a major manufacturing hub, hosting large woollen and cotton mills, machinery, cutlery, and pottery plants. Britain's import trade focuses on food and raw materials, with cotton being the most significant. Cotton comes from various regions like the United States, the Nile delta, Brazil, India, Iran, and Peru.

The Lower Danube States, which include Romania and Bulgaria, are nestled between the Carpathian and Balkan ranges. This region serves as a vast wheat-producing area, with key trade routes being the Iron Gate leading to Germanic Europe and the Sulina mouth of the Danube opening into the Black Sea. The primary industries revolve around growing maize for local consumption and wheat for export. Most of the grain is transported along the Danube and sold in countries like Great Britain and Germany. The Danube is an international waterway from the Iron Gate to the Black Sea, overseen by a commission based in Galatz, Romania. Notably, the Balkan Mountains house the renowned Vale of Roses, responsible for about half of the world's attar-of-roses supply. This fragrant oil is extracted by pressing damask rose petals soaked in lard. The region is also known for producing rugs. Key markets include Galatz and Rustchuk, with a railway connecting Rustchuk to Varna, a major Black Sea port. Additionally, Sofia, near the Bulgarian border, serves as a railway hub linking to western Europe.|"1. What are the primary industries in the Lower Danube States?

The Lower Danube States, which include Romania and Bulgaria, are nestled between the Carpathian and Balkan ranges. This region serves as a vast wheat-producing area, with key trade routes being the Iron Gate leading to Germanic Europe and the Sulina mouth of the Danube opening into the Black Sea. The primary industries revolve around growing maize for local consumption and wheat for export. Most of the grain is transported along the Danube and sold in countries like Great Britain and Germany. The Danube is an international waterway from the Iron Gate to the Black Sea, overseen by a commission based in Galatz, Romania. Notably, the Balkan Mountains house the renowned Vale of Roses, responsible for about half of the world's attar-of-roses supply. This fragrant oil is extracted by pressing damask rose petals soaked in lard. The region is also known for producing rugs. Key markets include Galatz and Rustchuk, with a railway connecting Rustchuk to Varna, a major Black Sea port.

"Greece, a country with limited arable land and a need to import much of its food, faces challenges due to deforestation affecting water resources and agriculture. The country's short railway lines limit connections to major trade hubs, but its strategic location and seafaring tradition benefit its commerce. Greek merchants dominate the grain trade between the Black and Mediterranean Seas, with exports like currants, fruit, and iron ore. Despite a growing cotton, wool, and silk industry, exports struggle to balance imports of American cotton and Russian wheat. In contrast, Serbia and Montenegro focus on livestock trade with Austria. Athens serves as the capital, while the Corinthian canal boosts Greek commerce.

In Anatolia, a Turkish region comprising Asia Minor, Armenia, Kurdistan, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Arabia, rugs play a vital role in households. Essential items like hearth-rugs, bath-mats, divan-covers, sleeping-blankets, and saddle-mats are considered necessities due to the absence of floors and furniture in many dwellings. Each district and people have unique rug designs and methods of production. These hand-woven rugs are often named after the town or district where they are made. The rugs are gathered by caravans and shipped to ports like Smyrna and Constantinople, with New York being a major rug market. While most rugs are priced between ten to fifty dollars, exceptional pieces can fetch prices ranging from three hundred to ten thousand dollars. The Armenians, known for their business acumen, dominate trade in these regions despite facing persecution.

"**Independent African States**

Many independent African states are considered underdeveloped and have limited global significance. Abyssinia, for example, boasts natural resources like gold, iron, and fertile lands suitable for cotton cultivation. Foreign companies have secured mining rights in the region, and valuable exports such as ivory, coffee, and gold are traded for textiles in India. While a railway is being constructed, transportation mainly relies on mule-trains, particularly to Harrar.

Morocco, strategically located at the Strait of Gibraltar, may eventually become a Spanish possession. The country exports goods like beans, almonds, goat-skins, and wool, with the latter used for premium book-binding leather.

Australia has transformed into a significant meat exporter with the introduction of cold-storage plants on steamships. Mutton, in particular, is a substantial export, reaching London at a low cost. Wheat is primarily grown for local consumption, while grapes are cultivated for wine and raisins, finding a market in Great Britain. Australian claret competes with California claret and is well-received. Queensland produces cane sugar, supplying the commonwealth and nearby islands. The country's forests yield abundant hardwoods, with jarrah wood paving-blocks being a key export. Gold mining is a major industry, especially in the Ballarat district. Extensive railway networks support the country's trade, with most built by private entities but later acquired by the government. Great Britain dominates Australia's trade, with the United States being a significant partner. New Zealand, a thriving colony, focuses on wheat, cattle, sheep, and dairy exports.|"1.

"Three roads, A, B, and C, connect Chicago and New York City. Road C is the shortest but has steep grades. Road B is longer but has easier grades. Road A is indirect, requiring trans-shipment at Boston or New London. If a ton-mile rate is set for one road, the others must adjust rates. Road B, with manageable grades, can set rates for better returns. Road C follows suit, while Road A operates at a small profit. If A is outside the U.S., it can openly cut rates. Meanwhile, roads X, Y, and Z compete for freight from Buffalo eastward. B and C often divide through business, offering a ""differential"" rate to A. Such complexities in rate-setting are seen in cases like Danville and Lynchburg's trade competition. The Southern Railway charged differently due to competition, leading to a legal dispute. In cases like these, consolidation of roads may be the only solution to maintain fair rates for all parties involved."|"1.

For example, in New England and the middle Atlantic states, Early Genesee Giant, Jones Winter Fife, and Fultz are commonly grown. Southern states prefer Fultz, Fulcaster, Purple Straw, and May. The north-central states plant Early Red Clawson, Poole, Dawson's Golden Chaff, Buda Pest, and Fultz. In the Dakotas and Minnesota, Scotch Fife and Velvet Blue Stem are typical spring wheat choices. Kansas and Texas opt for Turkey, Fulcaster, and Mediterranean winter wheats. California and the southern plateau region favor Sonora, California Club, and Defiance winter wheats. Washington and Oregon grow Little Club, Red Chaff, and Blue Stem as their main varieties. The process of transferring wheat from the Middle West to the seaboard involves elevators equipped with ""legs"" that efficiently load grain onto vessels. Buffalo's elevators can fill a canal-boat in an hour and load six grain-cars in five minutes. Most wheat from the northwest is shipped from Duluth through the St. Marys Falls Canal to Buffalo before being transferred to railcars or canal-boats for export."|"1.

"In 1823, Mackintosh, a Scotchman, discovered that rubber gum dissolves in benzine, leading to the creation of waterproof cloth bearing his name. Before 1850, pencils used metallic lead instead of graphite, which later became the norm. Pencil hardness is adjusted by mixing clay with powdered graphite. Limestone aids in smelting by creating a liquid slag, known as a flux. Clearing-houses facilitate quick payment settlements among banks, even though the total yearly payments exceed two billion dollars. Brands, like initials or monograms, were registered and seared onto animals for identification. Disputes arose when sheep-graziers demanded access to fenced government land, causing conflicts with cattle ranchers and rustlers. ""Chinook winds"" in wheat-growing regions provide essential warmth. Vegetable ivory, from a palm seed, resembles real ivory. Coca leaves, known for their stimulant effects, contain cocaine used in surgeries worldwide."|"1.
