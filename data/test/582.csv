Mr. Tod's curtains were neatly folded and stored away since the house was empty, just like the counterpane. Tommy Brock, on the other hand, was only covered with a blanket.

Ribby was surprised to find a broken pie-dish in the yard. She couldn't believe it! She thought all her pie-dishes were in the cupboard. Next time she hosts a party, she'll invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit. Meanwhile, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck didn't want to sit on a nest for 28 days to hatch eggs. She had a sackful of feathers for a nest and told Jemima Puddle-duck she could sit there as long as she liked. Jemima laid nine large greeny white eggs that the gentleman fox admired. Jemima planned to start sitting on the eggs the next day and promised never to leave them. The gentleman fox requested herbs for an omelette, and Jemima agreed to bring them. Aunt Pettitoes' eight piglets had big appetites. One got stuck in the pig trough, and another ate soap on laundry day. Aunt Pettitoes was not pleased.|"1. What surprised Ribby in the text?
