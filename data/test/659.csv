Jerry, with an empty stomach, walked to a city market hoping to steal food. He was skilled at stealing barrels, which were valuable to coopers. Barrels fetched twenty-five cents each, a tempting reward for young thieves. Jerry roamed the market seeking an opportunity to grab an apple or banana, but the vigilant stand owners thwarted his plans. Feeling hungry and regretful, Jerry wished he had sold his new shirt for fifty cents to buy breakfast and cigars. While pretending to casually inspect a barrel, he plotted to steal it. Unbeknownst to him, a policeman observed his scheme and apprehended him. The next day, Mrs. Hoffman joyfully sewed shirts for Mr. Preston, earning five dollars a week instead of a dollar and a half. Jimmy diligently painted a picture of a farmer in a cart, showcasing his talent. False pride hindered a job-seeking man from accepting a porter position, highlighting the importance of humility.|"1.
