The beautiful meadows and plains were mostly deserted, with only a few underground people passing by in a rush. Rarely did they dance outdoors; only a small group would sometimes twirl about. John hardly ever saw more than half a dozen of them together. The meadows only felt lively when the earth-children, who served as helpers, were allowed to stroll outside. This occurred twice a week since they were usually busy in the great hall or at school. John discovered they had schools there too and was intrigued. He attended daily, learning reading, writing, and more. The oldest underground men, known as the Wise, imparted knowledge of the world's origins. John excelled in painting, crafting, and riddle-making. His bond with Elizabeth, a girl from his village, blossomed into love. One night, as they talked about their affection, the sound of cocks crowing from above triggered a flood of emotions in Elizabeth, reminding her of the world beyond.|"1.

Once the old woman disappeared, Aslog and Orm enjoyed a peaceful and happy life. Orm's fishing nets always brought in a bountiful catch, and his arrows never missed their mark. Everything they attempted flourished. On Christmas, they tidied their home, lit a fire, and retreated to the loft as twilight fell. As darkness enveloped the island, strange lights flickered outside. Orm peered through a hole in the roof and witnessed a mesmerizing sight: islands aglow with blue lights, carried by Dwarfs with peculiar features. The Dwarfs gathered around a stone, which transformed into a gigantic figure with Guru's touch. The Dwarfs danced and sang, filling the island with eerie sounds. Orm and Aslog, petrified, observed the revelry in silence. Eventually, the creatures entered their home, feasting and dancing. Aslog, drawn by the enchanting music, watched the dance unfold, unaware of the consequences. When she inadvertently invoked Christ's name, the creatures fled in terror, leaving the house deserted. Orm and Aslog, shaken, hid until daybreak, only descending when sunlight streamed through the roof. The house was adorned with silver vessels, a golden drinking horn, and a dulcimer-like instrument, remnants of the otherworldly visitors. To their astonishment, they found the stone Giant and Guru in their midst, frozen in time. Guru wept profusely, her tears a testament|"1.
