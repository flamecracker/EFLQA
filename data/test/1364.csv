Starting with four hundred miles of our current road already electrified, we supply power to small cities along the H. & P. A. line. This setup is profitable due to the freight traffic we handle. However, if the H. & W. interferes with our monopoly, our profits will plummet. To counter this, I propose extending our electrified line through the Pas Alos Range to efficiently handle freight traffic. By developing electric locomotives capable of maintaining high speeds and powering heavy trains through challenging terrains, we can secure our position. Speed and efficiency are crucial in the modern era of transportation. I urge you, the Swifts, to focus on this project to ensure the future success of the H. & P. A.|"1.

The H. & P. A. has steep grades, with Mr. Bartholomew admitting to this. The electric freight locomotive from Jandel can manage sixteen miles per hour on these grades, reaching thirty miles per hour on flat tracks. Passenger trains under Mr. Bartholomew can go faster on level ground but struggle on steep inclines. To compete with Montagne Lewis's railway, the Hendrickton & Western, Mr. Bartholomew aims to develop faster locomotives. Tom, tasked with improving Jandel's electric locomotive patent, faces a challenge. The bonus for success is substantial, yet the costs of locomotives are high. Tom's loyal mechanic, Rad, supports him as he embarks on this important project. Despite the presence of a potential spy, Tom focuses on the task at hand, with Koku, his giant companion, ready to assist.|"1. What is Mr. Bartholomew's main goal in developing faster locomotives?

Tom had designed a powerful electric locomotive for the railroad work. The locomotive ran on a high direct current of 3,000 volts, much higher than the 550 volts used for street railway work. To ensure safety, a steel cable called a catenary supported the trolley wire. The locomotive was massive, almost 90 feet long, with a cab that concealed its complex machinery. Tom was eager to test his creation, allowing only close friends like Mary Nestor to witness the first trial. As the locomotive moved on the circular track, its immense power became evident, impressing everyone present. Tom's meticulous work and innovative designs had created a remarkable machine, showcasing his engineering skills and dedication to his project.|"2.

Tom Swift did not push the Hercules 0001 to its limits during the initial test. He circled the two-mile track multiple times before stopping near the spectators. Stepping out of the cab, he acknowledged that perfection is rare in the world. Despite imperfections, Tom remained undeterred, acknowledging that the machine was operational. However, he noted the need to modify the power-feed for improved performance. Tom explained the importance of using twin conductor trolley wires to collect current efficiently and eliminate sparks. Observers were impressed by the locomotive's potential power, envisioning its future success. Tom recognized the need for speed and efficiency for the Hercules 0001 to be of practical use. Though achieving the fictional speed of two miles per minute was unlikely, Tom believed it was within reach.|"1.

Tom confidently stated that the criminal, Andy O'Malley, would end up in prison. He blamed the failure to trace O'Malley on an incompetent operative and expressed frustration that his plans were disrupted. The young inventor, however, remained calm and suggested charging O'Malley with highway robbery for stealing his wallet. Despite acknowledging the danger O'Malley posed, the inventor expressed no personal animosity towards him.
