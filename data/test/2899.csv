Grant's critics argued that he was too authoritarian for a democratic leader, particularly due to his forceful approach to Reconstruction in the South. This policy faced backlash from Northern Republicans who saw it as a means for corruption by freedmen and carpetbaggers. Congress passed a strict act in 1871 allowing the President to suspend habeas corpus and use the military to suppress disturbances, giving radical governments in the South excessive power. Dissatisfaction led to the Liberal-Republican movement in 1872, with figures like Carl Schurz advocating for political reform. However, the movement faced challenges, including disagreements on tariffs and the selection of Horace Greeley as the presidential nominee, who alienated both Democrats and tariff reformers. Ultimately, Grant was reelected due to divisions within the opposition.|"1. What was one of the main criticisms of Grant by his critics?

During the period from 1870 to 1873, the Liberal Republican party faced challenges due to the selection of their candidate. The movement primarily attracted leaders rather than the masses, focusing on political disability removal in the South and civil service reform, which did not resonate with Western farmers. These farmers were more concerned about economic reforms like tax reduction, regulating corporations, controlling transportation costs, and increasing currency supply. While some Western Liberals supported the farmers' cause, Eastern leaders like Schurz and Trumbull distanced themselves. The era was marked by prosperity for commercial and manufacturing sectors but brought depression for farmers due to oversupply, falling prices, high interest rates, and currency fluctuations. The panic of 1873 worsened the situation, leading to financial hardships, foreclosures, and limited access to loans, prompting farmers to blame corporations and railroads for their plight.|"1.

By 1873, the Government had given the railroads roughly thirty-five million acres of land. Additionally, the Pacific railroads were promised about one hundred and forty-five million more acres. As land became scarcer, farmers were upset that railroads owned vast amounts of valuable land, either holding it for speculation or selling it at high prices. Farmers who invested in railroad stocks often lost their investments as railroads merged or went bankrupt. Farmers had little political representation, leading them to form the Grange as a way to fight against perceived injustices. Despite opposition, the Grange rapidly spread, particularly in Iowa, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Mississippi. The movement faced hurdles in the East due to competition between Eastern and Western farmers and the formation of Granges by commission men and merchants.

In 1873, the Grange underwent leadership changes, ushering in a period of significant growth.|"4. What hurdles did the Grange face in the East?
A) Competition between Eastern and Western farmers
B) Lack of leadership changes

E) Strong political representation"|A) Competition between Eastern and Western farmers|Yes
By 1873, the Government had given the railroads roughly thirty-five million acres of land. Additionally, the Pacific railroads were promised about one hundred and forty-five million more acres. As land became scarcer, farmers were upset that railroads owned vast amounts of valuable land, either holding it for speculation or selling it at high prices. Farmers who invested in railroad stocks often lost their investments as railroads merged or went bankrupt. Farmers had little political representation, leading them to form the Grange as a way to fight against perceived injustices.

"By the end of 1873, the Grange had spread to all but four states, with thirty-two state Granges established. The movement gained national significance, evident in the seventh annual session held in St. Louis in February 1874. Thirty-three men and twelve women attended, representing half a million members from thirty-two state and territorial Granges. The National Grange adopted the ""Declaration of Purposes,"" outlining goals to benefit their Order, Country, and Mankind. Their efforts focused on improving homes, advancing education, diversifying crops, and promoting cooperation in buying and selling. The Patrons aimed to combat monopolies and high freight tariffs, advocating for fair practices.

The fight for railroad regulation in Illinois began in 1869 when the legislature passed a law aiming to limit railroad rates to fair and uniform levels. However, the lack of clear rate guidelines made the law ineffective. In 1870, the state constitution was amended to direct the legislature to pass laws preventing unfair rates and discrimination. Subsequent acts established maximum passenger fares and based freight charges on distance, aiming to prevent rate increases. Despite resistance from railroad companies, the Act of 1873 introduced measures to regulate rates and prevent extortion. Similar laws were enacted in Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, but faced opposition from railroad companies. The conflict between farmers and railroads led to the establishment of laws that were eventually upheld by the courts, setting the foundation for railroad regulation in many states.|"1.

During the 1870s, the railroads used subtle methods to influence legislators. They gave favors to lawmakers who supported them, like free passes in Iowa. Lobbyists posing as farmers also worked for the railroads. The railroads fought against laws that regulated them, making them seem unfavorable. Lawsuits were brought to the Supreme Court, but many shippers were afraid to challenge the railroads. In response to laws like the Granger laws, the railroads raised rates and reduced services, causing public backlash. Eventually, most Granger laws were repealed, but the idea of regulating railroads continued to grow. The Supreme Court upheld the right of states to regulate businesses like railroads for the public good. This conflict between railroads and farmers laid the groundwork for future railroad regulations across the United States.|"1. What methods did railroads use to influence legislators during the 1870s?

The middlemen, who acted as intermediaries between farmers and retail dealers, often took advantage of their positions to strike hard deals. The commission merchants, with their storage facilities and market knowledge, could profit from market fluctuations, leaving farmers frustrated. Efforts to regulate markets or create artificial shortages rarely worked. Farmers felt the retail dealers were unjust, especially since there was little competition in small agricultural communities. Farmers believed middlemen drained wealth from agricultural classes without contributing. The Granges tried various cooperative schemes to redirect wealth to their members but faced challenges. Cooperative stores, funded by Grange members, struggled to compete with traditional merchants. Farmers' agencies for selling produce, like creameries and elevators, had more success. State Granges sometimes appointed specific firms as agents for selling produce, saving farmers money without business risks.|"1. What did the middlemen do in the agricultural market?

"In 1876, the National Grange members explored coöperation in retailing goods and favored the ""Rochdale plan,"" developed by an English association, for coöperative stores. These stores were owned by various stockholders who each had an equal say in management. Goods were sold at regular prices, and profits were later divided among buyers based on their purchases. While this plan reduced fierce competition, it faced resistance from Midwestern farmers due to past coöperative failures. In other regions, like the East and South, the Rochdale plan found success. However, when the National Grange delved into manufacturing, problems arose. Attempting to control implement production, they faced challenges with large manufacturers. Despite setbacks, these ventures taught valuable lessons about business, cooperation, and the importance of mutual respect between farmers and manufacturers."|"1.

During the late 1800s, the Granger movement faced challenges as the Western farmers struggled with economic hardships. The farmers aimed to boost their profits by cutting transportation costs and eliminating middlemen but were unsuccessful. To address their financial woes, they sought to raise product prices and prevent debt appreciation by increasing the money supply. This desire for inflation had historical roots in American economic struggles, including during the Civil War when over $400,000,000 in greenbacks were issued, causing a decline in their value. The debate over currency inflation and bond redemption methods led to the rise of third parties advocating for greenbackism. Initially championed by labor unions in the East, greenbackism later gained traction among Western farmers as a solution to the economic downturn.|"1.

To address their financial woes, they sought to raise product prices and prevent debt appreciation by increasing the money supply. This desire for inflation had historical roots in American economic struggles, including during the Civil War when over $400,000,000 in greenbacks were issued, causing a decline in their value. The debate over currency inflation and bond redemption methods led to the rise of third parties advocating for greenbackism. Initially championed by labor unions in the East, greenbackism later gained traction among Western farmers as a solution to the economic downturn.|"6.

During the late 19th century, farmers faced financial hardships due to low crop prices, high mortgage interest rates, and unfair taxation. In 1888, 174 bushels of wheat were enough to cover the interest on a $2000 mortgage at 8%. However, by 1894, with wheat prices dropping, it took 320 bushels to pay the same interest. Many farmers fell into debt, unable to keep up with mortgage payments, leading to foreclosures. The tax system further burdened farmers, as they were taxed disproportionately compared to wealthier individuals and corporations. The farmers' distress led to discussions on remedies in various forums, emphasizing the need for more equitable financial policies. The control of money supply by Wall Street and national banks was criticized for exacerbating the farmers' plight.|"1.

In 1886, the Knights of Labor and trades unions worked together with the Greenbackers and farmers' groups, winning elections in parts of the U.S. Labor and farmers united, led by Henry George, James Buchanan, and Alson J. Streeter, but faced challenges. Streeter ran for President in 1888, getting votes mainly from Western states.

In 1886, the Knights of Labor and trades unions worked together with the Greenbackers and farmers' groups, winning elections in parts of the U.S. Labor and farmers united, led by Henry George, James Buchanan, and Alson J. Streeter, but faced challenges. Streeter ran for President in 1888, getting votes mainly from Western states. Farmers hesitated to join political actions, preferring non-political business organizations. Despite dissatisfaction, no new party was formed immediately. The St. Louis convention in 1889 highlighted demands for economic reforms, including greenbacks, free silver coinage, and government control of transportation. The sub-treasury scheme proposed by C. W. Macune aimed to help farmers by providing loans based on their crop values, increasing currency circulation and allowing farmers to hold crops for better prices. The Northwestern Alliance proposed a land loan bureau for low-interest loans on land. The political scene in 1890 saw debates on the sub-treasury scheme and the passage of the Silver Purchase Act, which partially satisfied the demands of Western farmers but left many feeling ignored.|"**5. What did the Silver Purchase Act partially satisfy in 1890?**

The Alliance adjusted its political actions to local needs. In several Southern States like Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, Alliance members influenced Democratic conventions. They ensured their demands were included in the party's agenda and pushed for candidates who supported these demands. This led to the control of legislatures in five Southern States by Alliance members or supporters. Additionally, three governors, a United States Senator, and forty-four Congressmen who backed Alliance principles were elected. In the West, the Alliance formed new parties rather than taking over existing ones. While not officially a political party, the Alliance played a crucial role in organizing People's, Independent, or Industrial parties across different States. This period marked a significant political and social transformation, particularly in Kansas, where the Alliance movement gained immense momentum. Meetings, lectures, and rallies were held to spread the Alliance's message, with prominent figures like Mary Elizabeth Lease advocating for economic reforms and criticizing the influence of money in politics.|"1.

"In July 1892, the Populist Party emerged in national politics at Omaha, where delegates from across the country gathered to nominate candidates for President and Vice-President and adopt a party platform. The platform, inspired by the Alliances' ""Demands,"" was described by critics as an impassioned critique of the era. It called for the unity of labor forces, wealth creation, and control of railroads by the people. Monetary reforms included a national currency, free coinage of silver and gold, and an increase in the circulating medium. The platform also demanded a graduated income tax, government ownership of essential services, and restrictions on alien land ownership. Despite initial enthusiasm, the nomination process for President was contentious, resulting in General James B. Weaver and General James G. Field being selected as the party's candidates.

In the 1892 election, the Populist party made a strong impact by garnering over a million votes, nearly nine percent of the total.

In the 1892 election, the Populist party made a strong impact by garnering over a million votes, nearly nine percent of the total. This achievement set a record for a third party in its second year, surpassed only by the Republican party in 1856. General Weaver, a Populist leader, declared that the Republicans were declining rapidly, while the Populists were gearing up for a robust campaign to educate and organize supporters across the nation. Despite some criticism about aligning with older parties through fusion, many believed that 1892 marked a significant milestone for the Populist movement. The campaign lessons learned paved the way for a more independent stance in future elections, aiming to win over Democratic and Republican voters through ideological conversion rather than party alliances. The Populist cause focused on advocating for free silver coinage, government-issued paper money, and opposition to interest-bearing bonds controlled by private banking interests.|"6. What were some of the key focuses of the Populist cause?

B) Supporting interest-bearing bonds

In 1873, the Act was debated in Congress for four sessions. Initially, there was no opposition to making gold the sole standard of value or omitting the silver dollar. However, the value of silver rapidly declined, causing a stir. Bimetallists blamed monetary changes, while gold standard supporters attributed it to increased silver production. This decline led to demands for remonetization by Western states reliant on silver mining. The Bland-Allison Act of 1878 restored the silver dollar but was unsatisfactory to free silver advocates. The silver coinage issue continued to divide political parties until 1890 when the Silver Purchase Act was passed. This act aimed to stabilize silver prices but failed, contributing to the Panic of 1893. The silver question became a national debate, impacting the economy significantly.|"1.

"From coast to coast, the nation was inundated with contentious literature, designed to appeal to those without the time or expertise to grasp the complex economic issues at hand. W. H. Harvey's ""Coin's Financial School"" stood out as the most widely read piece, alongside numerous other pamphlets and books that reached a vast audience.

In 1893, Kansas was at the center of national politics due to a dispute over the control of the lower house of the legislature. The Republicans had a majority, but some seats were contested for suspected fraud. The Populists could outnumber the Republicans if these seats were disqualified.

The tumultuous session lasted over two weeks, with men from all over the state converging on Topeka. Eventually, the Populist house withdrew, leaving the Republicans in control. The standoff led to absurd and serious measures, with the involvement of the judiciary and militia. The struggle ended with the Republicans in the house and the Populists in the senate, prompting joint efforts for the silver cause.

The Democratic convention in Chicago three weeks later was far from straightforward. Despite some Northeastern States supporting the gold standard, the West and free silver held the upper hand. Senator John W. Daniel of Virginia, a strong silver advocate, was chosen over the nominee for temporary chairman. The second day saw territories tripling their representation, gold-supporting delegations were replaced by silver supporters, and Senator Stephen M. White of California was made permanent chairman. The platform, mainly about money, sparked heated debates. The committee on resolutions rejected monometallism, calling it a British policy that harmed industrial prosperity. A minority proposed amendments supporting a gold standard and praising Grover Cleveland. William Jennings Bryan emerged as a leader, voicing the silver cause passionately. Bryan, a young man from Nebraska, had already made a mark in politics with his oratory skills and advocacy for free silver.|"1.

Figures like William Saunders, the founder of the Grange, and Carl Schurz, who championed civil service reform, left their mark. The issue of silver coinage was a hot topic, with the agrarian demand for free silver leading to debates and the Silver Purchase Act. Individuals like ""Sockless"" Jerry Simpson and A. S. Sloan were key players in these movements. The Southern states, particularly South Carolina and South Dakota, saw political shifts with the rise of the Populist party. The Supreme Court also played a crucial role in various cases related to railroad laws and rate regulations. Tariff policies and taxation were central issues, with the demand for reform echoing across the nation. Figures like W. R. Taylor and Benjamin Tillman left their mark on the political landscape. The fight against trusts and the push for anti-trust legislation marked a significant turn in economic policies."|"6.
