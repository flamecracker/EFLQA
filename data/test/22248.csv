Manabozho wanted to try hunting after devouring all the game near his lodge. While walking by a lake, he met a magician wolf and his young ones. The old wolf used his magic to make a moose disappear before Manabozho could eat. The wolves then went hunting, leaving Manabozho alone. He tried to eat a piece of moose but got distracted by a creaking tree. As he climbed the tree to investigate, his paw got stuck.

As the winter neared its end and spring approached, the wise old wolf bid farewell to Manabozho.

Once upon a time, Manabozho, a brave hunter, embarked on a spiritual journey. He chanted a peculiar song, then fasted in a cave facing the setting sun for seven days.
