Slowly, cautiously moving forward, he carefully navigated the terrain. He had ample time for contemplation.

The person turned his gaze. Close to the boat, a lush island emerged from the sea. A beautiful meadow stretched out before him, so near that he could almost touch the grass from the boat. Perplexed, he pondered where it had been before and how he stumbled upon it so suddenly. In the distance, a crowd of ordinary people, men, women, and children, dressed in unfamiliar simple attire, faced a small group of men with a central figure in white clothing. A boy presented something in a basket. The person observed in astonishment and reverence, feeling a peculiar calm within. The white-clad figure took out a rough loaf of bread from the basket, raised it skyward, murmured words, broke the bread, and shared it. The island vanished abruptly as the scene shifted. Now, he peered into a dimly lit room with peculiar lamps, seeing stars through an open window. The men from the meadow were alone with the central figure in the upper chamber, reclining around a table. The figure lifted a silver cup from the table, blessed it, and offered it. The sailor opened the last bread bag, finding a small overlooked crumb. Remembering his past as a chorister, he recited powerful words and leaned over the woman.|"1.
