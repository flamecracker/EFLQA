Mr. Parasyte was one of these individuals, despite being an excellent teacher. He was visibly frustrated when he realized I was determined and unwilling to back down. Storming out of the room in a fit of anger, he was clearly not in the right frame of mind for the religious activities that followed. As darkness enveloped the room, I lay on the bed, reflecting on the events of the day and contemplating the consequences of my actions. I longed for guidance from a caring friend, a father, or a loving mother. Despite feeling right about my decisions, I was left wondering why Mr. Parasyte was detaining me in the Institute after expelling me. The students, led by Bob Hale, eventually broke down the door to free me, initiating a student-led tribunal to address the situation.

I was concerned that I had been stubborn and disobedient, but I felt justified in not apologizing regarding Poodles. Overall, I was content with myself, although I recognized that I may have gone too far in some instances. I resumed rowing towards the bluff. My route took me close to the shore until I passed the northern point of Parkville, where the steamboat dock juts out into the deep lake water. Continuing past this pier, I caught sight of the Parkville Liberal Institute. Despite it being mid-morning, I was surprised to see numerous students outside the buildings near the lake, not engaging in their usual activities but gathered in groups.

I found the Splash boat and was thrilled to see it raised, nearly good as new. The wheelwright confirmed it was not severely damaged.

The long painter of the scow had been extended and fastened to the three boats. With a fresh wind blowing, I took the lead, attached a rope to the painter, and the boats set off, pulling the scow along.

My friends and I were taken aback by his sudden move. Mr. Greene, the deputy sheriff, assured us that he would handle Thornton's case judiciously. Realizing the futility of his presence at Camp Fair Play, Mr. Parasyte left with Mr. Greene. Despite his intellect, Mr. Parasyte's tyrannical nature overshadowed his teaching abilities.

We arrived at Pine Island with supplies and swiftly sailed to Cleaver Island under the moonlight. As we neared the shore, I noticed a row-boat approaching, which I suspected belonged to Mr. Parasyte. To give them a fright, I steered our boat towards them, causing them to panic and plead for safety. Despite their scare, I navigated past them. Meanwhile, Pearl, a new member, agreed to wait for Vallington's approval to join our camp. After our return, we found the camp packed up and ready for departure to Pine Island.

The group of traitors had taken the Splash, and possibly a few rowboats, to Cannondale, which was just two miles southeast of Pine Island. The prevailing northwest wind made the journey easy.

The wind was strong, making it impossible to return to the island. Upon reaching Cannondale, they found the boats and a man who had helped the deserters.

The wind was strong, making it impossible to return to the island. Upon reaching Cannondale, they found the boats and a man who had helped the deserters. The man explained how he found the boats on the beach and brought them to the steamboat wharf for safety. The boys claimed possession of their boats, avoiding a quarrel with the man.|"2.

It was useless to argue, so I cut the rope, setting the row-boat adrift. The boat struggled in the rough waters. I circled back, tossed a bucket to Pearl, and helped him bail out the water. Despite the situation, Pearl remained calm. We rescued Mr. Parasyte, who seemed ungrateful. As we sailed back, Mr. Parasyte unexpectedly accused us, misinterpreting a smile. Though we saved his life, he showed no gratitude. Bob and I were disappointed. We decided to search for the flat-boat, planning to return to our group later. The company gathered, surprised by the events. A council was held to discuss our next steps, but we left the decision to our leader, who promised to act wisely based on circumstances.|"1.

Our group vowed to follow these instructions precisely and be prepared for any orders given. The boat docked at the simple pier and tied to a tree. We observed closely the actions of the people who disembarked from the boat. Following Mr. Parasyte's unkind behavior, it became clear that the rebellion was more serious than we thought. We, along with Bob Hale, decided that reconciliation with him was impossible. The situation had escalated, and what began as a prank seemed to be turning into a serious matter. While the boys initially talked seriously about their rights and taking a stand, they didn't grasp the gravity of their actions. I won't justify everything the boys did, but I believe the school principal was unfit to guide and discipline young men. He was unjust, a hidden tyrant, close-minded, and not a good example of a teacher. If the boys were wrong, he was even more so, given his influence and position. The situation was becoming more serious as Mr. Parasyte arrived with men to accomplish something unknown to us. We wondered if we would be forced onto the Adieno or if there was a different plan. Mr. Parasyte and his group landed, some carrying sticks and ropes, hinting at possible force. We were uncertain if Vallington would fight or flee. Although we lacked weapons, a pile of sticks nearby caught our attention. When Mr. Parasyte's group arrived, the boat-keeper removed the plank, but it|"1.

My heart raced with excitement as we embarked on our daring adventure, and I admired Henry Vallington's unexpected bravery. He seemed more like a fearless leader than a future clergyman. As my words echoed among the boys on deck, Vallington swiftly headed to the engine room. The sound of steam filled the air, and I anxiously awaited the outcome, unsure if disaster loomed. Suddenly, the wheels splashed into action, and the Adieno lurched forward, sending a surge of exhilaration through me. Luckily, the steamer was positioned favorably at the pier, requiring minimal skill to navigate. Although I lacked experience, I observed the steersman closely on previous trips. With trembling hands, I grasped the wheel, aligning the flagstaff and pier end to guide me. Slowly gaining confidence, I steered the vessel away from shore, the paddles churning the water. Despite my nervousness, I managed to stop the boat and signal for it to move forward. Vallington emerged, looking exhausted but determined. Together, we faced the uncertain future, leaving the bewildered adults on the pier behind.|"1. What was the initial reaction of the speaker as they embarked on the adventure?
