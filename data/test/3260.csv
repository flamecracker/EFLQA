The migration is ongoing. Explore the history of an upland Welsh parish, and you'll discover that old families, high and low, have made way for newcomers in a remarkably short time. Trace the trains transporting emigrants from Hull or London to Liverpool heading west—they resemble the blue-eyed, yellow-haired arrivals from two thousand years ago. However, America has now become their new destination. Periodically, the Welsh feel the urge to wander due to food scarcity, population density, oppression, or a desire for freedom. Hunger and a vivid imagination prompted groups of adventurers to seek new lands. This cycle of exploration and renewal is how every nation rejuvenates itself. Rome, for instance, emphasized the need for order and law alongside adventure. The memory of Rome's influence lingered in Wales, notably through a significant battle fought near the Berwyn. Caratacus led the Britons in a fierce battle against the Romans, ultimately surrendering and being paraded in Rome. The battle stirred the Silures to intensify their resistance, prolonging Roman conquest efforts. Agricola's arrival brought wisdom and Roman peace, leading to the construction of towns, roads, and the flourishing of agriculture and mining in Wales.|"1.

In the past, Wales was governed by two main principles: a desire for order and a yearning for independence. The risk of too much order was the possibility of oppression, while too much independence could lead to chaos and weakness. At times, Wales was united under leaders like Maelgwn or Rhodri, with other local princes ruling independently.

Although it was ideal to have one king ruling the entire country, Wales was mostly divided into smaller kingdoms like Gwynedd, Powys, Ceredigion, Deheubarth, Dyved, Morgannwg, and Gwent. Each kingdom had its own unique characteristics and laws. The social structure in Wales included free high-born individuals and lower-born serfs, with opportunities for social mobility over time.

Between 1277 and 1282, there was a significant conflict. The Welsh people rebelled against new rulers, seeking protection from Llywelyn, especially his brother David. Despite efforts by Eleanor, Llywelyn's wife, and Edward's cousin, to maintain peace, she passed away during preparations for the final war in 1282. Edward faced challenges in conquering Powys or Deheubarth due to the impregnable nature of Gwynedd. The mountainous region of Snowdon served as a natural barrier, making it difficult for invaders to penetrate. Edward needed a substantial army and financial resources to confront Llywelyn's forces. Eventually, Edward's army surrounded Snowdon, forcing Llywelyn's allies to surrender or flee. Llywelyn's death in a skirmish led to the Welsh losing faith and ultimately surrendering to Edward. The conflict was not solely between England and Wales, as Welsh soldiers fought on both sides. Despite differing views, both Edward and Llywelyn believed they were justified in their actions. Today, Wales enjoys freedom within a united Britain, reflecting the historical complexities of this conflict.|"5. What event led to the Welsh losing faith and surrendering to Edward?

In ancient times, Wales was considered more civilized than England. While Welsh law was simpler than English law, it was often fairer and more humane. In Wales, land ownership was more equal, giving all sons an equal chance. Additionally, in cases of crime, the punishment was often more merciful compared to the brutal practices in England. For instance, during the reign of John and Edward I, Welsh hostages faced cruel fates for their fathers' actions. The Welsh rulers, like Griffith ap Conan and Llywelyn the Great, were energetic and far-sighted leaders, akin to Henry II. Their characters were often more endearing than many English kings. Despite the conquest of Wales by English kings, the Welsh language and culture persisted, showing signs of a rich civilization. Wales was divided into shires by English rulers, but the old Welsh laws and customs endured. The Norman-conquered Wales in the east and south had its own unique laws and ruling families, subject to the English king but often acting as independent lords. Llywelyn, the last independent Welsh prince, marked the end of an era, with the title of Prince of Wales passing to the English crown. The current Prince of Wales descends from the ancient House of Cunedda, linking back to the earliest Welsh royal lineage.|"1.

Warfare has two sides: attack and defense. The constant development of new methods for both attack and defense leads to significant changes in the world. When defense strategies are superior to attack strategies, little change occurs as the strong can maintain their gains. Conversely, when attacking methods are more advanced, new opportunities arise, sparking numerous transformations. Castles were the primary defense structures, while the long-bow was a key weapon for attacks. Wales boasts exemplary castles and is renowned for the long-bow. From 1066 to 1284, England and Wales were conquered and fortified with castles. Subsequently, from 1284 to 1461, England and Wales used the long-bow to launch successful attacks. Various strategies emerged for storming castles, including scaling walls with ladders, using mangonels to hurl stones, and mining to breach walls. To counter mining, defenders dug moats, built brattices, and constructed stronger towers. The Edwardian castles, like Caerphilly, featured concentric designs with multiple layers of defense. These castles were vital in Edward's efforts to control Wales.|"1. What were the two sides of warfare mentioned in the text?

There were two main types of bows used in warfare: the cross-bow and the long-bow. The cross-bow was initially designed for defending towns and required strength and precision. It had a mechanism to draw the string back along a wooden piece, allowing the archer to take aim carefully. In contrast, the long-bow was a simple yet powerful weapon made of sinewy yew and a string. It required instant aim and was drawn to the ear, making it deadly in battle. The long-bow was instrumental in breaking the lines of the Snowdon lances and pikes during the Welsh wars and later proved effective against the nobles of France. Additionally, the decline in the value of money and the rise of towns and commerce played significant roles in transforming the economic and social landscape during this period.|"1.

The Norman and English Conquests boosted trade, leading to the rise of towns with established markets. Barons protected merchants in exchange for tolls, fostering a thriving trade environment. Every baron had a castle, necessitating walled towns that relied on trade for survival. In these towns, individuals were judged based on their skills rather than their social status. The Church condemned serfdom, advocating for freedom. The Black Death pandemic drastically reduced the labor force, empowering laborers to demand higher wages. This led to conflicts between laborers and lords, resulting in revolts like the Peasant Revolt in England and Owen Glendower’s rebellion in Wales. Ultimately, with the demise of Owen of Wales in 1378, the era of rebellions against the English monarchy in Wales concluded.|"1. What impact did the Norman and English Conquests have on trade?

The Welsh Bible by William Morgan in 1588, supported by Archbishop Whitgift, marked a significant moment welcoming the Reformation. However, the Reformation's impact was not as profound in Wales as in England. The Tudors, like Elizabeth, favored the people over nobles, fostering harmony between Crown and Parliament.

During the two centuries of apparent settlement and sleep, a silent revolution took place in Wales. This period was more significant in understanding the present than the past battles of the House of Cunedda. The history of Wales shifted from focusing on princes and nobles to the people themselves. Owen Glendower's brief rule was seen as a prophecy, hinting at a change in the air. The transition from a privileged class to a self-reliant peasantry was gradual but transformative. The evolution of Welsh literature mirrored these changes, from the grandeur of the princes to the emergence of a new poetic philosophy among the people. The rise of the Welsh peasant was marked by writers like Rees Prichard, Williams Pant y Celyn, and Islwyn, each representing different centuries and styles. The shift in Welsh literature reflected broader societal changes driven by factors like the long-bow, gunpowder, ideas of equality, industry, and commerce.|"1.

In 1885, the third Reform Act marked a significant shift in the political landscape, particularly in Wales. The Act disenfranchised rural districts like Brecon, Cardigan, Pembroke, and Anglesey while granting additional representation to industrial areas like Carnarvonshire, Swansea, Carmarthenshire, Monmouthshire, and Glamorgan. This change empowered agricultural laborers and artisans, altering the traditional power dynamics. Wales evolved from blindly following the gentry to becoming the most democratic part of Britain. The Sunday School system, established before 1814, played a vital role in educating the masses, with dedicated teachers and a rigorous curriculum.

The history of secondary education in Wales dates back to the dissolution of monasteries. Endowed schools, like the Friars at Bangor, and proprietary schools served this purpose. The Education Act of 1889 established a system of secondary schools under popular control. Notable schools include Brecon and Llandovery. These schools were initially founded for religious ministry and were later expanded to include colleges in various districts. Higher education in Wales had been a long-standing dream, with attempts dating back to Owen Glendower. The University College of Wales in Aberystwyth opened in 1872, followed by colleges in Cardiff and Bangor. The University of Wales was formed in 1893. The educational system in Wales aims for greater unity, with efforts to integrate secondary schools and colleges under one efficient and patriotic University.|"1.

The Local Government Acts that followed the Reform Acts were more crucial to Wales. When the Reform Act of 1884 granted agricultural laborers the right to vote, all interests were represented in Parliament. Further expanding the franchise wouldn't change party dynamics, as thought by the British Parliament, too busy to consider sentiment. The complexity of interests made it hard to address them effectively. This led to a shift towards local government expansion. Wales lacked local governance and needed it the most. The County Council Act of 1888 and the Local Government Act of 1894 were pivotal. Welsh local councils were warmly embraced, filling a void. Trained men from various institutions became councillors, bringing skill and tact to governance. The councils faced challenges but made significant strides in education and welfare. Today, Wales stands united and self-reliant, with local councils playing a vital role in its progress.|"1. What was the main reason for the shift towards local government expansion in Wales?
