When Curdie and Lina reached the hall, it was quiet and dimly lit. The remnants of a once-great fire cast a faint red glow, but provided little light. Feeling the chill of the cellar, Curdie stood by the dying fire to warm himself briefly. He noticed several candlesticks on the supper table but found that all the candles had been left to burn out, some still hot at the neck. As he searched for bits of candle, he discovered seven men asleep in various places, seemingly in a deep slumber from excessive eating and drinking. Curdie even found unusual items like ox hoofs, pig hoofs, and a dog's paw among them. Disgusted by the state of the palace, Curdie continued his search for candles, eventually finding a few pieces. They then left the hall and entered a dark, smoky kitchen, illuminated by a dwindling fire, revealing the chaotic and dirty surroundings. The scene saddened Curdie, thinking about the princess living in such unpleasant conditions. He moved on to the sculleries, where he encountered more filth and disorder, with mangy dogs and rats scavenging around. The foul smells and sights made him long for his mother's clean kitchen. Finally, they proceeded to a grand corridor with sleeping men in royal attire, giving off an air of foolishness. Lina seemed ready to pounce on them. They ascended a staircase, leaving behind the squalor of the lower quarters.|"1. What did Curdie notice on the supper table in the hall?

Curdie explored a rich yet soft environment, with ancient fortress remnants scattered about. As he and Lina, his companion, wandered, they found themselves repeatedly in familiar spots. Gradually, Curdie began to grasp the layout. Lina grew increasingly fearful, hinting at the presence of someone nearby.
