We entered the drawing-room where the lady of the house sat at a delicate writing-table, engrossed in a letter. She was shortsighted, like most others in the room, who were focused on intricate needlework. Our hostess greeted us kindly, inquired about our journey, then returned to her letter.

The atmosphere shifted when the hostess seemed agitated, and the Irishman's playful demeanor changed. The red-haired lady then whisked us away to the yellow room, where our box awaited, but the key was forgotten.

Miss Lucy, a sharp young lady, hosted us in the schoolroom, where she talked about a recent wedding and her dresses. She was warm and chatty with us but distant in the company of older guests.

Cecilia and the major were in Bath, and their letters were read aloud at breakfast. The ladies were deeply interested in Cecilia's letters about fashions, drives, and the pump-room, even though they had no connection to the people and places mentioned. When a familiar name was recognized, it was like finding a treasure. Miss Lucy followed the letters closely, remembering details despite never having been to Bath or knowing the people mentioned. Remembering family connections and past events was seen as a useful skill, demanding attention and time. Later, in a private moment with their hostess, the girls listened attentively as she shared stories about Cecilia and the major, military exploits, and family history. The hostess introduced them as daughters of a dear friend, and the girls were invited to spend the night together to continue hearing about Cecilia's life and the proposal story.|"6.

Miss Lucy shared tales of school drama, where two sisters despised each other but had to dress alike.

She mentioned her cousin's romantic elopement to Gretna Green with a handsome officer, leading to quarrels and his departure. Miss Lucy's frivolous talk on serious matters showed her lack of understanding. She chattered about family trees, boasting of royal descent from King Stephen. Her gossipy nature and shallow knowledge amused but also irked her peers.|"1. What did Miss Lucy share tales about?

Sunday was a day of mixed experiences for us. Miss Lucy, dressed in her best clothes, was overly patronizing, and a general stiffness filled the air, even affecting the ladies' silk dresses. After a leisurely breakfast, we hurried to get ready for church. Miss Lucy lost her Prayer Book, causing a delay. Finally, we all squeezed into the carriages and rushed to the quaint church. Unfortunately, we were late, missing the bells. Inside, the congregation's behavior varied. Some knelt during prayers, while others sat. The red-haired young lady knelt, and we followed suit. Responses were diverse, with one man standing and responding loudly. During the sermon, our hostess drew the curtains around our pew. I noticed an old gentleman facing the pulpit with intense focus. Later, I saw the red-haired young lady and an Irishman leaving for church together, leaving me puzzled about their interaction.|"1. What caused a delay before going to church?

I recall that stroll vividly, Ida! It was a warm, delightful summer afternoon—the dusty plants along the path, the clematis in the hedges (I tucked a piece into my Prayer Book, where it stayed for years)—the grasshoppers and flies our dresses picked up from the tall grass, only to reappear as we sat through the sermon. The elderly gentleman was in his pew, his gaze almost kindly, as we took our seats in due time. We enthusiastically followed his lead in the responses; even the Irishman rejected compromises. During prayers, if he glanced over at our pew (which he could hardly avoid), he must have noticed our unity. A hymn followed the sermon, a tradition of the church to conclude Evening Prayer. It was Bishop Ken's evening hymn, well-known to all. The highlight was the Irishman's unexpected singing voice, clear and moving, distinct from the schoolchildren's and the fiddle's sounds. Despite the less satisfying evening that followed, the hymn sung by the Irishman remained a memorable moment from that day.|"1.

Dear Ida, it's vital for young ladies like you, at the age of thirteen, to not disregard the importance of dressing nicely and having good manners.

Miss Lucy began a chilling tale from years ago about an old man named Mr. Bartlett and his daughter who fell in love with a man of inferior family. The daughter's father threatened to disinherit her if she married him. The man, driven by greed, murdered Mr. Bartlett but couldn't escape the haunting presence of the old man's ghost.

The story lingered in the minds of the listeners until they were distracted by the arrival of unexpected guests, Cecilia and the major. The guests turned out to be quite different from what was expected, with Cecilia appearing gentle and the major proving to be kind and sensible. As the night wore on, the ghostly tale resurfaced, causing fear and unease among the listeners, especially when mysterious sounds were heard.|"1.

Fatima was unable to speak any longer. In the moonlight filtering through the blinds, I hurriedly got up, assisting her out of bed and across the room. The hardest part was opening the door at such a moment. We fumbled our way down the passage, feeling for the door handles. As we entered the room, bathed in moonlight, we saw a chair draped in white, a muslin dress, black satin shoes, and delicate ornaments. In the bed lay our friend Kate, fast asleep, her red hair cascading over the pillow. I climbed up and gently woke her, explaining our predicament. Kate, sympathetic but sleepy, allowed us to join her in bed. Despite the earlier ghostly fright, we found comfort and soon fell asleep, holding onto her hair for reassurance. The next morning, the fear seemed distant, and we shared a light-hearted breakfast, with the Irishman playfully teasing us about the night's events.|"1.

Even the modest bookshelf in the inn's parlour became a source of fascination, offering me a glimpse into a world of stories and adventures.

Even the modest bookshelf in the inn's parlour became a source of fascination, offering me a glimpse into a world of stories and adventures. In an era where illustrated storybooks were a rarity, the simple engravings in the book I chose captivated me, blending entertainment with valuable lessons. The experience of that day, filled with new discoveries and moments of rest, left me with cherished memories and a deep appreciation for the simple joys of life.|"4.

As I grew older, the fanciful ideas I had about my father faded, but my unique fondness for him only grew. Our bond deepened as we shared harmonious tastes and understood each other well. Unlike Fatima, who sometimes struggled to connect with him, I found comfort in his refined manners and considerate nature. My father believed in practicing good manners at home, a principle he often emphasized. He encouraged us to treat our family members with the utmost courtesy and respect, setting a high standard for our behavior.

Mary, my father and I were drawn to Reka Dom for various reasons. The garden, with its three lush lawns divided by sweet-smelling hedges, felt like a magical realm. The swing between the elm trees on the second lawn delighted me until it broke, but that didn't stop me from exploring further.

My father, a lover of languages, was intrigued by the Russian name of the house and the traces of a foreign language. He also appreciated the spacious grounds where he could wander undisturbed. The old housekeeper shared stories of the former English tenants with a Russian connection, adding to the mystique of Reka Dom.|"1.
