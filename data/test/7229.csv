I fear a mutiny might happen, and that Miss Hannay will need protection, while I might be around to help.""

Half the men were to remain there on guard, while the others would continue with the servants to make journeys backwards and forwards to the bungalows, bringing in as much as could be carried, the guard to be changed every hour. In the morning the servants were all to have the choice given them of remaining with their masters or leaving.

"Despite the medicines given by the Doctor and the cold water splashed on him, Bathurst took some time to wake up. When he saw Mrs. Hunter and the Doctor next to him, he tried to sit up. ""No, I didn't. I wasn't trying to risk my life,"" Bathurst explained. ""I was trying to face gunfire. Bullets don't scare me, Doctor; it's the loud noise that I can't handle."" The Doctor understood, ""It's the same thing, my boy. You exposed yourself to danger needlessly. You were lucky to escape unhurt. You need to rest now. Mrs. Hunter will look after you. There's no need for you to be on the roof right now."" The Doctor explained to the ladies that Bathurst's fear of gunfire was a personal issue, not a lack of courage.
