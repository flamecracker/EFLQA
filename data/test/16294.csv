In 1606, England claimed land in North America for two companies. The London Company was to establish the First Colony between 34 and 41 degrees latitude, and the Plymouth Company the Second Colony between 38 and 45 degrees. The colonists had limited rights, subject to the king's rule. The companies financed the ventures but had limited rewards. The colonists faced harsh conditions, and many returned to England. In 1607, the Plymouth Company sent settlers to Maine, but they faced a harsh winter and lack of resources. The colony was abandoned, with most settlers returning to England due to discouragement. This marked the end of the northern colony on the Sagadahoc River.|"6. What led to the end of the northern colony on the Sagadahoc River?

The Chesapeake Bay Indians believed in many devils that required powwows and conjurations for protection. Captain Smith described a conjuration he witnessed in 1607, where he was seated by a fire and surrounded by priests chanting and rattling gourds. Another custom involved adopting captives to spare them from torture, as seen when Powhatan's daughter, Pocahontas, saved Smith's life by interceding for him. Despite some skepticism about Smith's accounts, similar incidents in Indian culture support the credibility of his experiences. Additionally, Smith observed the Indians' leisure activities, such as singing, dancing, and playing music with pipes and gourds.

Five days after Newport's arrival at Jamestown, a fire destroyed most of the fort's buildings. This tragedy, combined with a harsh winter, led to many settlers dying from exposure while trying to rebuild. The famine added to their struggles, but Captain Newport helped by bringing supplies from Powhatan in February. Despite his stay of over three months, conditions did not improve.

In the early 1600s, Virginia faced harsh challenges. Despite efforts to prevent diseases, over 150 people succumbed to fever during the summer. Settlers dwindled to under 200, prompting consolidation at Jamestown and Algernourne fort. Lord Delaware, the leader, fell ill, leaving the colony in a dire state with only three months of supplies. Successive deputy governors, like Sir Thomas Dale, ruled with a heavy hand, focusing on profit over settlers' welfare. Dale enforced harsh labor conditions, treating men like slaves and resorting to extreme punishments. However, his tough tactics subdued local Native American tribes and even led to the marriage of Pocahontas to John Rolfe, fostering peace. Dale's expeditions extended beyond Virginia, clashing with French and Dutch settlements.

It was fortunate that Yardley took over the supervision of Virginia affairs in England. Sir Thomas Smith had been in charge but was too busy with other companies. A quarrel with Lord Rich led to a new treasurer being elected, Sir Edwin Sandys. Sandys worked hard, sending ships with emigrants and cattle to Virginia. King James interfered with the company's choice of treasurer due to political reasons. The earl of Southampton replaced Sandys. Despite some political unrest, Virginia prospered.

Since 1614, when Pocahontas married John Rolfe, peace with the Indians remained unbroken, except for a brief conflict in 1617, swiftly quelled by Deputy Governor Yardley. In April 1618, Powhatan passed away, and his brother Opechancanough took charge.

The removal of the royal governor was a bold move that surprised King Charles. He viewed it as an abuse of his authority and had the two daring burgesses arrested.

Tobacco laws over the next decade aimed to halt further decreases. The price of tobacco ranged from one penny to sixpence, causing much uncertainty as it was the main currency. In 1640, a law ordered the destruction of bad tobacco and half of the good, estimating that eight thousand people placed one million five hundred thousand pounds of tobacco on the market. The drop in tobacco prices led planters to focus on other industries, like supplying corn to the large influx of English settlers in Massachusetts.

On April 18, 1644, Governor Berkeley declared Good Friday a fast day to pray for King Charles, but it turned into a day of tragedy. Opechancanough, the leader of the Powhatan Confederacy, attacked the settlers, resulting in over 300 deaths. The colony was shaken to its core by this massacre. However, Berkeley's response was delayed, and he left the colony for a year. Upon his return, he captured Opechancanough, who was later killed. Peace was eventually restored with the Indians.

Around 1648, Virginia flourished with the gospel spreading, attracting civil, honorable, and wealthy individuals. Orchards bloomed, grand buildings rose, and trades thrived. Despite a tumultuous past with massacres, the land transformed into a place of joy and abundance. Following King Charles's execution in 1649, royalists flooded Virginia, elevating society's quality and strengthening support for the monarch. Parliament responded by imposing trade restrictions on rebellious colonies, including Virginia, in 1650. The first navigation act in 1651 directed colonial trade solely to England, barring Dutch vessels. A squadron led by Captain Robert Dennis aimed to subdue Virginia. Upon arrival in January 1652, an agreement was reached between Virginians and commissioners, recognizing English authority. Virginia enjoyed self-governance under the Commonwealth of England for eight years, initiating a new era of prosperity and autonomy.|"1.

In the southern part of the colony, plantations stretched along watercourses leading to creeks and rivers that were tributaries of the James River. Some adventurous individuals even explored into North Carolina. To the west, the plantations extended predominantly along the James River, reaching as far as the Falls where Richmond stands today. The population was estimated at around twenty thousand, with about five thousand white servants and five hundred African American slaves. Houses were typically made of wood, one and a half stories high, with brick chimneys. Wealthier residents lived in homes entirely constructed from homemade bricks. The colony was characterized by good English furniture and a considerable amount of silverware. The people were content with their new homes, and thefts were rare. Hospitality was widespread, and the opening of the forests contributed to the overall health of the region. The absence of towns in Virginia was attributed to the abundance of waterways allowing planters to ship their goods from personal wharves and the dispersed nature of tobacco cultivation. This rural lifestyle fostered independence among the population and led to a democratic society. Education was present in the form of parish institutions, with ministers running schools and the county courts overseeing educational welfare, particularly for orphans. The establishment of free schools through legacies in various counties further contributed to education in the colony. George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore, played a significant role in the founding of Maryland after exploring colonization plans in America and obtaining a charter for his province named Avalon.|"1.

In 1627, Lord Baltimore and his family traveled to Newfoundland to pursue his colonization plans. However, the cold climate led him to seek a warmer location. By August 1629, he requested land in Virginia from the king. He quickly left Newfoundland and arrived in Virginia in October 1629, where he faced a cool reception from the governor and council. They were unimpressed by his religion, past as a court favorite, and plans to establish an independent state within Virginia. The council required him to take oaths of allegiance and supremacy, the latter being unacceptable to him due to his Catholic beliefs. Lord Baltimore sailed back to England to appeal directly to the king. Despite official promises not to disrupt existing interests, the king granted a province to Sir Robert Heath in southern Virginia. Baltimore petitioned for land in Virginia, leading to a charter being prepared in February 1631, but it was delayed by William Claiborne, a Virginia council member. Claiborne, a prominent figure in Virginia, opposed Baltimore's efforts and successfully blocked the grant. Baltimore persisted and eventually received a patent for a portion of Virginia, which he named Terra Mariæ or Maryland in honor of Henrietta Maria, the king's wife. George Calvert, also known as Lord Baltimore, passed away in April 1632, and the charter was issued to his son Cecilius, who would go on to govern Maryland with skill and prudence.|"1.

They were unimpressed by his religion, past as a court favorite, and plans to establish an independent state within Virginia. The council required him to take oaths of allegiance and supremacy, the latter being unacceptable to him due to his Catholic beliefs. Lord Baltimore sailed back to England to appeal directly to the king. Despite official promises not to disrupt existing interests, the king granted a province to Sir Robert Heath in southern Virginia. Baltimore petitioned for land in Virginia, leading to a charter being prepared in February 1631, but it was delayed by William Claiborne, a Virginia council member. Claiborne, a prominent figure in Virginia, opposed Baltimore's efforts and successfully blocked the grant. Baltimore persisted and eventually received a patent for a portion of Virginia, which he named Terra Mariæ or Maryland in honor of Henrietta Maria, the king's wife. George Calvert, also known as Lord Baltimore, passed away in April 1632, and the charter was issued to his son Cecilius, who would go on to govern Maryland with skill and prudence.|"2.

In 1633, Lord Baltimore faced opposition from the Virginia Company and planters in Virginia, led by Claiborne. The matter was referred to the Commissioners for Foreign Plantations, who ruled in favor of Baltimore's patent, allowing him to proceed with his settlement. Baltimore's charter granted him a palatinate government akin to Durham in England, affording him significant autonomy. Unlike the bishop of Durham, Baltimore did not pay taxes to the British treasury. His colony was founded on principles of religious tolerance, allowing for the establishment of churches of various denominations. In October 1633, Baltimore's ships, the _Ark_ and the _Dove_, set sail for America with a diverse group of settlers, including Catholics and Protestants.

On February 27, 1634, the settlers landed at Point Comfort, where a letter from the king to Sir John Harvey ensured a warm welcome. Here, they discovered that local Native Americans were alarmed, mistaking them for Spaniards intending to conquer their land. After a brief stop for supplies, they sailed up Chesapeake Bay and entered the Potomac River, which dwarfed the Thames in comparison. Natives armed themselves at the river's mouth, and fires lit up the land at night. On March 25, they landed on St. Clement's Island, planted a cross, and then explored the area. The settlers established St. Mary's on March 27, 1634. Unlike Virginia, Maryland thrived due to individual property ownership, a mix of gentlemen and laborers, proximity to Virginia for resources, and access to land cleared by Native Americans. They quickly grew corn, traded with New England, and began cultivating tobacco, leading to the importation of servants who later became freemen. Maryland's society resembled Virginia's, with a focus on agriculture and rural life. The lord proprietor's powers created an aristocracy, with a council and manorial courts similar to those in Durham, England.|"1. What did the settlers discover upon landing at Point Comfort?

In the early days of Maryland, Lord Baltimore sought regal dignity through his right to enact laws and shape the assembly. However, the New World's ethos of political and social equality led to a government of the people. The assembly, starting in 1635, asserted its autonomy by drafting laws Lord Baltimore rejected. Eventually, in 1638, he conceded to the assembly's laws until his confirmation. Subsequent assemblies, from 1639 to 1642, limited seats to councillors, specially summoned persons, and elected burgesses. Despite Lord Baltimore's attempts to impose laws, the assembly rejected his complex code in 1649, crafting their own. By 1650, Maryland established a constitutional system mirroring Virginia's, with a two-chamber assembly. The delay in Maryland's governance was influenced by disputes with Virginia over land claims and colonization efforts. Virginia's expansion northward, including settlements like Kent Island, led to legal complexities and shared governance issues between the two colonies.|"1.

In March 1621, an Indian named Samoset welcomed the English settlers to the region. He brought Squanto, who spoke English and helped establish peace with Massasoit. The settlers faced challenges but managed to plant corn and build a community. The arrival of new settlers strained their resources, but they received aid from a ship captain. However, more newcomers led to theft and potential famine. To resolve the situation, Captain Miles Standish intervened, providing corn and dealing with unruly settlers.

Around this time, Bradford made a significant change in the way work was organized in the colony. Initially, they had a communal system, but this led to confusion and unhappiness. Bradford decided to assign a parcel of land to each family based on its size. When sixty new settlers arrived in July 1623, there were concerns about running out of food again. However, when the harvest came, the results were positive. Private ownership of land led to an abundance of corn, showing the success of this new approach. The Council for New England, on the other hand, faced challenges maintaining their monopoly on fishing and fur trading. Despite efforts to send out a colony, the venture faced obstacles, and many settlers returned to England.

The Plymouth settlers were angered by the French and sought help from Massachusetts, but were refused due to trade interests. This marked a shift in power towards Massachusetts. Plymouth's history became less significant after John Winthrop's government was established in 1630. By 1633, a fort was built on Connecticut River to control Indian trade, and in 1639, a treaty was renewed with Massasoit. Disputes over boundaries with Massachusetts were resolved through compromise. The population grew slowly until emigration to Massachusetts boosted it to 3,000. The new settlers caused concerns due to their behavior. Plymouth's population spread out, forming new towns like Duxbury. The governance evolved from John Carver to William Bradford and a council. A representative system was introduced in 1638, with delegates from each town contributing to the colony's laws. Membership in the church was closely tied to citizenship in Plymouth. The colony's laws, established in 1636, set strict criteria for suffrage.|"6. When were Plymouth's laws established according to the text?

In 1632, a tax for a fortification led to the formation of a board with town delegates advising on taxes. By 1634, a general court with elected delegates shared legislative powers. Despite changes, the court of assistants retained significant authority due to its ability to create laws, constant tenure, and discretionary powers.

This was a significant crisis in the history of the colony. The governor and assistants replied to Mr. Cradock that the charter could only be returned by the general court, not in session at that time. Simultaneously, orders were issued to fortify Castle Island, Dorchester, and Charlestown. During this intense moment, Endicott reappeared, making a dramatic impact on history. He strongly disliked the cross on the English flag, calling it antichrist, and personally removed it from the company's ensign in Salem. Endicott faced criticism from the general court for his actions. However, the cross was eventually removed from all flags except the one at the fort in Boston Harbor. Massachusetts also took steps to protect its interests in England. The Plymouth government sent Edward Winslow to England in July 1634 to present a humble petition. Despite Winslow's diplomatic skills, he was imprisoned for seventeen weeks in Fleet Prison due to Laud's influence. Gorges and Mason quickly acted on their victory, dividing the New England coast into twelve parts. This division led to various individuals receiving different territories. Despite challenges from the English government, Massachusetts continued to assert its independence and expand its territory.|"1.

"The enforcement of the 1631 law that required membership in the Congregational church for citizenship, combined with the influx of talented ministers who resented persecution against the Anglican church, solidified the bond and made it enduring.

In Massachusetts, even Puritans who didn't adhere to the prescribed church government were marginalized, bearing the burdens of church and state without a voice in governance.

In January 1634, when Williams faced the court, their concerns shifted to vague phrases in a document that seemed critical of the king. Williams clarified these expressions, professing loyalty and taking the oath of allegiance, which led to his forgiveness. The court's behavior may have been influenced by fears that the Massachusetts charter would be revoked by Ferdinando Gorges in England. Despite initial forgiveness, in November 1634, Williams faced new accusations for speaking against the king's patent and terming English churches as antichristian. The court, now under Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley, showed a change in attitude towards the English government. Williams continued to face challenges, objecting to legislation requiring oaths to defend the charter. This led to his banishment in October 1635 after refusing to renounce his beliefs. Despite attempts to silence him, Williams persisted in his convictions and eventually established a new settlement in Narragansett Bay.|"1.

Thirty-five years later, Williams reflected on a challenging time he faced during a harsh winter, where he felt lost and in need. Despite this, the kindness of the Pokanoket Indians, whom he had befriended, provided him with some land by the Seekonk River. However, the authorities of Massachusetts extended their reach to him even there. Governor Winslow advised Williams to move across the river to avoid displeasing the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Williams, along with five friends, then set up a settlement in Providence in June 1636. This marked the beginning of Rhode Island. In Massachusetts, the ruling class strictly regulated religion, focusing on God's wrath and eternal punishment. The teachings of pastors like John Cotton, emphasizing divine mercy and love, attracted many followers.

At this time, Governor Harry Vane added a political dimension to the existing challenges. Vane, a religious convert, gave up courtly honors to visit Massachusetts with his parents' approval. Shortly after arriving in 1636, he became the governor at just twenty-four, with John Winthrop as deputy governor. Amidst turmoil over the Wheelwright election, Vane, weary of the colony's strife, tried to resign citing personal matters. However, moved by the impending French and Indian threats, he withdrew his resignation. The religious tensions escalated with Mrs. Hutchinson's supporters rallying around Vane. The ministers clashed with Vane, and the legalists retaliated by summoning Wheelwright for his sermon.

In July 1633, Bradford and Winslow visited Boston to discuss a joint trading-post plan but faced objections about the sand-bar, ice, and Indians. Despite these, Plymouth sent a vessel in October 1633 with William Holmes to establish a trading-post. Upon arrival, they found the Dutch already there. The Dutch, feeling threatened by English growth, had built a fort. Holmes, undeterred by the Dutch commander's demand to stop, set up a post at Windsor. Meanwhile, a ship sent by Winthrop to Connecticut informed the Dutch of English territorial claims. Tensions rose, leading to armed confrontations. The Plymouth settlers faced challenges from both the Dutch and Massachusetts residents. The desire for land and political differences prompted some to seek new settlements. Rev. Thomas Hooker advocated for a more democratic government, leading to debates and petitions for relocation.|"1. What challenges did Bradford and Winslow face when they visited Boston in July 1633?

Despite these, Plymouth sent a vessel in October 1633 with William Holmes to establish a trading-post. Upon arrival, they found the Dutch already there. The Dutch, feeling threatened by English growth, had built a fort. Holmes, undeterred by the Dutch commander's demand to stop, set up a post at Windsor. Meanwhile, a ship sent by Winthrop to Connecticut informed the Dutch of English territorial claims. Tensions rose, leading to armed confrontations. The Plymouth settlers faced challenges from both the Dutch and Massachusetts residents. The desire for land and political differences prompted some to seek new settlements. Rev.

The popularity of the measure grew significantly, and there is a belief that in the winter of 1634-1635, some individuals from Watertown journeyed to Connecticut and survived the winter in a few huts at Pyquag, later known as Wethersfield. Subsequently, the people of Watertown and Dorchester followed the Newtown congregation's lead and sought permission from the general court to relocate. They were successful and allowed to move anywhere, even outside Massachusetts, as long as they remained under Massachusetts authority. This sparked a lively migration, with small groups of settlers arriving daily by land and water. The settlers' numbers and confidence grew, leading to conflicts with the Plymouth settlers over land ownership. The emigration continued in the summer of 1635, with a group of about sixty individuals, along with their livestock, embarking on a challenging journey to Connecticut. However, they faced harsh winter conditions and food shortages, eventually returning to Boston. Despite the hardships, the settlers persisted and prepared for further migration in the spring of 1636, led by ministers Thomas Hooker and Samuel Stone. This marked the establishment of three townships below Springfield, which were later renamed Hartford, Wethersfield, and Windsor. The settlements exemplified the New England colonization model, with organized communities migrating together under church leadership.|"1.

The Pequot nation faced complete destruction after the war. Most captives were enslaved, with some remaining in New England and others sent to the West Indies. Only about 200 Pequots were left in Connecticut. A treaty in 1638 transferred Pequot land to Connecticut towns, with 100 Pequots given to Uncas and another 100 to Miantonomoh and Ninigret. The war provided a 40-year reprieve from Indian threats in Connecticut. The Fundamental Orders, adopted in 1639, established Connecticut's first written constitution. The government was theocratic, with church membership not initially required for voting. The colony rapidly expanded its jurisdiction, annexing towns like Fairfield, Stratford, and Norwalk. Meanwhile, the New Haven colony, founded by John Davenport, aimed to create a theocratic state but ultimately settled independently due to disagreements with Massachusetts.|"1.

Only about 200 Pequots were left in Connecticut. A treaty in 1638 transferred Pequot land to Connecticut towns, with 100 Pequots given to Uncas and another 100 to Miantonomoh and Ninigret. The war provided a 40-year reprieve from Indian threats in Connecticut. The Fundamental Orders, adopted in 1639, established Connecticut's first written constitution. The government was theocratic, with church membership not initially required for voting. The colony rapidly expanded its jurisdiction, annexing towns like Fairfield, Stratford, and Norwalk. Meanwhile, the New Haven colony, founded by John Davenport, aimed to create a theocratic state but ultimately settled independently due to disagreements with Massachusetts.|"6.

In 1622, Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Mason secured a patent for a vast area between the Merrimack and Sagadahock rivers in New England. Mason, a London merchant with experience as governor of Newfoundland, was elected vice-president of the Council for New England. They established settlements in New Hampshire and Maine, with Piscataqua and Cocheco being the main ones. Mason later obtained a patent for New Hampshire, naming it after his estate in England. They invested in fish and fur trade but paid little attention to farming, leading to a challenging existence. The settlements had different governors and saw religious conflicts, including followers of Mrs. Hutchinson seeking refuge at Cocheco. Captain John Underhill played a role in these conflicts but later faced imprisonment for plotting against the Dutch. John Wheelwright established Exeter in 1638, and the settlers there and at Cocheco adopted civil contracts similar to those in Rhode Island.|"1.

"In the early days of New Hampshire, the transformation of fishing and trading spots into proper towns marked a significant political advancement. Each town remained distinct and self-reliant until Massachusetts took the lead in uniting them under one government.

Exeter also joined in 1643, losing its founder, Mr. Wheelwright, to banishment. The towns of Dover, Strawberry Bank, Exeter, and Hampton, along with Salisbury and Haverhill, formed the county of Norfolk.

They settled at Port Royal, named by Poutrincourt, after transferring from the Isle of St. Croix due to harsh winters. After three years, the Acadian settlers returned to France. Poutrincourt later returned in 1610 to re-establish the colony at Port Royal. Champlain, meanwhile, successfully founded a trading post at Quebec in 1608 and envisioned a prosperous French province in Canada.|"1.

The growth of the colony was disappointing to Champlain and the French authorities. In 1627, Cardinal Richelieu dissolved the company in charge and formed a new one with himself as the leader. In 1628, he sent armed ships and transports to Canada, but they were seized due to the war between England and France. The English did not recognize French claims in North America and attacked French settlements in Acadia. Sir William Alexander claimed New Scotland (now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick). In 1629, an English fleet led by David Kirke took over Quebec. However, due to a peace agreement, all conquests after April 24, 1629, had to be returned. In 1632, a treaty gave back New France, Acadia, and Canada to the French. Champlain returned to Quebec and Jesuit priests began exploring the Great Lakes and Mississippi. France appointed Chevalier Razilly as governor of Acadia, claiming dominion to Cape Cod. Quarrels arose between French leaders, leading to conflict in Acadia. The Dutch began exploring America in 1597, with Hudson's voyage in 1609 leading to the discovery of New Netherland (New York).

During the 17th century, the Dutch and English colonies in North America had their fair share of conflicts and negotiations. Massachusetts played a key role in advocating for peace, despite some tensions with the Dutch. Governor William Kieft of New Netherland understood the importance of maintaining friendly relations with Massachusetts. However, issues arose, such as complaints about Connecticut encroaching on Dutch territory. Over time, diplomatic efforts were made to address these disputes, with the intervention of the Mohawks leading to a peace agreement in 1645. Subsequently, Governor Peter Stuyvesant sought to establish clear territorial boundaries between the Dutch and English colonies, leading to arbitration and the delineation of boundaries in 1650. This diplomatic resolution, though criticized by some, marked an important step towards peaceful coexistence between the two colonial powers.|"1.

In the early days of Massachusetts, each town governed itself through a system of town meetings. The concept of town government began in Dorchester in 1633, followed by Watertown and Charlestown. These town meetings were crucial for local decision-making, appointing town officers, setting laws for common areas, managing herds, and more. The town system also enabled popular education, with the first public school in Boston in 1635. By 1647, Massachusetts required towns with fifty households to teach reading and writing, and those with a hundred households to establish grammar schools. Connecticut adopted similar laws in 1650. Despite these laws, education quality varied, with parents often having to pay teachers. John Harvard's donation led to the establishment of Harvard College in 1638. Throughout New England, education was limited to the privileged classes, and illiteracy was common among fishermen and small farmers. Money shortages led to the use of wampum and bartering with goods. Harsh laws governed daily life, with strict regulations against various activities and the absence of Christmas celebrations or saints' days. The penal system was rigid, with many crimes punishable by death and magistrates holding significant power to punish individuals based on suspicion.|"1.
