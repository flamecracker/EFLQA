Once a powerful prince of Thrace, Orpheus played not only his lute but also the heart of the beautiful Eurydice. Their marriage should have brought happiness, but omens foretold otherwise.

In the shadow of the woodlands, Orpheus expressed his sorrow through the song of his lute. Even the fiercest forest beasts showed him pity.
