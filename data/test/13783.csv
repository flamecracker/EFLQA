"""I tell you, electricity is the thing. Beats gasoline a million ways,"" said Tom Jesson, sitting beside his cousin Jack Chadwick in a unique car speeding towards Nestorville, the town near Boston where the Boy Inventors lived. The car, named the Electric Monarch, was unlike any other. It was sleek, black, and silent, with a triangular front instead of a hood. It ran smoothly on wire-wheels without the usual noise and pollution of a gasoline engine. As they tested the car, Dick Donovan, a reporter, marveled at its innovative design. The Electric Monarch used a special device to power the batteries, making it cost-effective and eco-friendly. The boys had created a solution for affordable and efficient transportation, a breakthrough that would surely capture attention."|"1. What is the main topic of the text passage?

"""Let me simplify the concept of radio telephony for you,"" explained Mr. Chadwick. ""When you speak into a phone, the microphone records your voice as electrical impulses. These impulses travel along the wire to the receiver, where a metal disc vibrates to reproduce the sound. The vibrations in the disc compress or rarefy the air, transmitting the sound to the ear of the listener. The challenge in radio telephony is replicating these vibrations over Hertzian waves instead of wires. Unlike wireless telegraphy, where all energy is utilized, in radio telephony, only variations in waves can be detected, resulting in significant energy waste. To transmit the human voice effectively, high-frequency currents are needed, a task that has posed challenges in early experiments."""|"1. What is the main challenge in radio telephony?

E) Detecting variations in waves"|C) Reproducing vibrations over Hertzian waves|
"""Let me simplify the concept of radio telephony for you,"" explained Mr. Chadwick. ""When you speak into a phone, the microphone records your voice as electrical impulses. These impulses travel along the wire to the receiver, where a metal disc vibrates to reproduce the sound. The vibrations in the disc compress or rarefy the air, transmitting the sound to the ear of the listener. The challenge in radio telephony is replicating these vibrations over Hertzian waves instead of wires. Unlike wireless telegraphy, where all energy is utilized, in radio telephony, only variations in waves can be detected, resulting in significant energy waste. To transmit the human voice effectively, high-frequency currents are needed, a task that has posed challenges in early experiments."""|"2.

The doctor explained how the bag exploded with a loud bang upon hitting the ground but assured that all was well. He asked why they braved the storm, suspecting an urgent matter. Tom agreed to go once he packed. Concerned about Tom's overworked father, the doctor warned of consequences for not resting. Tom hung the doctor's coat and they set off in the Wondership, braving the stormy night. Jack, the driver, used the searchlights to illuminate the road as they sped through the muddy, rainy night. Suddenly, they encountered a hay wagon blocking their path. Jack quickly inflated the balloon bag, propelling the Wondership into the sky to bypass the obstacle. Despite rough conditions, they continued their journey at high speed, with Jack navigating the stormy night with skill.|"6. How did Jack navigate the stormy night?

Jack urged Tom to use all the power available as the Wondership swayed wildly but managed to stabilize. Jack steered upstream to avoid being carried too far downstream by the rushing water. The creek was flanked by steep limestone walls, posing a challenge. The propellers fought against the air, pushing the Wondership upstream amidst the roaring water. Quickly and narrowly, they reached the opposite side. They barely made it, but it was enough. Jack then revealed the financial turmoil faced by Mr. Chadwick. Dr. Mays suggested easing his worries by potentially recovering his fortune. Jack and Tom proposed an expedition using their share from the hydroaëroplane plant. They planned to explore with Zeb Cummings and the professor, forming the Z.2.X. Exploration Company to help Mr. Chadwick.

Dr. Mays, after being fully informed of the situation, allowed the boys to proceed with their plan to go on a trip. He assured Mr. Chadwick that the boys would be fine, as there were enough funds left from the inventor's fortune to sustain them comfortably during their absence, in addition to royalties from past inventions.

"""No, but I will someday,"" said the old man with a determined look in his eyes. ""I'll find it someday, Zeb. I never got to it, but I came close—yes, sir, old Pete came close.""

""That explains it,"" said old Pete kindly. ""You can't expect Easterners to know about it. Somewhere out in the desert to the east, there are three buttes sticking up, and right there is Peg-leg Smith's lost mine where the sands are said to be made of gold.""

Who was Peg-leg? Well, that's not very well known. His name was Smith, and he was missing a leg, hence the nickname. Back in 1836, Peg-leg arrived in Yuma with a group of trappers who had worked down the Colorado River.

They decided to stop trapping and search for gold, heading up the Gila River and then into the desert. From Yuma, they traveled southeast for four days across the desert. By the end of the fourth day, they were running out of water and decided to look for a water-hole in a canyon where three lone buttes stood like sentinels against the sky.

They searched the canyon but found no water. Eventually, they reached the buttes. Climbing to the top of the southernmost butte, Peg-leg found chunks of black rock with specks and chunks of bright yellow. Peg-leg thought the yellow was copper or fool's gold.

It was midnight, and the moon shone brightly in the cloudless sky over the Boy Inventors' camp. Three mysterious figures approached cautiously, each carrying a spade and a sack. They paused to survey the camp before heading towards the plateau where the adventurers had been working. Masterson was the first to notice signs of digging and alerted his friends. Silently, the intruders crept down the slope towards the mineral-rich barren ground. As they began digging, dark figures from the camp followed suit, observing their actions.
