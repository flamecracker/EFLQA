Despite their efforts, Seymour and his crew faced a dire situation. They were being pursued by an English frigate, and the only chance of escape was navigating through a treacherous shoal called George's Shoal. Seymour, familiar with the dangerous channel through the shoal, believed he could guide their ship, the Mellish, to safety. If the pursuing English captain knew of the shoal, he would have to take a long detour, giving the Mellish a chance to escape. However, if the English captain was unaware of the shoal, he risked losing his ship by chasing too hard.

General Mercer and his officers bravely fought until their last breath. Hilary's sacrifice allowed the general to rise, but they all perished in the battle.

The lawyer, doctor, and minister were by Madam Talbot's side all day, but little could be done. She added a codicil to her will, took the doctor's medicine, and listened to the priest's prayers. The next morning, she was even calmer, whiter, and stiller. She had gone to meet her son in a new country. In February, the Continental ship Randolph, a thirty-two-gun frigate, set sail from Charleston, South Carolina, under Captain John Seymour Seymour. The ship had been repaired after a storm in Philadelphia and had already captured six prizes. The departure was urgent as English ships were spotted off the coast. Governor Rutledge arranged for State ships to join the Randolph in search of the British. The squadron, led by the Randolph, set sail with other ships like the General Moultrie and the Fair American. Captain Philip Wilton commanded the Fair American, showing his worth despite his youth. The ships, converted merchantmen, were not ideal for battle, but Seymour was confident in their ability. The crew, handpicked by Seymour, was skilled and well-trained. Bentley, the boatswain, held great influence among the crew, while Spicer, the carpenter, shared his sentiments about the sea.|"1.
