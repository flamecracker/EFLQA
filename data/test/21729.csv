One day, a mother in need came to seek help for her three children. They were poorly dressed and had nowhere to sleep. The mother hoped to find work for the day and earn some money for a place to stay. She couldn't bring the children along while job hunting. The kind-hearted individuals decided to take the children in, feed them, and provide care. Later that day, the mother returned exhausted and hungry after failing to secure work.

The next morning, the knight woke up still pondering the same thoughts. He found inspiration for discussions with little Di for a long time. Doctors advise that a change of air is usually good, sometimes necessary, and almost always enjoyable. Following this wisdom, let's shift our scene to the vast Atlantic Ocean to refresh our minds.

I apologize; Mr. Crossly Cowel had no valid claim to his vast wealth since he did not earn it, rather inherited it from his father.

This thought was shared by North, who further emphasized the inequality in wealth distribution. He challenged the reformer to act on his principles by giving his coat to a destitute man present, highlighting the disparity between the haves and have-nots. Eventually, the reformer relented and donated a small sum, which brought immense relief to the impoverished man.
