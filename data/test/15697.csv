Grandfather sat with the children gathered around him, eager to hear more about the history of the chair. He spoke of Roger Williams, a clergyman who settled in Salem in 1631 and spent many hours in the chair penning sermons or reading theology by the light of pitchpine torches. Grandfather mentioned an incident involving Williams and John Endicott, where they discussed the Red Cross on the English banner, which the Puritans abhorred as a relic of idolatry. Endicott was troubled by the banner's presence in Salem and Boston, considering it a symbol of subjection to the Pope. Williams agreed, stating he couldn't fight or bless under such a banner. Endicott resolved to rid Massachusetts of the papal banner, showing the strong beliefs and actions of the early settlers.|"6.

Not long after, a military muster was held in Salem. Every able man in town and nearby areas attended. They were all well-armed with steel caps, iron plates on their chests and backs, and steel gorgets around their necks. When the sun shone on these iron-clad men, they gleamed, dazzling the wild Indians who came out of the woods to watch. The soldiers carried long pikes, swords, and muskets that were almost as heavy as small cannons. These men looked stern and rigid, with hearts seemingly as ironclad as their armor. They were devoted Puritans, much like those who supported Oliver Cromwell. Despite hating Popish superstitions, the banner of the Red Cross flew over them. Endicott, their captain, took the banner and cut out the Papal Cross, showing their allegiance to God over the Pope. This act caused concern among the leaders of Massachusetts, fearing repercussions. The story of Endicott's bold move, though risky, showed his strong Puritan beliefs and desire for religious freedom.|"1. What did the soldiers carry during the military muster in Salem?

Once upon a time, Grandfather shared the fascinating history of a chair with the children. He spoke of the early settlements in New England, like Plymouth in 1620 and Hartford in 1635, founded by ministers Hooker and Stone, who trekked through the woods with their congregation. In 1638, Mr. Davenport established New Haven, while others sought refuge in Rhode Island. Communities sprouted along the coast, linked by their English roots. French colonies occupied Canada, Dutch settled in New Netherlands along the Hudson River, and English made homes in Maine and New Hampshire. Grandfather paused his tales as Charley grew restless. The children cherished the chair, imagining the historical figures it cradled. With pride, Grandfather recounted the chair's rich past, connecting it to Harvard College's early days, a beacon of education for future generations.|"1.

During the 17th century, Massachusetts and the rest of New England were fairly self-sufficient, as England was embroiled in a civil war. With King Charles beheaded in 1649, Oliver Cromwell took charge. Being a Puritan, Cromwell supported the Puritan colonies in America. The historical chair from that era, once used by governors, broke its leg and was sold to Captain John Hull, the mint-master of Massachusetts. At that time, money was scarce in the colonies, and people resorted to bartering goods like bear skins, molasses, and musket bullets. To address the need for currency, a coinage of shillings, sixpences, and threepences was established, with Captain John Hull overseeing the minting process. The resulting coins, known as pine-tree shillings, featured a pine tree on one side and the year 1652 on the other. Captain Hull earned a shilling for every twenty coins minted.|"1.

"""Boys, enjoy your playtime today, for tomorrow is a school day with lessons and discipline. In the early days of Massachusetts, Thursdays were lecture days, and school was out in the afternoons. The schoolmaster, Master Ezekiel Cheever, was a strict but caring teacher who dedicated his life to educating young minds. He passed away in 1707 after teaching for about seventy years.

Grandfather shared the story of Cotton Mather, a man who believed in evil spirits lurking everywhere. He thought they hid in books and men's hearts. Little Alice, feeling scared, asked Grandfather to stop. He comforted her, saying angels were the only spirits she should think about. Grandfather then talked about the ongoing war between France and England in 1702, causing harm to New England. The New Englanders despised the French for inciting Indian attacks. They aimed to conquer Quebec to secure Canada. Despite past failed attempts, they continued military expeditions. In 1710, Port Royal fell to the English. In 1711, Admiral Sir Hovenden Walker arrived in Boston to prepare for a campaign against Canada. However, disaster struck when ships wrecked, and soldiers drowned. The war ended in 1713, giving New England a much-needed break from the constant military activities that drained resources and manpower.|"1. What did Cotton Mather believe evil spirits hid in?

Grandfather explained how the governors of the American colonies were often appointed by the king based on connections rather than merit, leading to conflicts with the legislature. Governor Burnet, despite his good character, faced challenges as he was bound by the king's instructions. His term was marred by disputes with the legislature, which ultimately led to his death. The refusal to grant him a salary during his lifetime contrasted with the grand funeral held in his honor. The changing social norms influenced by English fashion and the extravagant lifestyles of the royal governors and wealthy individuals marked a shift towards pomp and ceremony. The old chair witnessed this transformation, likely attending grand balls and festivals characterized by luxury and opulence.|"1.

Long ago, our ancestors traded not only black slaves from Africa but also Indians from South America and white people from Ireland.

Governor Belcher spent much of his term trying to stabilize the currency. The pine-tree shillings were gone, replaced by paper bills valued at three pence or more, but their worth kept decreasing. The people faced endless problems due to the devaluing currency. Suspicions arose that Belcher was trying to impose the Episcopal worship, leading to his resignation in 1740. William Shirley took over, known for his law background but was an active governor. In 1744, war erupted between France and England. Shirley planned an attack on Louisbourg in 1745, a French stronghold near Nova Scotia. The siege required extensive preparation, including gathering soldiers, arms, and support from neighboring colonies. The choice of a general was crucial as military experience was lacking after a long period of peace.|"1. What was one of the main challenges faced by Governor Belcher during his term?

"""The English Parliament,"" said Grandfather, ""agreed to pay the colonists for all the expenses of the siege. In 1749, two hundred and fifteen chests of Spanish dollars and one hundred casks of copper coin arrived in Boston from England, totaling about a million dollars. Twenty-seven carts carried the money to the provincial treasury. Grandfather explained that war brings physical and moral evil that no amount of gold can compensate. The siege tested the colonists' war readiness for the Revolution. The success against Louisbourg led to a plan to conquer Canada by Shirley and Pepperell, which was not executed. In 1746, fear arose due to the French fleet led by the Duke d‚ÄôAnville, but disasters caused the fleet to retreat. Governor Shirley faced unrest in 1747 when the Boston mob protested the impressment of citizens by British Commodore Knowles. Peace between France and England in 1748 allowed the governor to relax. The children gathered around Grandfather's chair on Thanksgiving, marking a day of joy and reflection on past blessings and experiences."""|"1.

Grandfather, a man of wisdom and experience, shared stories with the children, finding joy in being of importance and bringing happiness to others. The old cat, comfortable by the fire, joined in the warmth and coziness of the moment. Grandfather recounted the history of a chair from the year 1748, highlighting the treaty that restored Louisbourg to the French. The French, fearing another war, built strong fortifications in North America, encircling the English colonies. These forts stood amidst the vast forests, a stark contrast of military might in serene landscapes. The tensions escalated, leading to the outbreak of the Old French War in 1754. Governor Shirley, a key figure, took command in the English forces, leaving behind the comfort of home to face the challenges of war. Despite the bloodshed and defeats, the valor of George Washington shone through in preserving the remnants of the English army.|"1. What did Grandfather share stories about with the children?
