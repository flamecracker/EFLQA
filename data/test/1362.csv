Tom Swift and his friend Ned were flying back home in Tom's Air Scout after bidding farewell to Mary and her mother. Tom was deep in thought about Dixwell Hardley, whom he didn't trust. Despite his reservations, Tom was determined to continue with their plans to find a treasure ship. Tom wished he could locate the ship, give Hardley his share, and return to his work. He envisioned creating an airship as easy to use as a car. After dropping off Ned, Tom discussed the treasure-hunting trip with Mr. Damon and Hardley. They were eager to start the adventure. Tom was concerned about keeping the gold they found, but Hardley assured him they could claim it legally. Tom was skeptical of Hardley's intentions and disliked him more as time passed. Busy days followed as Tom rushed to complete the submarine for the treasure hunt. Mary christened the submarine the M.

Tom decided to test the submarine's capabilities by going deeper. As they reached 450 feet, tension filled the air. The craft successfully reached the ocean floor, proving its strength. Despite the confined space and reliance on compressed air and electric lights, Tom and his crew were comfortable. Mr. Hardley expressed concern about potential treasure hunters reaching the ship first, but Tom remained determined to reach their goal.|"1.

Tom Swift, the young inventor, wanted to ensure that everything on the submarine was in order before venturing out for a test dive. He planned to try the new diving outfit and invited Ned and Koku to join. The special diving suits were prepared, with a giant-sized suit made for Koku. The suits were equipped with compressed air tanks and reinforced steel sheets to withstand the water pressure at great depths. The divers would have the freedom to explore the ocean floor without being tethered to the submarine. Once ready, Ned and Koku entered a steel chamber in the submarine, and as the water rushed in to equalize pressure, they prepared to step outside for their underwater adventure. Tom watched as the divers, illuminated by portable lights, moved gracefully through the Atlantic waters.|"1. What was Tom Swift's main objective before the test dive?

Tom, equipped with a new electric gun, fired a powerful electric charge at the starfish, aiming to stun or kill it. With Koku wielding an axe and Norton with a lance, they joined forces to attack the creature. After a tense moment, the starfish began to loosen its grip on Ned as the electric current took effect. With a swift stroke, Koku severed one of the starfish's arms, while Norton thrust his lance deep into its body, ensuring its demise. The team successfully freed Ned, and as the creature floated away, a school of fish swiftly devoured it. However, a new danger emerged as hungry sharks approached the scene, prompting the team to retreat to safety inside the submarine.|"2. Who wielded an axe during the attack on the starfish?

Tom and his companions spent the day cruising in the open sea, recharging their batteries and preparing for their search for the Pandora, which Tom estimated would take some time. Finding the sunken ship in the deep sea wouldn't be easy. Ned and Mr. Damon fished while on the surface, providing a welcome change from their usual food. Thanks to Tom's refrigerating plant, they had fresh meat along with tinned and preserved foods. After consulting charts and calculating their progress, Tom predicted they would reach the Pandora's location in a day or two. To avoid navigating in darkness, they submerged the craft at night, resting on the seabed. The next morning, they ascended towards the Pandora's location. Despite a storm on the surface, they continued their journey underwater, making progress towards their destination.|"1.

Tom and his crew were on a mission to find a sunken treasure, but they realized they were at the wrong starting point. Tom was confident that their close proximity to the treasure's location gave them an advantage over others, like Hardley, who might also be searching. Tom understood the complex science of navigation, involving meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude, to precisely determine a ship's position on the open sea. By calculating the sun's position, using stars for guidance, and having accurate time measurements, a navigator could pinpoint their exact location. Tom quickly ordered their ship to the correct nautical point, knowing that their proximity and navigation skills would give them a better chance at finding the treasure.|"1.

The depth gauge displayed over a thousand feet below as the M. N. 1 settled. Tom was surprised by the depth but his craft could handle the pressure. After a quick check, they began the search. The craft moved in wider circles underwater. They didn't find the treasure ship on the first day, but Tom had not promised immediate success. Ned suggested redoing current experiments when a sudden collision threw them off their feet. The crew worked to assess the damage. Automatic devices detected leaks and started pumps to remove water. Tom suspected multiple sections may have been breached. They decided to inspect the damage wearing diving suits. Mr. Damon, though willing, was not allowed due to safety concerns.|"5.

After the close call with the collision, Tom and his friends found themselves walking on the sandy seabed outside the submarine. Surrounded by a variety of fish, some quite large, they seemed harmless as they swiftly swam away. Moving cautiously due to the water pressure, they circled the submarine's nose. In the searchlight's glow, they spotted a partially buried steamer with its name still visible. Tom decided to investigate further. They noticed a peculiar current beyond the wreck and realized it was caused by the meeting of two strong currents. Staying behind the wreck provided safety from the powerful current. Using chains and a ladder left by the crew, they boarded the steamer easily. The Pandora was accessible, and they explored the cabins, focusing on the captain's cabin and the purser's strong room in search of valuable items.|"1.

"The commander's cabin was easily identified by the brass plate above the door that read ""Captain."" Tom and Ned stepped inside to find chaos, not just from the sea's movements. The safe was open, emptied of its contents, as were the drawers and lockers. It was clear they had found the treasure room. Among the gold pieces in small boxes, iron disks disguised as gold were discovered. The crew worked tirelessly to inspect each box, revealing a cruel hoax - only iron disks filled the remaining containers. Tom estimated the total value to be around ten to fifteen thousand dollars.

Tom explained that many plots involve someone investing money to gain control of a country, often for what they believe is the country's benefit. However, in this case, someone made a substitution, leaving the patriots at a loss. Despite not finding what he expected, Tom considered the trip a valuable experience where he learned something new. Although he didn't need the money, he sympathized with Mr. Damon's investment with Hardley. As they prepared to store the recovered gold, divers from the Pandora returned with a small steel box. Tom suspected that Hardley had returned with a different ship to try and recover the gold. Looking out through the glass windows, they saw a grappling iron near the wreck, indicating Hardley's presence on a nearby steamer. Tom asserted his independence and emphasized that he found unexpected knowledge during the adventure.|"1. What did Tom learn from his trip?

Tom spoke about the Pandora, drawing a parallel to the ancient story of Pandora's box. He mentioned that most of the treasures seemed to have disappeared, leaving only Hope behind. However, they found a box on the Pandora, and when they managed to open it with Koku's strength, they discovered bundles of papers inside. These papers turned out to be the missing documents related to an oil-well deal, proving that Barton Keith owned a significant share in a valuable property. Tom suspected that Hardley, who was after the papers, might have known about their presence on the ship. Despite the gold being missing, the discovery of the papers revealed a fortune, confirming Mary's uncle's wealth. Tom speculated that Hardley might have orchestrated the search for the papers to claim them as his own. Ultimately, the M.
