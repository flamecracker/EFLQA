Two hours after being taken into custody, I was escorted to a large room following a descent down several flights of stairs. In this room, twelve elderly men sat around a dark table. The Governor, a man with a somber demeanor, addressed the audience, expressing his inability to judge impartially due to his paternal feelings.

The court adjourned for the day for further inquiries. The next day, letters were found bearing my handwriting, containing threats against the deceased.
