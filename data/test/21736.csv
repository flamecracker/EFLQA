As I pondered these thoughts, I stood up and shook myself awake. I patted my chest, pinched my nose, and sat back down. Shortly after, I felt drowsiness creeping in once more. Startled, I sprang up, tended to the fires, and paced back and forth until fully alert. To avoid a repeat, I peered into the dark forest beyond the light's reach. Suddenly, my knees buckled, jolting me awake just in time. Alarmed, I feared wild beasts attacking if I dozed off. Battling sleep, I recited verses to stay vigilant. A terrifying scream jolted me up, realizing my rifle was missing. Peterkin scolded me, but it turned out to be a prank to teach me a lesson.

We busied ourselves gathering the dying embers of our fire and preparing breakfast with tea, hard biscuit, and cold monkey. Despite the monkey's good taste, it resembled a small roasted baby, making it unappetizing. We had set off hunting, aiming to live off our rifles, but only encountered monkeys. After a merchant ship journey from Liverpool to Africa, we joined a Portuguese trader heading inland to learn the native language and find a guide to reach the gorilla country. The African tribes' trade system hindered direct trading, requiring goods to pass through many tribes before reaching the coast. To avoid trouble, we planned to clarify our intentions with each tribe. Eager to hunt gorillas, we set off from a native village, hoping to add one to our animal collection. After breakfast, we packed up and headed back to the village, with Jack carrying the heaviest load.|"1. What did the group have for breakfast in the text passage?

The bull changed course towards Peterkin, who was trapped and defenseless. Overwhelmed with fear for my friend's safety, I struggled to act, my hands trembling as I tried to reload my rifle.

Jack made no effort to load his weapon, but instead, he let out a fearful cry and leaped towards our companion like an angry tiger.

A muff is a boy who is mild, diffident, and gentle, but to truly earn the title of a muff, he must also be timid and unenthusiastic.

Muffs tend to boast around girls but shrink on the playground. Courage and cowardice are not black and white; they can be developed through training. It's important for muffs to build courage by learning to swim, leap, run, and defend themselves. By facing challenges and practicing bravery, muffs can grow into sensible individuals who are lions in the field when needed.

At that moment, I saw Peterkin rush to my side; our guns boomed through the woods. The elephant leaped over Jack and crashed to the ground, toppling a tree. We quickly helped Jack up, but shouts ahead warned us of new danger. Reloading, we hurried forward to find the second elephant menacing King Jambai. The king was perched precariously on a tree, trying to fend off the beast. The elephant, determined, began to break the tree. The natives fought with spears, but the elephant persisted. Finally, the elephant succumbed, and the natives rejoiced. As evening fell, we camped on higher ground. Reflecting on the day's events, Peterkin cautioned about the dangers of shooting at charging elephants. We observed the tusks of the fallen elephant, a valuable find. Despite some losses to white ants, we learned valuable lessons from the day's hunt. The night in camp was filled with fires, stories, and the aroma of cooking elephant and venison steaks, creating a wild and unforgettable atmosphere.|"5.

The African American has a special fondness for fire. In his warm climate, the nights feel cold to him, and he revels in the warmth of a fire like a cat in the sun. The fire seems to draw out his entire being, making his eyes sparkle with joy. A good meal and a cozy fire make him almost perfectly content. The only thing missing for his complete happiness is a pipe! Under similar circumstances, a white man may also be content, but the African American expresses his happiness more openly, forgetting his worries and enjoying the moment wholeheartedly. As I sat by the fire with my friends, their happy faces, made even brighter by our gift of tobacco, filled me with joy. It was hard to believe that these cheerful men, who seemed so kind and jolly, were the same individuals known for their cruelty and superstitions. The scene felt like a dream, especially after a day filled with hunting imaginary gazelles, lions, and elephants. The next morning, I observed my friend Peterkin's peculiar morning routine, trying to understand his eccentricities. His actions and musings seemed like a mix of reality and dreams, making him a fascinating character to study.|"1. What does the African American express openly when near a fire?

"At the height of our adventure, I couldn't hold back any longer and burst into laughter upon realizing that Peterkin had spent the night hunting just like I had. However, our accomplishments were quite different. Peterkin joked about dreaming of bagging fifteen elephants and ten lions, carrying them all on his back without feeling the weight. He even decided to call me ""Mak"" instead of my long name. Soon, Makarooroo, the friendly local, served us a delectable round of meat that we eagerly devoured. After a hearty meal, we, along with the king and his people, prepared to continue our journey towards the gorilla land. During the hunt, I marveled at the daring way the locals loaded their guns with excessive powder and shot. As we returned to the village, we sensed an impending superstitious frenzy that could lead to tragedy. Mak warned us of potential danger, but assured us that white men were respected and safe. We made it clear that we were prepared to defend ourselves if needed."|"1. What did Peterkin dream of bagging during the night's hunt?

Peterkin suggested that before departing, the guide should explain the day's route using a mix of phrases and signs. While engrossed in conversation, they had forgotten about the prisoners who were tied up nearby. The prisoners managed to free themselves and attempted to escape.

We then resumed our journey and camped near a palm grove described by Makarooroo. He and Jack joined us that night, sharing Jack's successful day hunting antelope, spotting a zebra, rhinoceros, and other game. We learned Okandaga was safe nearby. We met Mbango, the chief, who warmly welcomed us, offered food, and invited us to hunt with his people. Despite declining, we promised to return after gorilla hunting. Leaving Okandaga under Mbango's care, we assured her safety. Peterkin impressed them with his marksmanship and convinced them of our extraordinary abilities.

Upon reaching the location, I was amazed by what I saw. The bird had taken huge steps measuring fourteen feet each! I used my yard-measure to confirm - there were exactly thirty of these gigantic paces between two bushes. Calculating the speed, it covered nearly thirty miles in an hour. When Jack didn't return, we grew worried. As the sun set and night approached, we set out to search for him. We shouted periodically, hoping he would hear, but found only a man's footprints in the soft soil. Surprised, we discovered blood and a naked footprint, not matching Jack's. Following the prints, we found a rhinoceros and then Jack, wounded and lying in a pool of blood. We tended to his injuries with care, hoping for his recovery.|"1.

While I helped my friend with his wounds and adjusted the bandages, my friends cut two poles. We placed them on the ground, parallel and about two feet apart. Then, we laid our three coats across them, securing them roughly with cords I had. We placed our friend on this makeshift stretcher and lifted him onto our shoulders. Peterkin and I carried the rear poles, while Makarooroo supported the other end on his shoulders. Surprisingly, our injured friend endured the journey better than expected. We were fortunate to be near a native village where we decided to take him for recovery. The chief, related to King Jambai, welcomed us warmly. Our friend healed well over three weeks, and we were kindly treated, even though the villagers had never seen white people before.|"1.

The stories that the locals have been sharing with me through Mak as a translator have made me doubtful. They claim that a gorilla is so powerful that it can lift a person off the ground with one of its hind feet. They say the gorilla lurks on lower tree branches in dark woods, waiting for prey. When a person passes by, the gorilla uses its hind foot to lift them into the tree and strangle them. They don't mention if the gorilla eats its victims. Jack and I agree that while these tales are incredible, they hint at the existence of such creatures in this wild land. The locals believe that some gorillas house the spirits of deceased individuals and are distinguished by their size and aggression. They are said to be untouchable and have a liking for sugar cane, stealing it boldly from the natives.|"1. What do the locals claim the gorilla can do with one of its hind feet?

"""We set off on our journey riding oxen, but our adventure was far from smooth. The first ox was restless, the second even more so, and the third was finally calm enough for Jack to ride. However, our patience was tested as the oxen tried to throw us off. We were belaboured with twigs to make them move, but they still resisted. Suddenly, a large branch knocked me off, and Peterkin was thrown off by his ox. The animals ran off but were recaptured by our helpers. Despite the challenges, we continued our journey, facing dangers and amusing encounters. We struggled with water scarcity and nearly considered abandoning the oxen.

After giving our thirst a break, we watched the oxen drinking eagerly at the pond, their eyes softening with contentment. Their bellies, once sunken, now swelled to the point of bursting after quenching their thirst. Unfortunately, these creatures were plagued by the tsetse fly, a tiny yet deadly insect in Africa. This fly, fatal to animals like horses and oxen, causes swelling and eventual death. However, it does not harm humans. When bitten, the animals display symptoms like swelling, runny eyes, and emaciation before passing away. Natives avoid the fly's habitat to protect their herds. We encountered natives on our journey, startling one warrior who mistook us for ghosts. Laughter ensued, terrifying the warrior more. Eventually, we shared food and parted ways, understanding their struggles.|"1. What effect did quenching their thirst have on the oxen at the pond?

For a moment, we froze, ready with our guns, anticipating an attack. Leaves and branches rustled where the wounded monster had been. We cautiously followed, finding the gorilla tearing the ground, its thighs broken. Its chest beat like a drum, a terrifying sight. The monster's expression was demonic, striking fear. As it roared and tried to rise, its legs failed, and it collapsed in fury. Jack, steady, shot it dead as it lunged. The gorilla's colossal size and strength amazed us.

One evening, as I worked by the campfire while my companions slept, their restless features and clenched hands hinted at fierce battles with gorillas in their dreams. The day after our first gorilla encounter was significant, with ten gorillas sighted. We hunted four, sparing a baby and its mother. We debated whether to camp by a brook or hunt across the plain. Jack proposed we split up, but Peterkin cleverly argued against it. Eventually, we decided to hunt. We encountered a wounded monkey, its death touching our hearts. Despite our reluctance to shoot monkeys, hunger sometimes forced our hand. As we set off across the plain, the beauty of nature and the Creator's provision filled me with awe. Our journey was peaceful, yet the presence of savage men in such a paradise troubled me. Our reflections were cut short by Jack's voice.|"1.

Not all boys are the same. Some are brave and fearless like the boys in the navy, willing to take on great challenges. However, there are also boys who are experts at deceit.

"In a sing-song voice, Doddle began listing parts of speech. When he mentioned ""hadies,"" the master silenced the boys. Doddle was singled out and confronted by the master, who found out Doddle's deception. Doddle was made to stay behind while the other boys went to play. During that time, Doddle transformed into a diligent student. He excelled in his studies and became one of the best scholars in the school. Doddle's behavior changed for the better, and he stopped pretending to be unintelligent. The story shifts to a forest where the group encounters a gorilla. The hunters approach the gorilla cautiously, and after a tense moment, they successfully shoot the gorilla and its young. The experience leaves the narrator with conflicting emotions about hunting such creatures. Peterkin appreciates the narrator's ethical dilemma and warns against joking in serious situations."|"1.

I was eager to study the different gorilla species and individuals, so I wanted to shoot as many gorillas as possible. After examining the first gorilla thoroughly and taking detailed notes, we killed a female gorilla and her two young ones. We secured them in a tree to study later. Despite finding fresh footprints, we didn't encounter more gorillas. When we spotted a female gorilla with her baby, I couldn't bear to see them harmed and stopped a companion from shooting. The guide, accustomed to harsh acts, reloaded his gun. My friends teased me for being too tender-hearted, but I believed trials like these were beneficial for both humans and animals. The guide, amused by our banter, pretended to search for gorillas while secretly listening to our conversation.|"1. What was the speaker's initial attitude towards studying gorillas?

In the dense forest, we encountered an enormous gorilla, standing over six feet tall with a jet-black face filled with rage.

The noise that followed our gunshots was beyond words. It was a chaotic mix of trumpeting, roaring, crashing, and shrieking. It felt like the wild beasts of many menageries were breaking free all at once. The thunderous sounds of large animals were terrifying. Suddenly, a royal roar from a lion behind us sent shivers down our spines. We were petrified. Makarooroo's tales of man-eating lions made us spring up in fear. As we turned to face the lion, a wounded rhinoceros charged towards us. In a moment of panic, we ran in different directions. I tripped and fell, narrowly escaping the rhinoceros's stampede.
