You and I will go to the market every day with baskets on our arms, and we'll go by the walls, where your father works. It's a roundabout way, but what of that? We'll go at the time your father eats with the other slaves, and as we pass, we'll drop the two biscuits in his lap.""

It was decided that the two girls would carry fruit baskets on their heads, and Hester would have the biscuits in her right hand to drop them into her father's lap without stopping as they passed. Hester was aware of the danger to herself and her father and resolved to control her emotions. When she saw her father with the other workers, she fought the urge to embrace him and instead dropped the biscuits into his lap. Her father was surprised but managed to hide the biscuits before the guards noticed. This act of kindness gave him comfort and strength to face his work, knowing that someone cared for him. Hugh Sommers, Hester's father, couldn't rest that night, preoccupied with thoughts of the unexpected gift."|"6. What was the impact of the unexpected gift on Hugh Sommers?
