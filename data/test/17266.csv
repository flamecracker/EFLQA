The Boy Scout movement originated in England, where it has ties to the military, as young men there often anticipate serving in the armed forces. However, in America, the focus is on promoting peace. To become a tenderfoot scout, one must understand scout law, signs, salutes, and the national flag. Advancing to second-class and first-class scouts involves mastering skills like knot tying and earning merit badges in various activities. The idea of forming a troop excites the group, with Paul being nominated as scout master due to his knowledge of the outdoors. Patrols within a troop are named after animals like fox or wildcat, and each member should be able to mimic the animal's call. The commitment to the Scout law emphasizes bravery and helping others, rather than resorting to violence. Paul's enthusiasm to start a troop in Stanhope grows as he learns more about the movement from neighboring towns.|"1. What is the main focus of the Boy Scout movement in America?
