"""Wow!"" exclaimed Brother Roach, looking amazed. ""Who would have thought it? From the nigger in the woodpile to the nigger in the steeple, and soon they'll be flying in the air. I call it the boldness of the devil. Do you know that nigger, Brother Brannum?""

""My eyes see it differently. They say he's as strong as a horse, venomous as a snake, swift as the wind, and slick as a fox. For nearly seven years, that nigger's been roaming the woods, defying the law,"" said Brother Roach.

Brother Brannum agreed but with reluctance. Blue Dave was a legendary figure, a terror to all. His elusive nature made him a mystery, and many attributed supernatural powers to him. He was a giant in folklore, an evil spirit. People feared him, and any mischief was blamed on Blue Dave. He was a creature of mystery and fear, leaving a lasting impression on the community."|"1.
