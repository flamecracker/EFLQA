"Dave suggested walking together to share what he knew about the Pollard submarine boats. These boats, owned by the government, caught the attention of the Navy officers. Jack Benson, along with his friends, showed great skill in handling submarines at the Farnum shipyard. They were even offered positions by European governments, but the U.S. Navy wanted to keep them. The Navy Secretary offered them ranks as officers without commissions until they turned twenty-one. The Submarine Boys, as they were known, were admired for their contributions to the country. They were at the Naval Academy to instruct the first classmen on the latest Pollard submarine, the ""Dodger."" Although some midshipmen were older than them, the Submarine Boys were humble and helpful during the instruction. Submarine war craft like the Pollard boats were seen as crucial for future naval wars, sparking interest among the midshipmen."|"1.

"Starting the next day, the ""Dodger"" would guide six midshipmen on Chesapeake Bay to teach them about submarine operations above and below the water's surface.

The midshipmen eagerly discussed the ""Dodger"" and its officers, known as a top submarine. Benson emphasized the importance of quick actions and crew independence for effective submarine operations. The crew's role was to act swiftly and independently, maintaining a clear view of the deck and sea. The ""Dodger"" prioritized light steering for steady nerves during critical moments. In case of pursuit, the submarine could evade detection by diving underwater, while also being capable of chasing down faster ships if needed."|"1.
