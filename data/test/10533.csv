This fascinating individual, despite his flaws, headed to Paris, the French intellectual hub, at just twenty years old after gaining provincial acclaim.

Paganism valued physical arts over intellectual pursuits, rewarding athletes and poets who catered to sensory pleasures. Women, in particular, were undervalued, with their intellect and soul often neglected.

Christianity, in earnest, worked to save souls neglected by Paganism. Women, thus, began to rise and shine in a new light, with increased charm, moral beauty, and power. This moral beauty, seated in the soul, radiated a defense against wrath and passion. It protected women and commanded respect. Christianity's efforts, however, led to mistakes. Monasteries and convents were established to shield against degrading influences. Monasticism emphasized abstinence, virginity, simplicity, and meditation to overcome temptations. Piety found solace in monastic retreats, fostering a dreamy, introspective mood. Despite its flaws, the aim was noble. Saint Theresa, a remarkable figure, flourished in this environment. Nuns in those times were known for their charity and education. The fervor of religion then, unmatched today, exemplifies the intensity and zeal of Saint Theresa's era.|"1.

Saint Theresa was born in Avila, Spain, in 1515, a time still deeply rooted in medieval customs and beliefs. She came from a noble family known for their piety and virtue. Her parents instilled in her the values of Catholicism, emphasizing charity, truthfulness, and kindness. Despite the intellectual advancements of the time, Spain remained staunchly Catholic, untouched by the Reformation. Theresa's early fascination with martyrdom led her to consider extreme actions, like fleeing to Africa to face death at the hands of the Moors. Her parents thwarted these plans, and she turned to a more secluded life, even contemplating becoming a nun. Despite her initial worldly interests, Theresa's encounters with the nuns at a convent and her uncle's teachings led her to eventually embrace a life of religious devotion, born out of fear rather than love due to the prevailing beliefs of eternal damnation.|"1.

Saint Theresa's reformation of the Carmelite order stands out as extraordinary. Unlike convents of her time, the nuns didn't seek riches from the wealthy to live in luxury.

Around 1706, the Whigs and Tories were deeply embroiled in conflict. The intensity of their rivalry during the early 18th century is hard to grasp today. This feud tore families apart and filled the nation with rumors and plots. Both party leaders were elitist and resistant to change, holding the common people in disdain. Their battle was primarily for power and profit. The sole difference was that one group secretly supported the exiled royal family and opposed the French war, while the other was more staunchly Protestant and favored continuing the war. Harley, a key Tory figure, was known for his cunning and influence, even though some critics questioned his intellect. He saw the rising power of literary figures like Swift and supported them. Harley despised the Duchess of Marlborough and worked to diminish her sway over the Queen. He believed England should focus on naval warfare and harbored a strong dislike for the Dutch, wealthy individuals, and Dissenters. By skillfully using his cousin, Abigail Hill, Harley managed to undermine the Duchess's position and influence with the Queen, ultimately achieving his political goals.|"1.

"Critics do not approve of historical novels because they are not entirely history or fiction. They can mislead readers and may not be as engaging as the works of Macaulay and Froude.

The novel's primary characters, Romola and Tito, epitomize the Renaissance era, a time more influenced by Paganism than Christianity.

"""Daniel Deronda"" by George Eliot is often seen as a failure by critics despite occasional brilliance. The extensive focus on the Jewish characters is not considered artistic, and the subject may not interest the English due to deep-rooted prejudices. The Hebrew people, also known as the Jews, have maintained their traditions and excelled in various fields like scholarship, statesmanship, and finance. However, the idea of Daniel Deronda uniting his scattered race is seen as unrealistic. The novel reflects George Eliot's somber philosophy, portraying characters like Mordecai as patient sufferers. The story unfolds with Mordecai's disciple embracing his Jewish heritage proudly. The heroine's misguided marriage for wealth leads to a life of regret until her husband's accidental demise. George Eliot's later work, ""Theophrastus Such,"" is noted for its cynical tone, a departure from her earlier style. Despite her literary achievements, George Eliot lived a secluded life, focusing on art, music, and her beliefs influenced by positivism."|"1. What is a reason why ""Daniel Deronda"" is often criticized by some critics?
A) Extensive focus on Jewish characters
B) Lack of character development
C) Unrealistic plot twists
D) Overuse of descriptive language
E) Lack of a clear storyline"|A) Extensive focus on Jewish characters|Yes
"""Daniel Deronda"" by George Eliot is often seen as a failure by critics despite occasional brilliance. The extensive focus on the Jewish characters is not considered artistic, and the subject may not interest the English due to deep-rooted prejudices. The Hebrew people, also known as the Jews, have maintained their traditions and excelled in various fields like scholarship, statesmanship, and finance. However, the idea of Daniel Deronda uniting his scattered race is seen as unrealistic. The novel reflects George Eliot's somber philosophy, portraying characters like Mordecai as patient sufferers. The story unfolds with Mordecai's disciple embracing his Jewish heritage proudly. The heroine's misguided marriage for wealth leads to a life of regret until her husband's accidental demise. George Eliot's later work, ""Theophrastus Such,"" is noted for its cynical tone, a departure from her earlier style. Despite her literary achievements, George Eliot lived a secluded life, focusing on art, music, and her beliefs influenced by positivism."|"2.
