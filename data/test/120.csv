At around half past one, which is three bells in sea terms, the HISPANIOLA sent two boats ashore. In the cabin, the captain, the squire, and I discussed our situation. If there had been a breeze, we would have dealt with the six mutineers on board, hoisted the anchor, and sailed away. But the wind was absent, leaving us stranded. To make matters worse, Hunter arrived with news that Jim Hawkins had sneaked into a boat and joined the others ashore. We never doubted Jim, but we worried for his safety. With the crew's volatile state, it was uncertain if Jim would return. We rushed to the deck. The tar was bubbling in the seams, and the foul odor made me queasy. The six rascals were grumbling under a sail on the forecastle; on land, we could see the boats secured with a man in each, near the river's mouth. One of them was whistling “Lillibullero.”|"1.

"Hunter and I steered straight towards the stockade, while the guards at the boats seemed puzzled by our approach. They hesitated, possibly debating whether to inform Silver. Instead, they stayed put and resumed singing ""Lillibullero."" I navigated to keep the coast between us and the gigs, eventually landing near a spring atop a knoll. Surrounding the spring was a sturdy loghouse, fortified and well-equipped to fend off attackers. What caught my attention was the spring itself, a precious resource we lacked on the ship. Suddenly, a cry of distress echoed across the island, signaling danger. Without hesitation, I rushed back to the shore, boarded the jolly-boat, and prepared it with supplies and weapons. Despite the risks, we made a second trip to provision the blockhouse, a bold move that could have ended in disaster. But with our resolve and preparedness, we managed to secure the cargo and return safely to the ship."|"1. What resource did the narrator find near the loghouse?

The squire was waiting for me at the back window, looking much better. He secured the boat and we hurried to load it with provisions like pork, powder, and biscuits.

As the captain mentioned, the cold was gone. When the sun rose above the trees, it shone brightly on the clearing, drying up the moisture quickly. The sand became hot, and the resin in the logs of the block house began to melt. Everyone removed their jackets and coats, rolled up their sleeves, and stood ready, feeling the intense heat and tension. We listened intently and scanned the surroundings for any signs of danger. Suddenly, Joyce fired his musket, followed by a volley of shots from all sides of the enclosure. Bullets hit the log-house, but none penetrated it. The attackers were silent, hidden. The captain anticipated an assault from the north, while shots were fired sporadically from the east and west. Pirates emerged from the north, leaping over the fence towards us. The attack intensified, with gunfire from the woods. The pirates closed in on us, and chaos ensued as they breached our defenses.

I followed orders and turned to the east, holding my sword up, and dashed around the corner. Suddenly, I faced Anderson, who yelled and raised his weapon in the sunlight. Without time to fear, I dodged to the side, but slipped in the sand and tumbled down the slope. As I emerged from the house, the other mutineers were climbing the fence to attack us. Gray swiftly defeated the boatswain, and the doctor took down another. The battle was swift, and we emerged victorious. The attackers retreated, leaving behind fallen comrades. We tended to the wounded and mourned our losses. The mutineers dwindled in number as we secured our position. The captain, injured but stable, remarked on the improved odds.

After dinner, the squire and the doctor talked with the captain. The doctor then prepared to leave, taking his gear and heading into the woods. Meanwhile, I envied the doctor's cool walk while I sweated in the heat. I decided to sneak out to explore the island. I filled my pockets with biscuits, planning to search for a hidden boat. I slipped away when no one was watching, heading towards the east coast. I reached the shore, hearing the sea's roar and feeling the cool breeze. The sea was never calm around Treasure Island. As I approached a white rock, the sun set, and fog rolled in. I had to find the boat quickly. Night fell as I reached the rock, discovering a tent made of goat-skins in a hidden dell.|"1.

I found Ben Gunn's boat in a hollow. It was a small, homemade boat made of tough wood with a goat-skin covering. The boat was so tiny that it seemed it could barely hold a man. It had one low thwart, a stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle. It resembled an ancient Briton's coracle, light and portable. I planned to cut the HISPANIOLA loose to prevent the mutineers from escaping. As darkness fell, I set the coracle on the water. The boat was tricky to handle but buoyant. I managed to reach the anchored ship, the HISPANIOLA, by following the tide. However, cutting the hawser to set the ship adrift was risky due to the strong current. Luckily, a change in the wind helped slacken the hawser, giving me a chance to proceed with my plan.|"1. What material was Ben Gunn's boat made of?

I decided to act decisively, using my knife to cut the remaining strands holding the vessel. While I worked, I overheard loud voices from the cabin, belonging to Israel Hands, the coxswain, and my friend in the red night-cap, both clearly intoxicated. They were arguing fiercely, with oaths and threats filling the air. Despite their drunken state, they managed to avoid physical violence for the time being. Meanwhile, on the shore, a campfire glowed warmly as someone sang a melancholic sailor's song. As the coracle drifted towards the HISPANIOLA, I noticed a light cord trailing from the ship. Curiosity got the better of me, and I peered through the cabin window, witnessing a violent struggle between Hands and his companion.

They were arguing fiercely, with oaths and threats filling the air. Despite their drunken state, they managed to avoid physical violence for the time being. Meanwhile, on the shore, a campfire glowed warmly as someone sang a melancholic sailor's song. As the coracle drifted towards the HISPANIOLA, I noticed a light cord trailing from the ship. Curiosity got the better of me, and I peered through the cabin window, witnessing a violent struggle between Hands and his companion. The ship's sudden change in direction and increased speed startled me, hinting at more trouble ahead.|"4. What was the mood of the sailor's song being sung on the shore?

I woke up and saw ripples around me, glowing slightly in the dark. The HISPANIOLA ship swayed, and I noticed it veering southward. Glancing back, I saw the campfire's glow. The current turned sharply, carrying the ship and coracle towards the open sea. The ship suddenly veered, causing a commotion onboard. I crouched in the coracle, fearing for my life as we sped through the narrows. Exhausted, I succumbed to sleep, dreaming of safety. Upon waking, I found myself near Treasure Island, with cliffs and rough seas ahead. Sea lions barked on the rocks, deterring me from landing. Opting to head north to Cape of the Woods, I navigated the coracle cautiously, riding the waves with newfound confidence.|"1. What caused the ship to veer suddenly, creating a commotion onboard?

I was soaked and scared, falling back into my old spot on the coracle. It seemed to steer gently through the waves, ignoring any attempts to change its course. I was petrified but kept my composure. Carefully, I bailed out water with my cap. Observing the waves closely, I noticed their peaks and valleys. The coracle maneuvered through them, avoiding the steep slopes. I decided to lie still and occasionally paddle towards land. Slowly, I made progress towards the Cape of the Woods, battling thirst and exhaustion. Suddenly, I spotted the HISPANIOLA sailing nearby. As it changed direction erratically, I realized there was no one steering. Inspired by the adventure, I contemplated boarding the ship to return it to its crew.

I rose from the water, greeted by a spray cloud, determined to chase after the unsteered HISPANIOLA. Despite rough seas, I paddled on, gaining on the ship. The schooner seemed deserted or its crew drunk below. The ship's sails caused it to drift away, but a moment came when it turned, offering me a chance. I leaped onto the bowsprit as the schooner struck my coracle, leaving me stranded. The ship's jib flapped, and I saw the empty deck, marked by mutiny.

Two watchmen were on the ship, one with a red cap and stiff posture, and the other, Israel Hands, looking weak with his chin down. The ship rocked like a wild horse, sails filling on different tacks, and the boom swinging. Sprays of water hit the ship's bulwark, and heavy blows were felt as the ship rode the waves. Despite the rough seas, the watchmen remained unmoved. The ship was in disarray, lockfast places broken, and the floor muddy from ruffians. Barrels and bottles were missing or empty, showing signs of a mutiny. I found some brandy and food for Hands and took a drink before offering him the brandy. Hands mentioned the dead man, O'Brien, and offered to teach me to sail the ship in exchange for food, drink, and a bandage for his wound.|"1. What was the condition of the ship during the rough seas?

It made sense to me, and we quickly agreed. In no time, the HISPANIOLA sailed smoothly along the coast of Treasure Island. The plan was to reach the northern point before noon, turn back to North Inlet, beach safely, and wait for the tide to land.

I hurried down the ship's stairs making as much noise as possible, slipped off my shoes, tiptoed along the gallery, climbed the ladder to the forecastle, and peeked out cautiously. I knew he wouldn't expect to see me there, so I took every precaution. Unfortunately, my worst suspicions were confirmed. He had a knife stained with blood. It was clear he intended harm.

I hurried forward and peered down. It seemed shallow enough, and clutching the cut rope securely, I cautiously lowered myself overboard.

He seemed cunning and said, ""It’s lucky you have Barbecue to think for you. I got what I wanted. They have the ship. Once we find the treasure, we’ll have the upper hand.""

As for the hostage, Silver mentioned, ""I’ll take him with us when we hunt for treasure. We’ll keep him safe like gold. Once we have the ship and treasure, we’ll talk to Mr. Hawkins and give him his share.""

The men were in good spirits, but I was disheartened. If"|"6. What did Silver imply about the treasure hunt and their chances of success?

"The men on the island were carrying various supplies like picks, shovels, pork, bread, and brandy from the ship. They set out to the beach with broken equipment due to the pirates' drunkenness.

Ever since they found the skeleton and began discussing it, their voices grew quieter until they were almost whispering, barely disturbing the silence of the woods.

But the voice called out again, this time with a distant cry for rum. The pirates were terrified, unable to comprehend the mysterious voice.

"Their moods improved remarkably, and color returned to their faces. They chatted and listened as they walked, with Merry leading the way using Silver's compass towards Skeleton Island.
