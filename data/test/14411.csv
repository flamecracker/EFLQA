Today, it is snowing outside. Did you know that in just one square mile, one foot of snow would weigh a whopping 65,000 tons? Imagine this: if you were to load a ton of snow onto each sled and line them up with horses, the procession of sleds carrying the snow could stretch all the way from Philadelphia to New York and even further up the Hudson River towards Albany. And that's just from one square mile! There are thousands of square miles covered in snow every winter. But have you ever wondered how snow forms? It starts as tiny flakes, falling one by one.

The larger nails represent young adults and mature individuals, showing how important it is to heed positive calls early in life. Lastly, the rusty, large nail symbolizes a life deep in sin, needing a strong and loving call to turn towards goodness. So, it's best to respond to positive influences early and eagerly, just like the man who sought a better life for his family during a famine long ago.|"1. What is the main idea of the text?
