While the father left, I stood back, observing eagerly as many beavers gathered around him, helping to push him onto the dam where he lay. We were anxious to know if our friend was recovering or had passed away. Father and I decided to investigate by creeping out onto the dam.

Last spring, I visited the colony and found our friend, still in charge but with a crooked back from a lion attack. We shared a special moment, and father was so moved that he secured a protected reserve for the beavers. Polly shared the story of bringing the beaver home, and the day ended with the girls preparing for the arrival of young visitors the next day. Their bond deepened, marking a lasting friendship without envy or quarrels.|"1. What did the beavers do when the father was pushed onto the dam?

Anne liked the idea of Eleanor accompanying her eastward, while Polly remained silent, hoping someone would convince her mother that it was the right choice for her as well. Saturday arrived, and everyone at Pebbly Pit eagerly awaited the return of the adventurers, expecting them not to spend another Sunday on the mountain. In the late afternoon, the sound of horses' hooves announced their arrival, and soon they were at the door. John explained that they had successfully completed their mission, taking photographs of the area for potential investors. Tom discussed the challenges of mining due to a recent landslide but shared a theory to mitigate future risks. The group eagerly awaited news on Choko's Find and the plans devised by Mr. Brewster and the engineers.|"6. What did Tom discuss with the group?
A) Cooking recipes

The Courts have ruled in favor of Dr. Evans retaining the patent rights, allowing the company to proceed with their plans. If the company can find affordable materials for mining without excessive costs for equipment, they will establish a close corporation promptly. However, if mining the required stones demands substantial capital, the original members may need to sell half their rights to fund the project. Do you understand so far? When I first visited Pebbly Pit with John, I saw the vibrant stones at Rainbow Cliffs. Despite urging Mr. Brewster to send samples to my father for Dr. Evans' machine, my friend failed to grasp the opportunity. I informed my father about the unmined stones at Rainbow Cliffs, but progress halted due to an injunction. A surprising telegram from Oak Creek revealed Polly's claim to a gold mine, prompting us to rush there. To develop Choko's Find, substantial funding is crucial due to safety concerns and potential obstacles in mining. Polly and Eleanor may need to secure additional capital, potentially through stock sales or royalty agreements. Maintaining a controlling share in the company is advisable. Transporting ore from the mine to the railroad will require significant investment in infrastructure. Sam Brewster's company, with experience at Rainbow Cliffs, could provide capital for the venture. Collaboration between the Evans' Jewel Cutting Company and the Polly-Eleanor Company is envisioned for mutual benefit, with shared ownership ensuring fair dealings between the mines.|"1.

Jim mentioned that they were currently at Silver Creek with only a week left of work there before moving on to the next section near Buffalo Park. He also inquired about Old Montresor's cabin at that location. Jim then invited the girls to join them for a weekend at camp, where the Boss's wife, Mrs. Carew, would be the hostess. He explained that Mrs. Carew usually spends Sundays at camp unless the Boss visits her in town. They planned to wait for updates on the stones sent to New York and the financing of Choko's Find.

Jim mentioned that they were currently at Silver Creek with only a week left of work there before moving on to the next section near Buffalo Park. He also inquired about Old Montresor's cabin at that location. Jim then invited the girls to join them for a weekend at camp, where the Boss's wife, Mrs. Carew, would be the hostess. He explained that Mrs. Carew usually spends Sundays at camp unless the Boss visits her in town. They planned to wait for updates on the stones sent to New York and the financing of Choko's Find. John expressed his satisfaction at the prospect of his dad and Dr. Evans visiting. Anne smiled at John's excitement. Mrs. Brewster and Tom Latimer shared a knowing look.
