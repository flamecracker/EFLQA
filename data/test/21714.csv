As most on deck dozed, the cook, Nikel Sling, was wide awake, bustling about his galley. Being the first up, he faced the same mess left from the night before. A cook's life seemed full of constant challenges and frustrations. Beside him sat Tim Rokens, enduring the heat to light his pipe. They chatted about spotting fish as the ship sailed on. Suddenly, the cry ""Thar she blows"" shattered the tranquility. The crew sprang into action, readying the boats for the whale sighting. Legs swung out of hammocks, heads popped up, and the men rushed on deck, eager for the hunt. The captain urged them on as they readied the boats for the chase."|"1.

"""A group of them!"" whispered Ailie, who had left her spot at the mizzen-shrouds, standing by her father's side, watching the sudden commotion in utter surprise. ""Do whales attend school?"" she chuckled. The starboard, larboard, and waist-boats swiftly descended, with the sailors quickly boarding, taking their places and grabbing their oars.

The captain urged them on, shouting encouragement as the boats cut through the water towards the nearest whale. The men rowed with all their might, their backs bent, arms straining, and oars slicing through the sea with determination. Glynn, new to the task, put in every effort, almost breaking the oar in his eagerness to contribute to the chase.

A massive sperm whale floated lazily a quarter mile ahead, as the starboard boat raced towards it, leaving the others behind. More whales appeared, forming a school around them. The whale-men steered towards the closer ones. The whale raised its tail and dove, coloring the sea red with its blood. It resurfaced near the boat, prompting a quick retreat to avoid its powerful flukes. The whale dived, pulling the line through the chocks. After a struggle, it resurfaced and was harpooned twice. In its agony, the whale thrashed, turning the sea red. It charged towards the boat but was repelled by a lance thrust. Mortally wounded, the whale succumbed, and the men towed it back to the ship, celebrating their hard-earned victory.|"1.

Before the whales arrived, the ship's decks were spotless, reflecting Captain Dunning's pride in cleanliness. However, once the whales were hauled in, the decks became smeared with grease, oil, and blood. Ailie, taken aback by the sudden change, had to witness the mess as the crew began the process of cutting up the whales for oil. Despite the filth, the crew had to carry on with their duties. Ailie, with a mix of wonder and disgust, gingerly navigated the slippery decks, bearing the foul smells. The crew attached ropes to the whales to begin the cutting process. The blubber was hoisted up and cut into pieces for boiling down into oil. The scene on deck, with flames and smoke from the try-works, was both striking and eerie. Ailie observed the men at work, surrounded by a chaotic yet fascinating sight of fire, oil, and smoke in the dark night.|"1.

The harm endured by the _Red Eric_ in the tempest was discovered to be more serious than initially thought. A part of her false keel had been ripped away by a submerged rock, which the ship had glided over so lightly that no one aboard noticed. However, it was forceful enough to cause the harm mentioned. A minor leak was also found, and fixing the top of the foremast took longer than expected. This led to the ship being stuck on the African coast for almost two weeks. During this time, Ailie explored the land with Glynn, Tim, and her father, immersing herself in a world of wonder and romance. Despite encountering some distressing sights and stories, she focused on the beauty around her, pondering the purpose of God's creations.
