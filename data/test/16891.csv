Philadelphia, the final city mentioned, is known as the great Quaker city. Its streets are noted for their orderly layout, while the houses and stores stand out for their cleanliness. Most public buildings are made of white marble. The city is famous for its numerous charitable institutions and religious structures, making it a bustling business hub.

Once, a black man wanted to get an Opossum from a hollow tree. He cut a hole too low and had to smoke the animal out. The tree was thin, and it seemed like it would fall, but the black man climbed it fearlessly. When the Opossum appeared half-singed, he triumphantly threw it down. This scene in the forest was powerful. The island has mountains, forests, rivers, and meadows, making it valuable. Two rivers, Tamar and Derwent, cross the island. Hobart Town, the capital, sits on the Derwent. British settlements in Australia, like Sydney, Tasmania, Port Phillip, Melbourne, and Victoria, have grown rapidly. The discovery of gold caused a frenzy, with people abandoning their jobs to search for gold. Melbourne's population skyrocketed from 23,000 to 85,000 in a year due to the gold rush. An obelisk in the International Exhibition represents the gold Australia sent to the UK since 1851, totaling nearly 800 tons. The interior of Australia remains largely unexplored. An expedition led by Burke aimed to cross the continent but ended tragically with Burke and his companions starving to death.
