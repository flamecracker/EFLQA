Randy retired early and woke around half-past eleven at night. He dressed, grabbed some hot chocolate prepared for the sentries, and joined the guard detail from midnight until 4 a.m. The post he took over from Ned Lowe was on the far side of the camp near cliffs overlooking the bay. It was a lonely night with overcast skies and moaning winds. Randy patrolled his post slowly, meeting other guards at each end. One guard, Codfish, seemed scared and avoided walking close to the trees. As it started to rain, Randy put on his raincoat, only to see someone stealing it. Convinced it was Werner or Glutts, Randy chased after the figure and struck them with his gun. As the rain passed, the morning stars appeared, signaling the end of Randy's watch. But strange clanking and chain rattling noises interrupted the quiet night, making Randy pause to listen.|"1. What did Randy do during the night shift?

The cadets quickly reached the spot where Randy had seen the two strangers. Surprisingly, they found a faint trail leading north and south through the forest. Following the path was challenging, weaving among trees and bushes, and sometimes over rough rocks. They stumbled upon a steel bar that appeared to be part of an airplane. Carrying the bar, they continued along the trail to a larger path with wagon tracks and horse hoofs. The road led to rocks overlooking Barlight Bay. Returning, they found themselves on the highway they had marched to camp on. Despite searching for footprints, they found none. Local authorities and a Secret Service agent examined the steel bar.

Andy, Randy, and Spouter were tasked with returning to Camp Barlight promptly to inform Captain Dale of their findings. Meanwhile, Jack, Fred, and Gif remained vigilant in case the Germans attempted any sudden movements.

As the twins and Spouter left to report to Captain Dale, Jack and his companions observed the Germans, heavy-set individuals who spoke in German. The Germans worked on the submarine for nearly an hour, causing a racket that eventually ceased, leaving an eerie silence in the cavern. The Germans emerged from the submarine, changed into street clothes, and the cavern grew dim as most lights were turned off. Fred speculated that the entrance was underwater, explaining why the location remained hidden for so long. The group noticed the smell of gasoline and the distant sound of waves breaking nearby.|"1.
