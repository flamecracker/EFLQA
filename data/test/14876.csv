"Kentucky had no lakes, and Paul knew little about them. As they hurried forward, Paul thought more about the lake than Henry's mysterious words, ""We're going to live in it."" Upon reaching the lake's edge, Paul gasped in delight. The lake was a magnificent half-moon shape, about seven miles long and two miles wide at its center. In the widest part stood a beautiful wooded island with towering trees. Surrounding the lake were high hills covered in lush forests. The beauty of the scene touched everyone, even uneducated men like Shif'less Sol and Jim Hart. They all stood in awe, gazing at the lake and the wooded island as the sinking sun painted the waters silver and the trees with a fiery glow. Shif'less Sol closed his eyes briefly, savoring the heavenly moment, before the boat reached the island. Paul, too, felt the enchantment of the island and the darkening lake but kept his ghostly fears at bay. As they hid the boat and settled on the island, Henry revealed that it was an ancient burial ground, believed to be haunted by the spirits of the departed. Despite the eerie history, they all settled down to rest, lulled by the gentle wind under the starlit sky, ready to uncover more mysteries in the days ahead."|"1.

"In the evening, the group made plans for the next day. Henry and Sol were set to leave for the mainland for a deer hunt, leaving Long Jim in charge at home. Paul, although tempted to join the hunters, had his own idea. He decided to craft a large bag from buckskin using a homemade needle and deer tendon as thread. With the bag slung over his shoulder, Paul headed north to gather hickory nuts from the grove near the water. He cracked the nuts open, enjoying their flavor, and collected several bushels. Returning home, Paul proudly displayed his harvest and set out to gather more. Throughout the morning, he worked diligently, accumulating a substantial quantity of nuts by the wall.

He went down the path to the door of the cabin, and halted a moment there. A red gleam, a glow from the bed of coals, came through a chink beside the door, and it filled his heart with terror. He shivered, and fear drew a low growl from him. One of the five sleepers inside stirred and sat up. He listened and heard a heavy breathing at the door.
