The journey had been long and arduous, covering about forty miles each day as they moved from one battleground to the next.

The region had been plagued by these predators, causing harm to livestock and even attacking people. The wolves had multiplied due to harsh winters and ongoing conflicts in other areas. After this successful mission, there was hope that the wolves would stay away for some time. Upon his return, Beric was surprised to find a Druid in deep conversation with his mother, discussing urgent matters regarding the Roman governor's plans to eradicate their religion and oppress their people.

The council met with lively discussions. Most chiefs preferred avoiding the challenging position and targeting easier places for conquest. The British warriors mainly fought for riches. After the initial rampage at Camalodunum, they now craved the spoils of Roman cities. The chiefs argued against risking more lives and planned to march towards Verulamium and then London. Beric supported an immediate attack, but the majority favored delaying the assault on Roman garrisons until after defeating Suetonius. Beric and Aska discussed the uncertainty of the upcoming battle's outcome. The tribes eventually captured and destroyed Verulamium, deciding to march west to gather more allies before facing Suetonius. However, they later learned that Suetonius had bypassed them, prompting a change in plans. Beric regretted not attacking the Roman garrisons individually to weaken Suetonius' forces.|"1.
