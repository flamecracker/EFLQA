When the Association was established, rustlers were few and mainly focused on branding unmarked yearlings with their own symbols. Because State laws required brands to be registered for ownership, rustlers believed they had rights to their brands like legitimate cowmen. As long as the yearlings were unbranded, it was hard to stop them. But as rustlers increased, they became bolder, altering brands and forging documents. The Association banned cowmen involved with rustlers, leading some to join the rustling business. Rustlers faced challenges as the Live Stock Association closely monitored cattle markets, confiscating rustler's cattle unless proven legitimate. With markets closed off, rustlers resorted to butchering their cattle or driving them to Montana. Despite challenges, rustlers showed exceptional horsemanship and cattle-handling skills. Young Sterry, working for the Live Stock Association, investigated rustler operations, risking his life to combat rustling activities across Wyoming and Montana.|"1.
