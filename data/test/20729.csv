The tale of the war that shattered the mighty Mahratta confederacy is a gripping chapter in the series of battles that, initiated by Clive, culminated in firmly establishing our grand dominion in the Indian Peninsula. At the outset of the conflict, the Mahrattas held sway over a considerable expanse of India, stretching from Bombay to Delhi and extending from Rajputana to Allahabad. Their domain also encompassed the region of Cuttack in the south, effectively dividing Madras from Calcutta. The internal rivalries among the Mahratta leaders, Holkar and Scindia, along with their conflicts with the Peishwa at Poona, greatly aided the British forces. These divisions enabled the British to liberate a significant portion of India from the Mahrattas, a people characterized by treachery, cruelty, and a lack of valor in the face of British military might.|"1.

It is alarming that their progress is so slow. The entire operation has been a terrible mistake. To burden a force of four thousand soldiers with around thirty thousand camp followers and a train of nineteen thousand bullocks is the most absurd thing I have ever heard of. The mismanagement is evident. The conduct of the Mahrattas has been questionable, and the Governor General and Council in Calcutta strongly disapprove of the Council in Bombay. The actions in supporting Rugoba, who was involved in nefarious activities, were highly criticized. The situation worsened as a regency was formed under Gunga Bye, the widow of the murdered Peishwa, leading to conflicting loyalties. The decision to assist Rugoba was ill-conceived, and the subsequent capture of Salsette and Tannah further escalated tensions. The force's slow progress and excessive baggage make success highly unlikely in the face of the united Mahratta confederacy. The Major and his subordinate discuss the precarious situation, hoping for a positive outcome despite the unfavorable circumstances.|"1. What is the main concern regarding the progress of the force?
A) Inadequate training
B) Excessive baggage
C) Lack of supplies
D) Unfavorable weather conditions
E) Poor communication"|B) Excessive baggage|Yes

In the historical events of the Mahratta War, there was a significant disagreement between Cockburn and Captain Hartley regarding the feasibility of a retreat. Despite Hartley's proposed plan, the committee decided to send Mr. Holmes to finalize a treaty they never intended to honor. Scindia took a leading role in negotiations, overshadowing Nana Furnuwees.

I arrived on the first ship after the Governor of Bombay received your letter. Due to contrary winds, our voyage took nearly two months. I briefly landed in Madras and heard of your return. I debated whether to seek your orders or join General Harris at Vellore. Opting to come directly, I re-embarked on the ship that had just anchored. The dinner was quiet, attended only by the Governor General's officers. The Governor welcomed me warmly, acknowledging my service in the Deccan. He praised my role in securing the release of Nana Furnuwees, a friend of ours. Despite Nana's loyalty, the Peishwa's duplicity poses a threat. Lord Mornington plans to engage with the Rajah of Berar, a potential ally against the Mahrattas and Tippoo. He entrusts me with this mission, providing detailed instructions and an escort for the journey.|"1. What was the reason for the nearly two-month voyage mentioned in the text?

It was almost two weeks before Harry received another message from the rajah. The rajah had returned Harry's visit and sent gifts of sweets and food to his guests. One evening, he arrived with only two attendants, expressing his concerns about the English and their intentions in India. The rajah's ministers were divided on whether to ally with or fight against Tippoo, who had been ruthless towards Hindus in his territory. The rajah believed that an alliance with the English could be beneficial, but he needed material gains to convince his council. The rajah proposed a significant demand, which Harry found excessive. Despite this, the rajah was open to negotiations and concessions. Harry sent messengers to seek instructions and buy time, hoping for military successes against Tippoo to sway the rajah's terms. The rajah, unsure of his stance, awaited developments, while the English armies prepared for the siege of Tippoo's capital.|"1.

While this event unfolded, Harry's group of soldiers worked diligently to remove the paving stones from the yard and piled them against the gate. The lower windows were secured with bars, and with the only entrance through the front gate, they believed they could defend the house for a significant period. As soon as the guards were dispersed, part of the crowd began pelting the gate with stones, accompanied by a heavy barrage of gunfire aimed at every window. The intensity of the attack led Harry to keep his troopers out of sight behind the stone barricades near the gate, ready to return fire once the gate was breached. Harry wished he had immediately ordered his men to mount and cut through the mob upon his return from the rajah. He anticipated that even if some managed to escape, they would likely face pursuit. Realizing the dire situation, Harry understood that unless the rajah intervened, they would likely be overwhelmed. He was confident that the massacre of a British envoy and his escort would prompt the English troops to come to Nagpore eventually, regardless of the rajah's efforts to save them. The house was situated in a garden, with horses tethered at the rear. Harry directed half his men to breach the mud wall at the garden's end to create an escape route.

Just before ten o'clock, a group of two hundred men prepared to launch an attack. The leader of the group was the rajah, and Harry was in charge of the firing team.

Fairclough decided to keep a few men working that afternoon to set up night fishing lines. The crew planned to preserve the fish they caught to reduce reliance on their food supplies. By evening, the new fore-top mast was successfully installed. With the major task completed, a boat crew, led by Mr. Eden, was to explore the coast the next morning for freshwater sources. They were instructed to head south where higher land indicated a better chance of finding streams. The crew, armed for safety, was to cover around twenty miles and return if they found no water source. The crew set out early the next day, and after a short sail, they discovered a stream flowing into the sea, bringing cheers from the sailors. Fairclough emphasized caution to avoid encounters with potentially hostile natives. The crew worked diligently to repair the ship, using canvas and pitch due to limited supplies, while the news of a nearby freshwater source lifted spirits and improved their working conditions.|"1.

Fifty cannons started firing at the gate to provide cover for the advancing men. The defenders at the gate responded with their own cannons, targeting the infantry. Despite heavy musket fire, the infantry, armed with ladders, tried to climb the wall. The Sepoys on the wall kept up a constant musket fire and repelled the attackers with bayonets. Holkar's men, expecting a surprise attack, soon retreated in disappointment, leaving their ladders behind. The garrison stayed on alert, anticipating another attack. However, Holkar's army was spotted marching away on the 15th, and Lord Lake arrived on the 18th. Harry, who had ridden to Sekerah the day before Holkar's army approached, urged the local rajah to send troops to aid in the city's defense. The rajah, believing Holkar would easily conquer the city, sided with him, showing his true intentions once Harry arrived at his palace. Despite the tense situation, Harry remained calm and diplomatic, attempting to reason with the rajah. Unfortunately, the encounter took a dangerous turn, leading to a confrontation in the courtyard.|"6. When did Lord Lake arrive in the city?

Harry was quickly tied up and placed on a horse with ten locals escorting him out of town. After a three-hour ride, they reached a hill fort on a high rock.

Harry's arms were untied, and the governor and soldiers left, locking the door behind them. Harry pondered his situation, hoping that if Holkar didn't capture Delhi, there might be a chance for him. He realized the rajah was likely observing the situation. Looking out from the tower, Harry saw the fort's defenses and the courtyard below.

Despite initial failures, additional batteries were set up, and a sustained cannonade led to the creation of a new breach. To gather vital information, disguised soldiers rode out to scout the ditch's width. Portable bridges were then prepared for a daylight assault. However, the garrison had flooded the moat, thwarting the attack and resulting in heavy casualties. Despite setbacks, the British forces regrouped, establishing closer batteries and advancing their trenches. By February 20th, preparations were made for a more strategic assault to overcome the fortress.|"1.
