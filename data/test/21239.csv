Upon first glance, your eyes would be drawn to the valley below, a striking contrast to the rugged surroundings. The valley's shape hints at being an ancient volcano crater, now a lush landscape with park-like plains, rock mounds, and a central lake reflecting the snow-capped Chumulari summit. With a telescope, you could spot various animals and birds roaming and flying around. At one end, a white vapor rises from a hot spring near the lake, not smoke but steam. The valley beckons exploration, yet reaching it requires descending the cliffs using ropes. A gap in the cliffs leads to a glacier-filled gorge, impassable due to deep crevasses. In this secluded valley, you might find traces of past inhabitants - an empty stone hut with animal bones and skins. The cliff face reveals a series of ladders, hinting at an intriguing mystery waiting to be unraveled.|"1. What is the valley below described as in the text?

Upon first glance, it seems like the former inhabitants of the hut escaped the valley using ladders. However, the ladders don't reach the top of the cliff, making this exit impossible. There's a gap too wide to cross without more ladders. Where did they go? It's unlikely they were pulled up, and if they fell, they'd still be there. A quick look at the cliff shows the ledge is too narrow for more ladders. It's clear the plan failed. They must have been desperate, trapped in the valley with no way out. After exploring, it's unclear if they ever escaped. Your thoughts turn to who they were, how they got in and out, and if they made it out at all. These questions end once you read the story of the Cliff-climbers. Karl Linden, a German student exiled to London, found work in a nursery due to his botanical skills. He was sent to the Thibetan Himalayas to collect plants, accompanied by his brother Caspar and a guide named Ossaroo. Their journey led them to a valley from which they couldn't escape, facing dangers from wild animals and natural obstacles.|"1.

No. I had not gone further than this spot when I met Master Bruin. Our adventures with him and exploring the cave have kept us busy. Now, we can return to it. Our next step is to go around and see if we can find a better spot. It's too late tonight. Let's go back to our hut, have supper, and then rest. We can pray for success. We might wake up in better spirits and continue our search in the morning. Caspar and Ossaroo had no objections. They were hungry and eagerly got up at the mention of supper. After eating, they prayed for success and went to sleep with renewed hope. They were abruptly awakened by Fritz's barking. He rarely barked unnecessarily. This time, his bark was loud and continuous, indicating something serious. It seemed to come from near the lake. Caspar speculated that it might be an animal that could challenge Fritz, possibly a tiger. Karl shared his knowledge about tigers, mentioning that they could be found in regions farther north than expected. The noise resembled a trumpet but sharper and more eerie.|"1.

As the elephant turned its attention to Ossaroo, the friends ran for safety up a nearby tree. Ossaroo, realizing the danger he was in, made a daring escape by climbing back up the obelisk. The elephant, enraged by Ossaroo's actions, tried to reach him but only managed to tear his coat-tail off before he reached safety at the top of the obelisk.|"6.

One might have thought the elephant was trying to climb the obelisk, but it couldn't quite reach Ossaroo, the shikaree, who was perched on top. Ossaroo was in a perilous position as the elephant stood on its hind legs, trying to grab him with its trunk. The shikaree, though brave, struggled to keep his balance on the small space he stood on. He had to drop his spear and only had his knife to help him balance. Karl and Caspar, unable to help, watched anxiously from a tree. The elephant's attempts made the rock shake, adding to Ossaroo's challenge. Despite the danger, both brothers encouraged Ossaroo to stay strong. Karl, more aware of the situation, was deeply concerned about the trembling rock, fearing it could lead to disaster.|"1. What was Ossaroo's main challenge in the text?

The trio perched in the tree had a good reason to stay put patiently. They realized they had limited ammunition and decided to use it sparingly.

The hornbill is a fascinating bird known for its unique nesting habits. When the female hornbill is ready to lay eggs, she carefully selects a hollow tree large enough to accommodate her nest and her own body. Once the nest is built and the eggs are laid, she diligently sits on them until they hatch and the chicks are almost ready to fly. To protect the female during this vulnerable time, the male hornbill uses his beak to seal the nest entrance with mud. This ingenious design prevents predators like weasels and snakes from getting inside. The male hornbill's act of sealing the nest is essential for the safety of the female and her eggs. The hornbill's distinctive appearance, with its large beak and helmet-like protuberance, makes it easily recognizable. There are different species of hornbills, each with unique characteristics and habits, making them a fascinating subject for study.|"1. What is the main topic of the passage?

Karl knew a lot about the hornbill's behavior, but he didn't share it with his friends at that moment. They were all too busy observing the male bird. The male bird wasn't a herbivore; he landed with a piece of a dead snake in his beak meant for his mate. The female bird was ready for her meal, and the male deftly handed over the snake to her. After serving her, he flew off, possibly to bring dessert. The adventurers then turned their attention back to the elephant, waiting to see if it would leave. As they watched, they heard a soft, plaintive sound from the direction of the hornbill's nest. It wasn't a bird or human voice but a quadruped, resembling a raccoon but with distinct differences. The creature, known as _ailurus fulgens_, was a beautiful animal with a shiny coat. Karl recognized it and shared its scientific name with his friends.|"1.

"Karl was pleased to see the ""cheel"" growing close by. They could use it to make torches for light during dark nights. They quickly cut down slender trees for the ladder sides. They chose trees about fifty feet tall, which yielded thirty-foot lengths. Drilling holes for ladder rungs was the hardest part. They lacked tools, so Karl heated his pistol barrel to make a boring iron. It took many hours and days, causing sweat and tears, to burn out four hundred holes for the ladder rungs.

When Karl completed the unusual task he had set for himself, only a few steps remained to finish the ladder. Each pair of sides needed to be joined, the rounds inserted, and securely fastened at each end. Once done, a ladder was ready to be climbed. The ladders were raised one by one to their ledges, successfully scaling three-fourths of the cliff. Unfortunately, their climbing was abruptly halted when they reached a ledge that had a rock hanging over it, making it impossible to place a ladder there. Karl, realizing the insurmountable obstacle, sadly informed his companions. Disheartened and defeated, they sat in silence, gazing at the ladders they had painstakingly built, now rendered useless. The disappointment was profound, overshadowing the cold winter air and the dwindling food supplies at their hut. They trudged back home, resigned to the grim reality that they might never return.|"1.

With their ammunition destroyed, hunting for food became impossible. They faced the grim reality that they might not be able to survive in the valley without any means to procure food. As morning approached, they discussed alternative ways to sustain themselves, such as Ossaroo's hunting skills and Karl's plan to cultivate edible plants.

In summer, ibex migrate to high places for food, far from their winter homes. This journey starts when snow melts, moving gradually from hill to hill. Males stay in large groups, separate from females, resting during the day on snow beds or rocks. By evening, they head to grazing areas miles away, walking slowly at first, then trotting or running. They stay in high regions until October, then mix with females and descend to winter homes. Females wander less, some staying in the same area all year. Ibex are cautious, with sharp sight and smell, easily scared by humans or gunshots. They climb and leap over tough terrains swiftly. They are agile and enduring animals, capable of navigating challenging landscapes with ease.|"1. What is the main reason ibex migrate to high places in summer?

Upon first sight, the new ibex seemed to be sneaking up on the other, as if planning a cowardly attack to push it off the cliff! Indeed, this was his true intention, as revealed later. If the other ibex had stayed still for just six seconds longer, the attacker would have succeeded. Caspar's voice delayed the attack briefly, but not for long.

In the rugged Himalayan mountains, fierce battles between wild animals like the ibex, tahir, burrell, and Ovis ammon rams are common. These clashes often take place near steep cliffs, where the combatants risk being pushed over the edge. Surprisingly, the defeated animals can survive such falls, as seen when an ibex rebounded after an 80-yard drop without injury. Similarly, American bighorn sheep are known to perform incredible feats by leaping off cliffs and landing unharmed. While these stories may sound exaggerated, wild goats and sheep possess remarkable leaping abilities that defy belief. Nature equips these animals with unique adaptations that allow them to survive extreme falls. The adventurers in our story witness the aftermath of a dramatic ibex fall, unaware of the mysterious screams echoing from above, signaling the presence of other creatures in the rugged terrain.|"1.

The plan initially seemed feasible, but upon closer examination, two major obstacles emerged. The first challenge was whether the bearcoot could lift a rope strong enough to support a person climbing. The rope needed to be over 200 yards long and sturdy to endure the ascent. The second concern was if the rope could be secured at the top once the bearcoot carried it up. The group couldn't manage this alone; it would rely on chance. The team anticipated these issues and devised a solution. Crafting a high-quality rope became crucial. Ossaroo, skilled at spinning, was entrusted with this task. Their hemp stockpile was ready for use, and they had a suitable rope in hand, though not long enough. They needed a rope both strong enough for safety yet light enough for the bearcoot to carry.|"1.

The task was clear; they needed to determine the weight of two hundred yards of rope. A balance was swiftly set up with precision, almost as if they were weighing gold. They compared twenty yards of the rope to stones whose weight they had already measured with bullets, calculating the pounds and ounces. This process revealed that eight times the initial amount equaled one hundred and sixty yards, the estimated quantity needed. The next step was to test if the eagle could lift this weight. Despite initial hopes, the eagle struggled to lift the load, only managing to raise it slightly off the ground. After a few failed attempts, it became evident that the plan was unsuccessful. However, Caspar, having a solution in mind to shorten the rope, saw potential in the eagle yet.|"1. What was the main objective of the characters in the text?

The adventurers had a daring plan to use an eagle to escape the cliffs, but the attempt went awry. Ossaroo, the shikaree, lost control of the eagle, and it flew off with the rope trailing behind. Karl and Caspar were disappointed, thinking Ossaroo had failed. However, Ossaroo explained that he had to let go to avoid a dangerous leap. As they returned to their hut, Karl expressed a newfound appreciation for their humble shelter, calling it a true friend. Caspar, though, was homesick for the Bavarian Alps. Ossaroo longed for his bamboo hut and favorite foods. After supper, Caspar proposed using another bird for their escape plan, suggesting a Brahminy goose from the lake.

"Caspar and Karl were observing some birds circling above. Caspar was trying to guess the type of bird Karl was thinking of. Karl mentioned that the birds in the valley were mostly hawks, not of the same genus as eagles. As they watched two falcons, known as ""Churk"" falcons, circling Fritz, their dog, Caspar realized they were attacking him. The falcons swooped down in an attempt to steal Fritz's food, but he paid no attention to them. Caspar found it amusing that the falcons thought they could outsmart their brave dog.

Fritz, the boar-hound, was initially unfazed by the two falcons attacking him, responding with occasional growls. But as the birds got closer, his irritation grew. Their wings nearly struck his eyes, making him lose his cool. The falcons, one attacking from the front and the other from behind, forced Fritz to defend himself in both directions. Annoyed, he snapped at the birds but was clawed on the rear by one. This was the last straw for Fritz. He leaped to catch the falcon but missed as it flew away.

During the evening, the group worked on making paper inside a hut using torches made of cheel-pine for light. They shredded the daphne bark and boiled it with wood-ash in a pot. However, lacking a pot, they used the hot spring near the hut. To overcome the moving water issue, they placed the bark and ashes in a yak-skin, creating a bundle, and submerged it in the spring. After boiling, the bark was dried on a rock. Meanwhile, Caspar made a wooden mallet, and Ossaroo crafted a sieve from bamboo under Karl's guidance. Once the bark was dried, it was pounded into pulp with the mallet and then stirred in lake water to remove impurities. Karl then skillfully made paper by spreading the pulp on a sieve, draining it, and letting it dry to become paper.|"1. What did the group use as torches for light while making paper?

After boiling, the bark was dried on a rock. Meanwhile, Caspar made a wooden mallet, and Ossaroo crafted a sieve from bamboo under Karl's guidance. Once the bark was dried, it was pounded into pulp with the mallet and then stirred in lake water to remove impurities. Karl then skillfully made paper by spreading the pulp on a sieve, draining it, and letting it dry to become paper.|"4. How did Ossaroo contribute to the paper-making process?
A) Boiling the bark

The group worked diligently to craft a large kite from paper made out of boiled bark. The process took several days as each sheet needed to dry before the next one could be made. Karl and Caspar assembled the kite's frame while Ossaroo focused on creating the tail. The rope for flying the kite required meticulous twisting and testing for strength. The kite's framework was constructed from split bamboo, known for its strength and lightness. Glue made from the root of an arum was used to attach the paper. When the wind was right, they launched the kite from a cliff, hoping it would catch on the snow-covered slopes above. With a strong breeze, the kite soared high before descending towards the mountain, disappearing from view as it fell.|"Question 1:

Ossaroo, being the most skilled in handling ropes, took charge of attaching steps to the cord. His companions, Karl and Caspar, could only watch and offer encouragement. Ossaroo used a ladder to climb the first 30 feet of the cliff without the steps. However, only the first ladder could be used. Balancing on the sticks, Ossaroo expertly placed them along the rope. He climbed up and down, using his prehensile toes to grip the thin support. After a break, he climbed back up with more sticks. The day passed with breaks for meals, and Karl collected food while Ossaroo continued his work. As darkness fell, they returned to the hut. Fritz, the dog, showed admiration for Ossaroo's bravery. Despite the wind causing him to swing precariously, Ossaroo worked diligently, unfazed by the danger. Karl and Caspar worried, but Ossaroo persisted with pride and skill.|"1.

Ossaroo was attempting a perilous climb up the cliff using a rope and kite. As he ascended, a sudden danger unfolded - the kite became loose, dragging him down the cliff face. The spectators feared for his safety as he rapidly descended, hoping the resistance would slow his fall. Miraculously, Ossaroo's weight balanced the kite's pull, preventing a disastrous crash. The kite, now uncontrolled, swooped towards him like a bird of prey. Ossaroo narrowly dodged the kite's final descent, avoiding a serious injury. Despite the mishap, the group remained hopeful, attributing the incident to the wind. They decided to wait for better conditions to retry flying the kite. In the meantime, they focused on gathering provisions and preparing for their eventual escape from the valley.|"1. What was Ossaroo attempting to do on the cliff?

The botanist was certain that a birch tree would be the perfect material for their kite, better than daphne paper. However, he doubted they would find one in the valley due to the warm climate. Karl, trying to stay positive, suggested they continue searching. After three days of exploring, they found neither the birch nor the daphne trees needed for the kite. Karl had considered making a balloon instead, but dismissed the idea due to lack of suitable materials. However, after the failed kite experiment, the idea of a balloon resurfaced. They discussed the possibility of making a balloon strong enough to carry weight, like a small animal. Although paper balloons were not an option, they pondered other materials that could work.|"1.

Caspar and Karl were contemplating the idea of creating a balloon to lift them out of their current situation. Caspar, the philosopher, explained that making a balloon was akin to crafting a soap bubble. By filling an airtight bag with heated air, it would become a balloon. The challenge lay in determining how much weight the balloon could carry, considering the materials available. Karl, feeling a bit underestimated by his brother's explanation, questioned the need for a constant fire burning in the balloon, which would typically require a fire-basket. Caspar clarified that for a short ascent, a single filling of hot air would suffice, eliminating the need for a suspended grate. The brothers pondered the practicality of constructing a balloon with the resources at hand, exploring the scientific principles behind hot air balloons.|"1.

To build a balloon, the brothers decided to use eel skins. Caspar suggested boiling the skins to make them lighter. Karl, skeptical at first, tested the idea by boiling one skin and scraping it. The dried skin was indeed lighter. They calculated that they would need around 452 square feet of eel skins to cover a 12-foot diameter balloon. Since each eel skin could yield about a square foot, they estimated needing around 500 skins. Ossaroo was tasked with catching more eels to reach this number. Meanwhile, he spun fine and strong thread for sewing the skins together. The brothers worked diligently to prepare the materials for their balloon-making endeavor.|"1.

"In the valley, Karl and Ossaroo discovered a variety of edible plants in the lake. They found the _Trapa bicornis_, also known as _Singara_, a horned water-nut, and the _Nelumbium speciosum_, a splendid water-lily with pink and white flowers. Karl shared how in Cashmeer, people used the water-lily's seeds and stalks as food. The boys learned that birds walked on the water near the lilies, standing on one leg, which Karl suspected was due to the lily leaves providing a firm footing. The _Nelumbium speciosum_ was identified as the Pythagorean bean and possibly the ancient ""lotus,"" known for its refreshing and strengthening properties. The plant's roots were stored for winter, and in China, it was served to British ambassadors as a delicacy."|"1. What did Karl and Ossaroo discover in the lake?

Ossaroo's prediction came true almost immediately. The two birds landed by the lake, merely twenty paces away from where three waders were busy among lily leaves. Instead of searching for food or heading to the water, the birds rested in an unusual pose. They tucked their long necks between their shoulders, leaving only their heads and beaks visible. Simultaneously, they drew up one leg, concealing it under their feathers. This synchronized behavior hinted at a spiritual connection between them. The observers found it comical, but Ossaroo, accustomed to such sights, remained unperturbed. The group decided to capture the storks after returning their bean-sacks to the hut. Ossaroo believed they could easily approach the tame birds, but lacked the necessary tools. Despite unclear motives for capturing them, the idea of companionship seemed appealing, especially to Ossaroo, facing a solitary life in the mountain valley.|"1.
