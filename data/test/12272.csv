The old chroniclers' accounts are doubted for another reason. The Boriqueños proposed an alliance with their enemies, the Caribs, against a common foe, despite the Caribs not suffering as much as the Boriqueños. This suggests a level of foresight and diplomacy that seems unlikely for both groups. It is more plausible that some fleeing Indians from nearby islands joined the Boriqueños after learning of their plans. Ponce de León sent men to scout the Caribs, leading to a battle where the Spaniards emerged victorious. The Boriqueños, under Ponce's leadership, then faced a large Indian force, eventually defeating them after a strategic stand-off. The death of the Carib leader, Guaybána, marked the turning point, leading to the eventual subjugation of the Boriquén people. The initial estimates of 600,000 indigenous people on the island are now considered exaggerated by modern historians.|"1. Why are the old chroniclers' accounts doubted in the text?

Mr. Brau argues for reducing the estimated population of the island to about 16,000. However, this estimation is flawed because the knowledge of only a part of the island was available. Ponce's conquest was limited to certain areas, and it is likely that there were other regions with local leaders who did not take part in the conflicts. Brau's reasons for the reduction are valid: the island's small size would struggle to sustain a larger population, historical battles involved fewer warriors than expected, and only 5,500 natives were recorded after organized resistance. The mistreatment of natives led to rebellion and forced labor. The distribution of the indigenous people among various individuals and institutions further depleted their numbers. This historical pattern of exploitation and mistreatment led to a significant decline in the native population over time.|"1. Why does Mr. Brau argue for reducing the estimated population of the island to about 16,000?

Mr. Brau argues for reducing the estimated population of the island to about 16,000. However, this estimation is flawed because the knowledge of only a part of the island was available. Ponce's conquest was limited to certain areas, and it is likely that there were other regions with local leaders who did not take part in the conflicts. Brau's reasons for the reduction are valid: the island's small size would struggle to sustain a larger population, historical battles involved fewer warriors than expected, and only 5,500 natives were recorded after organized resistance. The mistreatment of natives led to rebellion and forced labor. The distribution of the indigenous people among various individuals and institutions further depleted their numbers. This historical pattern of exploitation and mistreatment led to a significant decline in the native population over time.|"4. What impact did historical battles have on the estimated population of the island?

The king's favorites in the city aimed to enrich themselves by obtaining grants of Indians and sending their stewards to oversee them.

The attacks by Caribs from nearby islands made the colony's survival even more uncertain. Whenever a new settlement was established, they would swoop down, killing Spaniards, destroying plantations, and abducting locals. In 1520, news of Cortez's exploits in Mexico reached San Juan, inspiring the old adventurer Ponce to action. Despite facing fierce resistance and losing men in encounters with natives, Ponce's attempts to settle Florida failed. The emperor granted his son the title of Adelantado of Florida and Bemini after Ponce's death. Unconquered Indians in other parts of the island remained free, with some fleeing to neighboring islands. Retaliatory attacks on Spanish settlements were common, prompting punitive expeditions that only temporarily subdued the unrest. The Carib invasions were driven by a thirst for revenge and a desire to reclaim their homeland from the Spaniards.|"1. What prompted Ponce to take action in 1520?

During the colonization period, the indigenous people of Puerto Rico, known as the Boriquén Indians, faced harsh treatment and exploitation by the Spanish settlers. Despite attempts to liberate them, the Indians were still treated as slaves as late as 1550. Governor Vallejo reported irregularities in their treatment, with many being sold in secret. By 1582, only a few remained due to diseases, mistreatment, and escape to other islands. The extinction of the natives led to the abandonment of gold mining and cultivation of crops like ginger and cotton. Hurricanes and Carib attacks further devastated the island, leading many to flee to seek fortunes in Peru. The Governor imposed strict measures to prevent mass emigration, fearing the complete depopulation of the island. The riches of Peru enticed many settlers to leave, causing concern for the island's defense against foreign invaders.|"1.

By 1582, only a few remained due to diseases, mistreatment, and escape to other islands. The extinction of the natives led to the abandonment of gold mining and cultivation of crops like ginger and cotton. Hurricanes and Carib attacks further devastated the island, leading many to flee to seek fortunes in Peru. The Governor imposed strict measures to prevent mass emigration, fearing the complete depopulation of the island.

His Excellency Alexander O'Reilly, who arrived in the Antilles on a mission from Charles IV, described the living conditions of the people in Puerto Rico in 1765. He noted that there were only two schools on the entire island, and few outside the capital knew how to read.

Gambling has been a prominent vice among the common people, encouraged by authorities who believed it kept them distracted from politics.

Mr. Francisco del Valle Atilés, a respected writer from Puerto Rico, has provided a detailed account of the lives of the rural people. He classifies them into three groups: those near large sugar and coffee plantations working as laborers, small landowners tending their own plots, and wealthier landowners living away from towns. The typical jíbaro is slender, slow, taciturn, and often appears sickly due to poor diet and living conditions. They mainly eat rice, plantains, and beans, leading to a lack of energy and a reliance on tobacco and rum. Despite facing diseases like paludal fever, they show remarkable endurance when motivated. The jíbaro's illiteracy and simple lifestyle are changing with education and improved living standards, offering hope for a brighter future.|"1.

During the initial period of conquest and colonization, no Spanish women came to this or any other conquered territory. Soldiers, sailors, monks, and explorers did not bring families. As a result, alongside the natives and pure Spaniards, a new population of mixed-race individuals emerged. The offspring of these diverse unions did not inherit the best qualities of their ancestors but often displayed moral decline. The mixing of races led to the creation of groups like mestizos, Eurasians, and mulattoes, where negative traits tended to dominate. Over generations, a fusion of races occurred, resulting in a population with varying skin tones and characteristics. The influence of Spanish, Indian, and African roots is still evident in the people of Puerto Rico today.|"1.

All statements concerning the exact number of the original inhabitants of this island are largely based on guesswork. When Columbus arrived, he only visited one port and did not interact with the locals. Ponce and his crew only conquered a portion of the island, with no time or interest in studying the population. They focused on counting prisoners rather than the actual population. The estimates made by Abbad, O'Reilly, and others were mere conjecture due to the lack of accurate data. The fate of the indigenous population and their intermarriage with conquerors remains uncertain. Despite efforts to explain the decline of the aboriginal population, there is still much doubt and obscurity. Population numbers recorded by Spanish authorities were likely underreported due to various factors. The island's population growth was mainly attributed to agricultural activities, health benefits, frugal habits, climate, and increased peace and prosperity. The population census conducted in 1860 showed a steady increase in inhabitants over the years, indicating progress and development on the island.|"1.

The Caribs' invasions, hurricanes in 1530 and 1537, emigration, internal conflicts, and heavy taxes hindered Puerto Rico's early sugar industry. Initially promising, the industry struggled due to royal taxes on sugar. Bishop Bastidas protested this tax in 1544, urging its suspension to aid mill construction. His plea led to the construction of water and horse-powered sugar mills. Despite such efforts, oppressive laws stifled agricultural growth. By 1644, only ginger, hides, and sugar were major exports. Tobacco and cacao cultivation faced challenges, with tobacco laws so strict that selling to foreigners was punishable by death. The cultivation of cacao struggled due to hurricanes, while coffee, coconut palms, and plantains were introduced later. Agriculture statistics in 1776 showed animal husbandry thriving, though the farming methods were criticized for being rudimentary.|"1. What hindered Puerto Rico's early sugar industry?

The islanders' preference for cultivating low-lying lands due to laziness rather than lack of resources leads to soil depletion, prompting them to move to mountainous areas. Despite ample knowledge, tools, and government support, they shun agriculture, viewing manual labor as degrading. Instead, they focus on low-labor crops like cane, coffee, rice, and tobacco, with sugar cane being a potential main crop. The island's vast agricultural wealth includes various crops, livestock, and produce, valued at millions. The island's prosperity peaked from 1865 to 1872, but a decline ensued due to falling sugar prices, restrictions, and lack of market demand. This led to a state of ruin, with abandoned estates and reduced sugar production, causing widespread economic distress and despair among landowners.|"1.

In 1813, Puerto Rico faced dire circumstances due to the oppressive practices of the government. Despite pleas from various sectors, little action was taken to alleviate the situation. The Minister of Ultramar in Madrid acknowledged the severity of the issues, but change was slow to come. A writer cautiously hinted at the need for reduced taxes, government spending cuts, and the elimination of monopolies. The island's financial woes were exacerbated by widespread smuggling and corruption in revenue collection. However, in 1813, Alexander Ramirez was appointed to bring about much-needed reforms. He overhauled the administration, improved accounting practices, and encouraged commerce. Under his leadership, Puerto Rico's revenues increased significantly, demonstrating the positive impact of his reforms. Ramirez's success led to his transfer to Cuba, but subsequent administrators in Puerto Rico failed to maintain his progress, leading to a resurgence of financial mismanagement and decline.|"1.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Puerto Rico faced financial challenges due to its reliance on external funds. The island's people neglected their own resources, leading to extreme poverty when these external funds ceased. The introduction of paper money and emergency currency worsened the situation, causing a 400% depreciation. To combat this, officials introduced uncoined silver pieces to replace the paper money, but this led to speculation and economic instability. By 1857, Puerto Rico finally adopted Spanish national coinage. Despite financial distress, improvements in administrative systems and foreign commerce helped the island's economy. The financial history of Puerto Rico saw fluctuations in revenues, with occasional surpluses misused for external ventures. Various decrees and ordinances aimed to stabilize the economy, with reforms in financial administration and tax collection.|"1.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Puerto Rico faced financial challenges due to its reliance on external funds. The island's people neglected their own resources, leading to extreme poverty when these external funds ceased. The introduction of paper money and emergency currency worsened the situation, causing a 400% depreciation. To combat this, officials introduced uncoined silver pieces to replace the paper money, but this led to speculation and economic instability. By 1857, Puerto Rico finally adopted Spanish national coinage. Despite financial distress, improvements in administrative systems and foreign commerce helped the island's economy. The financial history of Puerto Rico saw fluctuations in revenues, with occasional surpluses misused for external ventures. Various decrees and ordinances aimed to stabilize the economy, with reforms in financial administration and tax collection.|"4.

During the 1800s, Puerto Rico faced economic challenges due to high export duties that harmed agriculture. The Official Chamber of Commerce struggled to reform tariffs and exchange Mexican coins for Peninsular money. The lack of interest from commercial houses and Spain worsened the situation. Education also suffered, with few schools and limited subjects taught. Only ecclesiastical institutions provided Latin and philosophy education. Not until the 1820s did intellectual life improve, with efforts to establish primary schools and promote literacy. However, political changes brought setbacks, plunging the island back into intellectual darkness. Clergy-led education dominated for two decades until Bishop Pedro Gutierrez de Cos founded the Conciliar Seminary in 1831. Despite challenges, efforts by individuals like Rufo Fernandez to offer free lectures on physics and chemistry showed a glimmer of progress in education.|"1.

In the past, efforts were made to enhance education in Puerto Rico. Fray Angel, the rector of the seminary, proposed adding physics and chemistry courses to the curriculum. However, this idea was rejected by ecclesiastical authorities who believed that such scientific studies were unnecessary for students focusing on ecclesiastical sciences. Despite this setback, the Economic Society of Friends of the Country, established in 1813, played a crucial role in advancing education on the island. This society aimed to promote moral and material progress by establishing schools and offering classes in various subjects. Over time, more schools were opened, but illiteracy remained a significant issue among the population. The lack of access to books and educational materials, coupled with restrictions on learning, contributed to widespread ignorance.|"1.

The idea of public libraries in Puerto Rico did not emerge until the mid-19th century, unlike other colonies that had already embraced intellectual progress after gaining independence. Early collegiate libraries in the capital date back to the 16th century, with the Dominican friars and Bishop Don Bernardo de Valbuena establishing significant collections. Unfortunately, these libraries were destroyed during the siege of San Juan in 1625. Subsequent efforts by Bishop Pedro Gutierres de Cos and the Royal Academy of Belles-Lettres aimed to promote education through libraries, but disagreements led to closures and transfers of collections. Thanks to Governor Charles H. Allen and Commissioner Martin G. Brumbaugh, the first American free library was established, followed by public libraries like the one founded by Don Ramon Santaella in 1880. Today, Puerto Rico boasts several libraries, including the Puerto Rican Atheneum Library, the Casino Español library, and the Provincial Institute of Secondary Education's pedagogical collection.|"1.

In Catholic countries, there are two main types of clergy: the regular clergy, which includes monastic orders, and the secular clergy, which is not bound by monastic rules. The regular clergy, such as the Dominicans and Franciscans, operate under the authority of their superiors, while the secular clergy work under bishops. When the Pope learned of the discovery of the new world by Columbus, he granted the monks the right to administer parishes and collect tithes, a privilege previously held only by the secular clergy. This led to competition between the Dominicans and Franciscans, especially in Puerto Rico, where the Dominicans gained more influence. Over time, the clergy faced challenges, including demands for tithes and disputes over wealth. Eventually, in 1757, the privilege of collecting tithes was revoked, and in 1835, the government expropriated the property of the regular clergy. Despite promises of compensation, the clergy never received full payment, and the orders eventually disappeared from the island.|"1.

In the early 16th century, Spanish settlers established the settlement of Loiza along the river, but it met a tragic fate due to Indian attacks. The cacique Cacimár was killed by Sancho Arángo, leading to a vengeful attack by Yaureibó, resulting in the destruction of the settlement. Among the casualties were Pedro Mexia and his Indian companion Louisa. The settlers engaged in gold prospecting, with Indians doing the labor. The mountains of Puerto Rico were rich in gold, but proper exploration was hindered by Indian uprisings and lack of interest from the governors. The first samples of gold were found in rivers like Manatuabón and Cóa. The gold mining efforts in the early years yielded substantial revenues for the Spanish crown. Governor Bravo de Rivero attempted to establish the settlement of Fajardo on the east coast, but progress was slow due to illicit trade activities and lack of industry among the inhabitants.|"1.

In 1515, a new discovery of gold-rich earth was reported to the king by Sancho Velasquez, the treasurer. He described how gold deposits were found in rivers and streams near San German. The settlers there were able to extract significant amounts of gold, with the king's share amounting to thousands of pesos. The yearly gold output fluctuated but remained steady for several years until the placers started to deplete. Some new gold deposits were found, but the scarcity of gold became a growing concern. Besides the rivers mentioned, many others in the Luquillo mountains were also believed to contain gold. Silver was also discovered in some lead ore veins, but the lack of expertise in smelting hindered further extraction. The reports highlighted the challenges faced by the workers and the diminishing gold resources on the island.|"1. What did Sancho Velasquez report to the king in 1515?

The memoirs and documents of Juan Bautista Muñoz detail the value in gold pesos of bullion and pearls sent to Spain from the island of San Juan de Puerto Rico between 1509 and 1536. The total produce remitted to Spain over these years is recorded as follows: In 1509, 8,975 gold pesos; in 1510, 2,645 gold pesos; in 1511, 10,000 gold pesos; in 1512, 3,043 gold pesos; in 1513, 27,291 gold pesos; and so on until 1536. The total output for this period was 1,389,705 gold pesos, equivalent to $4,169,115 in Spanish coin today. The region's tropical latitudes are known for the birth of hurricanes. These storms, like the great hurricane of 1780, have wreaked havoc on the West Indies, causing immense destruction to life and property, with entire towns and fleets lost to their fury. The aboriginal inhabitants had ways to predict these catastrophic events, including changes in the atmosphere, the behavior of animals, and other natural signs.|"1.

In 1818 and 1814, two hurricanes struck on July 23rd, affecting Yauco and San German severely. The Dario Económico of August 11, 1814, detailed the aftermath. On July 26, 1825, Hurricane Santa Ana ravaged Patillas, Maunabó, Yabucóa, and other towns, causing significant damage and casualties. The San Felipe hurricane of August 23, 1871, had no specific details available. In 1899, Hurricane San Ciriaco caused immense devastation, with excessive rainfall leading to floods and over 2,500 drowning deaths.

The widely accepted theory initially suggested that two distinct races inhabited the West Indian Archipelago at the time of its discovery. The larger Antilles and the smaller islands to the north were believed to be home to the Guaycures, a group allegedly driven from Florida by the Seminoles. The Guaycures were described as peaceful, hospitable, and fond of dancing and singing, making them vulnerable to Spanish conquest. Another race was said to have originated from the south, descending from the Orinoco and spreading to the lesser Antilles. Evidence supporting the south-continental origin of the Caribs includes Venezuelan hieroglyphics and the work of Mr. Aristides Rojas. The Caribs were known for their ferocity and influence over a vast territory. Various theories exist about the Caribs' origin, with some suggesting a connection to the Guaraní family.

"The belief that the Caribs were cannibals is based solely on the accounts of Columbus' companions during his second voyage. When they landed in Guadeloupe, they discovered human bones and skulls in abandoned huts. No concrete evidence of cannibalism was ever found beyond this initial discovery. The Spaniards' imaginations ran wild upon seeing what they believed to be remains of devoured individuals. However, this belief was likely fueled by the era's widespread gullibility. Even Columbus himself, in a letter to Santangel, expressed disbelief in encountering any ""human monsters"" on the islands. Father Bartolomé de las Casas and other reputable sources contradicted the notion of Carib cannibalism, suggesting it was a misconception. Humboldt and Sir Robert Schomburgh also dismissed the idea, describing the Caribs as a peaceful and organized society with no evidence of such practices. Their culture involved unique customs, such as using different languages based on gender and a belief in two spirits. The Caribs were skilled in crafting tools, canoes, and pottery, and their language had Italian-like sounds."|"1.

Father Rochefort, a Jesuit, mentions that the Caribs have changed from their virtuous ancestors due to the negative influence of Europeans. The Europeans mistreated the Caribs, broke promises, plundered villages, and committed immoral acts, leading the Caribs to adopt vices like lying and betrayal. Father Dutertre notes that before European contact, the Caribs were content, healthy, and honest. They had no theft in their society. The French missionaries' attempts to convert them failed due to the negative impressions left by the Europeans' cruel actions. The Caribs defended their homes fiercely and preferred suicide over slavery. By the late 18th century, the few remaining Caribs on St. Vincent, known as black Caribs, were absorbed by French colonists. The author's visit to the region revealed the ruins of Jesuit-Guarani missions, destroyed by the Brazilians. The history of Puerto Rico has been studied by native writers, providing valuable insights into the island's past.|"1.
