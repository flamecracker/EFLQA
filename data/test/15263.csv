I met Peter and Levin by the riverbank, two miles from the plantation. I didn't mention being from Philadelphia or talk about certain subjects. I will need to be cautious when I reach a free State in March with my crew. I must be wise and careful. I feel like I'm being watched, so I can't keep this letter. I might write again from Cincinnati. Florence is where I departed, and it's the head of navigation. I found the place as Peter described, except for the river's distance. South Florence has white families, warehouses, but no school. McKiernon is with me, waiting for a steamboat to New Orleans. My plan is to go to Canada via the Wabash, opposite Detroit. There are different routes, and I chose this one due to risks on the Ohio River. I will travel by skiff, a safer option. When I reach the Wabash, I will follow a specific path to Canada. David Stormon will assist us on our journey. Expenses are estimated at forty dollars, and I may need additional funds for protection.

"Dear Sir,

I must express that raising the amount you ask for the family is beyond our means. Peter has authorized me to offer twenty-five hundred, but gathering such a sum from the public is challenging. In the North, requests for aid are frequent, and many are fatigued by these appeals. While some of us own property, it is not substantial enough to bear this burden. Mother has a small farm in New Jersey, sustaining her in old age. My brothers have modest holdings, supporting their young families. I work as a clerk, but my salary limits my contribution. We lack wealth but have friends. I appeal to your humanity. Could you reduce the price or release them without charge? Your decision holds their happiness. Please consider our situation.

"Dear Mr. William Still,

I hope this letter finds you well. I received your letters and papers with gratitude. The words written to slaveholders are powerful, coming from someone who has suffered under slavery. I felt compelled to share them to raise awareness and speak out against oppression.

Times are dull here, but we are all well. I deeply regret the recent excitement surrounding the issue of slavery. Please keep me updated on any developments. Your kindness is greatly appreciated, and I hope to reciprocate it someday.

The impending judgments foreseen in the ""Warning"" have come to pass, and slavery has been abolished. Despite his hardships, the old blind father of Jackson, Isaac, and Edmondson still lives to witness this freedom.

In the face of desperation, brave slaves like Robert Brown, also known as Thomas Jones, sought new ways to escape. Robert's daring escape from Martinsburg, Va., in 1856, where he swam the Potomac River on horseback on a cold Christmas night, stands as a testament to the relentless pursuit of freedom. Robert's courage and sacrifice for liberty are truly remarkable.

Yours sincerely,

I sent some of her belongings to Boston a few days ago. If I had known their significance in court, I could have provided witnesses who would confirm that she intended to be free before leaving Washington. It was clear that she planned to use her freedom if Wheeler made her free by taking her to a free state. The attempt to forward the goods failed on Sunday, but it will be tried again soon. I feel angry at the man, but Judge Kane and Douglas are helping our cause. I wish there was a way to help in extreme cases where the owners can't afford to advance all the freight. I want to caution you that I would never assist in helping servants escape. The words in brackets have no meaning for you, they are only to mislead others. The matter of moving the goods to Philadelphia was discussed with two professors who were willing to help. The hope of freedom kept the young slave girl going during the long wait. Mr. Bigelow was faithful despite facing challenges. There were concerns about the safety of colored citizens in the city, and I urge you to act quickly to avoid any conflict or suspicion.|"1.

My dear friend, I am delighted to inform you that my wife and children have safely arrived in this city. Unfortunately, my wife faced some misfortune as she lost $35, which included money for the children. She had to travel to Niagara Falls and telegraphed me to come after her.

I am deeply saddened by this news. I have not heard from my uncle in a while, so any updates would be appreciated. Also, inquire about Mr. Anderson's whereabouts. Hezekiah, driven by a desire for freedom, decided to escape slavery. Despite saving nearly enough to buy his freedom, he was betrayed. He fled from a trader in Petersburg, Virginia, and sought refuge in Richmond. Despite facing challenges, Hezekiah remained determined to escape. His courage never wavered, even as he faced obstacles. His resilience and bravery are truly inspiring.

Sincerely,

In 1853, a passenger arrived in Philadelphia from Norfolk, Virginia. This man, named Archer, had been under the control of Dr. George Wilson for four years before deciding to escape. Archer felt mistreated by the doctor, who allowed him to hire his time for $120 a year but did not reduce the amount when he was sick. This unfair treatment led Archer to seek freedom. He was a man of mixed race, a dark mulatto, and at the age of thirty-one, he made the brave decision to escape slavery. With the help of the Vigilance Committee, Archer found his way to Boston and became a citizen there. Another man, Samuel, also fled from Virginia in 1853 due to similar mistreatment. He realized the value of money as a means to freedom and saved every dollar until he could escape. Samuel, along with two others, sought refuge in New Jersey but soon faced the threat of capture by slave-hunters.

A man or woman fleeing for freedom, carrying belongings or holding a child, was always a remarkable sight that should be remembered. The descriptions provided by slave owners often showed great artistic skill and detailed knowledge of their enslaved individuals. These descriptions were so vivid that the Committee preferred using them rather than creating new ones. While some ads were open to criticism, they served their practical purpose well. For instance, one ad described Isaac as very light-skinned with no noticeable marks, which was a common tactic for slaves seeking escape. The owners, like Mr. Dade and Mr. Owings, showed generosity in their rewards, reflecting a sense of southern chivalry. The fugitives, such as Sam and Isaac, displayed courage and determination to reach Philadelphia and eventually Canada for freedom. Their stories, shared by the Committee, shed light on the harsh realities of slavery and the resilience of those seeking liberation.|"1. What was one purpose of the vivid descriptions provided by slave owners?
A) To create new identities for the enslaved individuals

C) To aid in the search for escaped individuals
D) To hide the physical appearance of the enslaved individuals
E) To discourage others from seeking freedom"|C) To aid in the search for escaped individuals|Yes

The descriptions provided by slave owners often showed great artistic skill and detailed knowledge of their enslaved individuals. These descriptions were so vivid that the Committee preferred using them rather than creating new ones. While some ads were open to criticism, they served their practical purpose well. For instance, one ad described Isaac as very light-skinned with no noticeable marks, which was a common tactic for slaves seeking escape. The owners, like Mr. Dade and Mr. Owings, showed generosity in their rewards, reflecting a sense of southern chivalry. The fugitives, such as Sam and Isaac, displayed courage and determination to reach Philadelphia and eventually Canada for freedom. Their stories, shared by the Committee, shed light on the harsh realities of slavery and the resilience of those seeking liberation.|"4.

"The trial of Sam Green, a free black man, for possessing materials that could incite discontent among people of color, took place recently. Evidence revealed that Green's son in Canada received aid from him, leading to suspicions of aiding runaway slaves. Search of Green's house uncovered incriminating items like ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" and a map of Canada. Despite strong evidence, the court found the law inapplicable and declared Green not guilty.

Concerns arose about his loitering and potential capture. Some distrusted him, labeling him as an impostor and a braggart claiming to be a dentist for ten years. Samuel, well-dressed and articulate, mentioned traveling to the Anti-slavery office. Eventually, Samuel and his group reached Philadelphia, where they were warmly received.

"To Mr. Still, Dear Sir,

I am writing on behalf of a young man named James Morris, who passed through your care in July of 1856. His wife, Lucy Morris, and their child, Lot Morris, are in danger of being sold in Virginia. James is eager for them to escape, and he has saved forty dollars to help bring them to Toronto, Canada West. Please direct any correspondence to Mrs. Ringgold in Toronto, as I will be out of town.

It is unknown if James was successful in reuniting with his family. Many fugitives in Canada, mostly single young men, found Irish partners and married. There are likely white women in Canada today who married fugitive husbands of slave women.

Perry Shephard, Isaac Reed, George Sperryman, Valentine Spires, Daniel Green, James Johnson, Henry Cooper, William Israel Smith, and Anna Dorsey are among those who sought freedom from various locations, enduring hardships for the hope of liberty.

Thank you for your attention,

Perry Shephard and Isaac Reed fled the Eastern Shore of Maryland, leaving behind loved ones. George Sperryman escaped oppression in Richmond, Virginia, while Valentine Spires sought freedom from Dunwoody near Petersburg. Daniel Green fled from Warrington near Leesburg due to threats of being sold."|"1. What is the main purpose of the letter written by Perry Shephard?

Judge Kane's meticulously crafted charge led the Grand Jury to indict forty Christiana offenders for treason, including James Jackson, a Quaker and abolitionist.

Despite opposition, acts of kindness were shown to the prisoners, such as a Thanksgiving dinner organized by Thomas L. Kane. The pro-slavery party protested the gesture, but it resonated as a symbol of support for freedom. Jackson's trial was a pivotal moment, with abolitionists and pro-slavery advocates clashing over the Fugitive Slave Law. The abolitionists, led by prominent lawyers, stood for freedom and justice, while the pro-slavery side relied on legal maneuvers and public sentiment.|"1.

Due to his mistreatment by his Christian master and mistress, Bill lost faith in the Protestant religion, believing it to be a sham. He mentioned the lack of proper seating for African Americans in church, which led him to abandon the Protestant faith.

Pascal's previous master, who was also his father, intended to set him free but tragically died before doing so. Pascal was eventually sold to Bannon and Brady, where he faced harsh treatment. Eventually, Pascal found freedom by escaping to Canada. This story was shared by Thomas Garrett in a letter to William Still, informing him of the arrival of three men, one of whom was nearly naked and infested with lice after spending eighteen months in the swamps of Carolina. Garrett arranged for their transport to Philadelphia.|"6. How did Pascal find freedom?

Respected Friend William Still, I write to inform you that Harriet Tubman is back in our area. She arrived last evening from a merciful trip, bringing two men to New Castle.

"Dear friend,

I hope this letter finds you and your family in good health and happiness. I recently arrived in Boston, where I met Mr. Garrison and his wife, who were very kind. I have been staying with Mrs. Hilliard since my arrival. Although I have not yet been to Canada as planned, I did see the letter you wrote to them. I experienced some headaches on the journey but have been feeling better since. Please remind Julia Kelly that I accidentally took one of her pocket handkerchiefs, which I will keep as a memento. I must end this letter now as I have no more to say. Yours faithfully.

In 1856, a message alerted the Secretary that a schooner carrying fifteen Underground Railroad passengers would arrive near League Island. Carriages were arranged to receive them late at night. The passengers, filled with joy, were helped off the schooner. Despite encountering dangers on the voyage, including evading the police, they were safely taken to the station. The captain's ingenious plan for the Underground Railroad operation proved successful, ensuring the passengers' safety."|"1. What did the author experience on the journey to Boston?

Cross-examined.--I haven't seen her since 1826 until I saw her in the court. I recognized her immediately without anyone pointing her out, and she recognized me too.

DEAR FRIEND: I urge you not to think I have forgotten you in Philadelphia due to my delay in writing. I have neglected correspondence with many friends lately.

Although isolated, we both strive for the same cause, even from a distance. Are we not united in spirit? Miss Watkins continues to advocate for the voiceless.

Dear friends, we have a heartfelt inquiry for you. Can we, in England, gather £50 or £60 for a year of schooling for two special girls, Elizabeth Rawlings and J.G. Fee's daughter? Elizabeth deserves it for her boldness, and the other as a tribute to her father. Imagine if these girls could become teachers in England, maintaining schools of high standards in their homeland. We've shared this with a few friends and already sent £8 to Mr. Fee for Elizabeth. Next, we have Cornelia Williams, Henry H. Garnet's niece, who was freed from slavery with help from friends. She's doing well in school in Nantucket. Frederick Douglass, a dear friend, had to return to the U.S. due to personal reasons but remains committed to the abolition cause. He trusts in God's plan and continues to fight for freedom.|"1. What is the purpose of gathering £50 or £60 in England?

"A man recently arrived in town from Charleston, where he escaped hidden among cotton bales to Greenock. He now works in a saw-yard, earning fair wages, but his heart aches for his wife and children still enslaved.

Our friends entrusted my husband and me with their money for the fugitives, allowing us to use it as we see fit.

"Lucretia Mott mentioned to my sister that the trunk had very little clothing, mostly old items. I believe she meant there was nothing significant inside.

"Dear friend,

Enclosed is a contribution of five dollars for the fugitives, a small amount to share among many, but better than nothing. It is a wish that the wealthy would remember them instead of spending excessively on themselves. Even those who are not rich could give from their abundance if they had a willing heart. It is disheartening that there is not enough sympathy for these destitute individuals. As it is said, ""Inasmuch as ye have not done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have not done it unto me.""

Thank you for your letter dated 17th, which I received last night. Amy Reckless visited me yesterday, asking to delay sending for a day or two as she hopes to gather more funds and clothing. President Hamlin's kindness towards the contrabands is appreciated. Their situation is deplorable, especially with the approaching cold weather. I have read the President's emancipation proclamation with gratitude, but upon reflection, I have concerns about the three-month delay before it takes effect. It worries me to think of the potential harm that may come to these individuals during that time.

I am enclosing seventeen dollars from various contributors, including Amy Reckless and others. Amy is also collecting clothing for the cause. I will ensure it is sent as soon as possible. Your efforts to aid the poor sufferers are commendable, and I eagerly await your insights on the matter.

Warm regards."|"1. What is the main purpose of the enclosed contribution of five dollars?

It is true, I have always lived by a simple rule. I never bothered to count the lashes slaves received or travel to the South to study slavery. I just asked myself: Would I want to be a slave? No. Did God make me to be one? No. If I'm not meant to be a slave, then no one is. My family wasn't made for the auction block either. That's why I've always been against slavery.

"In 1831, I started the ""_Liberator_"" in Boston, with little fame, no support, and no funds. Yet, the impact was immense, causing an uproar in the South. Despite the nation siding with slavery, the truth prevailed. Georgia even offered $5,000 for my capture. Reflecting on missed opportunities during General Sherman's march, I realized the reward would be worthless in Confederate currency. Southern slavery has crumbled.

The young man bravely spoke out against the injustice at the auction, warning bidders not to buy him. His brother also stood up against the sale. Both brothers managed to escape and hide in the city.

I was not worried about Molly's safety near where she was caught, thinking her master wouldn't search there. Molly stayed with us a month, but decided to head further North after seeing many fugitives. I contacted Thomas Garrett to find her a good home, which he did.

She left him and later reached Canada. One morning in December 1845, a wagon arrived at my house with fugitive slaves, led by Samuel D. Burris.

Despite facing various forms of opposition from different segments of society - the indifference of the wealthy, the prejudice of some, the disdain of the educated, the reluctance of business or religious leaders fearing disruption - he persistently challenged the prevalent wrongs. Whether on holidays, workdays, or Sundays; at home or outside; in social settings, streets, offices; in his teaching and in the Church - he confronted the apathy and scorn like a refreshing west wind cleansing a city plagued by decay. His influence spread far and wide, sowing seeds of truth indiscriminately. His mission was to awaken his peers to the moral decay caused by complacency, even if they turned against him.
