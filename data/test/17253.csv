The attack on Tripoli by sea did not go as planned due to the poor quality of the shells used. Captain Bainbridge, who was a prisoner in the city, observed that out of forty-eight shells fired on one day, only one exploded. Investigation revealed that some fuses had been tampered with, possibly by French agents. The Tripolitans were known for their fierce hand-to-hand combat skills but learned to fear the Americans' tactics. To create panic, a plan was devised to use the _Intrepid_ as a bomb ketch. Loaded with gunpowder and shells, it was to explode in the harbor. Master-Commandant Richard Somers led the mission, with Midshipman Henry Wadsworth and others. The night of September 4 was chosen for the operation, and each sailor prepared for the perilous task.|"1. Why did the attack on Tripoli by sea not go as planned?

From then on, the _Essex_ had so many captures that telling all of them would be boring. The fastest ships seized were repaired and added to the American fleet under Captain Porter's command.

During a fierce battle, two Americans were killed and seven wounded, while the enemy suffered thirty-four killed and eighty-six wounded, including their leader.

In 1819, Oliver Hazard Perry, known for his heroism at Lake Erie, was tasked by the Government to end the piracy troubles. It was a challenging mission because Perry had to stop the pirates without upsetting the countries involved, as we aimed to keep friendly relations. The pirates disguised their acts, sometimes pretending to be authorized privateers. Perry, with his quick decisions, courage, and discretion, led three powerful ships to the mouth of the Orinoco in July 1815. His journal describes the extreme discomforts they faced - intense heat, relentless insects, and unbearable thirst. Despite the challenges, Perry sailed up the Orinoco, but sadly, he succumbed to yellow fever and passed away. His legacy was honored with a grand burial and a monument in Rhode Island. Subsequent efforts by other naval leaders like Captain James Biddle and Captain David Porter continued to combat piracy in the West Indies, showing bravery and dedication in the face of danger.|"1.

When American property was stolen and taken to Foxardo, Lieutenant Platt sought help but was met with disrespect and accusations of being a pirate. Captain Porter, upon learning of this, took action. He entered the harbor, demanded an explanation, and when faced with hostility, he spiked shore batteries to protect his crew. Despite his brave actions, he was unjustly suspended from service. However, he later served in the Mexican navy and was appointed consul general at Algiers by President Andrew Jackson. Captain Warrington continued Porter's legacy by suppressing piracy in the West Indies, ensuring peace in the region. In the Mediterranean, Lieutenant Goldsborough and Lieutenant Carr also fought against piracy, earning recognition for their efforts."|"3. Why was Captain Porter unjustly suspended from service?
A) For being a pirate
B) For failing to protect American property
C) For spiking shore batteries
D) For seeking help from Lieutenant Platt

By taking immediate and courageous action, the American navy earned respect worldwide, even from barbarous peoples. A notable event in history illustrates this. In February 1831, the _Friendship_, a trading ship from Salem, Massachusetts, was loading pepper near Qualla Battoo, a small Malay town on Sumatra's northwestern coast. Captain Endicott and his crew were vigilant due to the Malays' reputation. While onshore supervising the pepper trade, Captain Endicott noticed a suspicious boat maneuver. The boat, initially thought to aid in navigating the surf, instead brought armed warriors to the ship. Deceptive tactics allowed the warriors to board and overpower the crew. Alerted by two crew members, Captain Endicott swiftly rescued the remaining sailors with the help of a friendly tribesman, thwarting the attackers and saving his crew from further harm.|"1.

As the ships journeyed southward, the risk from ice and icebergs grew. The _Peacock_ and _Flying Fish_ set sail from Orange Harbor alongside the _Porpoise_ and _Sea Gull_. A fierce storm separated them, with the _Peacock_ battling icebergs, its ropes and deck coated with ice. The _Flying Fish_ ventured to 70 degrees south but faced the threat of being trapped by ice and low provisions, forcing a retreat north. While the _Flying Fish_ returned to Orange Harbor in April, the _Peacock_ headed to Valparaiso, meeting the _Relief_. The squadron then crossed the Pacific to Sydney. Lieutenant Wilkes planned another Antarctic voyage, but the _Flying Fish_ had to return due to damage. Amid perilous icy encounters, one ship narrowly escaped being crushed by falling ice. The expedition faced harsh cold, with snow cutting like bird shot. After further exploration and conflicts with natives, peace was eventually secured.|"1.

During the mid-1800s, an American naval squadron embarked on a journey of exploration, visiting the Hawaiian Islands and the coast of Oregon. Unfortunately, one of their ships, the _Peacock_, met with disaster at the Columbia River's mouth. After navigating around the Cape of Good Hope, the expedition returned to New York in 1842, covering over 30,000 miles in nearly four years. The onset of the Civil War marked a pivotal moment for the U.S. Navy, which faced challenges due to lack of preparedness. Despite initial setbacks, the navy rapidly expanded its forces, enlisting volunteer officers and sailors to bolster its ranks. Notable figures like John Lorimer Worden emerged during this tumultuous period, showcasing bravery and resourcefulness in executing critical missions behind enemy lines.|"1.

Lieutenant Worden was a prisoner until November 13th, when he was exchanged due to failing health. He was sent North where he slowly regained strength. In March 1862, he played a significant role in a famous naval battle. The Union forces at the Norfolk Navy Yard couldn't prevent its capture by the Confederates, who set fire to valuable ships, including the Merrimac. The Confederates raised the Merrimac, armored it with iron, and renamed it the Virginia. News of the ironclad reached Washington, prompting the construction of a smaller ironclad by Captain Ericsson. The Merrimac, armed with ten guns, faced Union vessels in Hampton Roads. It defeated the Cumberland and Congress, causing alarm in the North and rejoicing in the South. The Merrimac's power was a game-changer in naval warfare.|"1. What significant role did Lieutenant Worden play in March 1862?

During a historic naval battle, the _Monitor_, a small but nimble ironclad ship, faced off against the formidable _Merrimac_. The _Monitor_ carried two powerful 11-inch Dahlgren guns and was crewed by 16 officers and 42 men, including Lieutenant Worden and Lieutenant Green.

During the war with Mexico, Lieutenant Boggs was given a task aboard the steamer _Princeton_ to bombard the Castle of St. Juan de Ulloa and Tampico. Unfortunately, the brig _Truxton_ got stuck on the bar of Tuspan River and had to be surrendered to the Mexicans. The _Princeton_ was ordered to destroy it. Lieutenant Boggs led a boat close to the wreck, but they were caught in a sudden tropical storm. Unable to reach the wreck or return to the _Princeton_, they drifted towards the shore where Mexican soldiers were waiting with a cannon. Lieutenant Boggs cleverly used a torn white shirt as a flag of truce, preventing an attack. He explained their mission to the Mexican officer, who then hosted them until the storm passed. After the storm, the _Truxton_ was destroyed, and Lieutenant Boggs returned to his ship.

A peculiar event is described by his biographer. He accompanied the group that aimed to take Tampico, but the city surrendered without a struggle upon seeing the boats approaching. He stayed for several weeks before returning to the fleet at Vera Cruz. During his absence, Captain Semmes, who later led the _Alabama_, occupied Winslow's room until other arrangements were made.
