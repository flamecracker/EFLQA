"A strange and fascinating scene unfolded before Von Bloom and Hendrik. The sky was darkened not only by a swarm of insects but also by a variety of birds. Among them were the large African vultures like the brown ""oricou"" and the yellow ""chasse fiente."" The air was filled with the majestic ""lamvanger"" and the fierce ""Caffre eagle."" Hawks, kites, crows, and ravens were also present, along with the peculiar ""bateleur."" However, the most abundant were the tiny ""springhaan-vogel,"" speckled birds resembling swallows. These ""locust-vultures"" fed exclusively on the insects, following them wherever they went. The horizon was covered with the blackened bodies of the locusts as far as the eye could see. As night approached, the birds scattered, and the earth fell silent. The cattle, unfazed by the insects, were devouring them eagerly. Von Bloom and Hendrik were amazed to witness this peculiar sight."|"1. What was the main reason for the darkened sky in the scene described in the passage?

The group had a tough time driving off the insects, but the sound of a lion and Swartboy's whip helped. They were cautious due to the abundance of snakes. The field-cornet was anxious as the wind could bring locusts to ravage his crops. The night was tense, fearing for the cattle too. Von Bloom checked the wind, but it stayed the same. The moonlight revealed the vast swarm of locusts. Amidst the chaos, the lion's roar, jackals, and hyenas could be heard. Swartboy shared his knowledge about locusts, explaining their origins and habits.

Hans explained that fires are lit to prevent wingless locusts, known as _voetgangers_ (foot-goers), from swarming. These locusts are actually larvae before developing wings. They crawl and leap like grasshoppers, migrating in a straight line, overcoming obstacles like streams and walls. When faced with broad rivers, many are swept away, while smaller groups are deterred by fires. However, when large numbers advance, even fires can't halt them. The flying locusts are more wind-guided, often ending up in the sea. In Africa, farmers fear locust invasions as they devastate crops, likening it to a calamity. Truey asked if these were the locusts John the Baptist ate in the desert, as mentioned in the Bible.|"1. What is the purpose of lighting fires according to Hans in the text?

Hans modestly explained to his father that while the locusts mentioned in Scripture were not exactly the same as those in South Africa, they were similar in habits. Some believe the locusts were actually beans from the locust-tree, not insects. However, Hans firmly believed that Saint John ate the insect locusts, not the fruit. He pointed out that locusts and wild honey were often eaten together by desert tribes, as mentioned in Scripture. Hans, well-versed in locust literature, praised the Bible's account of these insects. He fetched the family Bible, a cherished book among Dutch colonists, and read a passage from the prophet Joel about a devastating locust invasion. Swartboy added that in South Africa, locusts are a vital food source for various animals, birds, and even the mighty elephant.|"1. What did Hans believe Saint John ate according to the passage?

The Bushmen and other native tribes in Africa have a unique way of preparing locusts for consumption. Swartboy spent the evening cooking the locusts he had collected. He first steamed them with a small amount of water for two hours, then dried them and removed the legs and wings by shaking them in a pan. After a winnowing process, the locusts were ready to eat with just a little salt to enhance the flavor. Some children even enjoyed them, finding them similar to shrimps. For many tribes, the arrival of locusts is a cause for celebration. They collect them in sacks and store them in their villages like grain. The night passed with discussions about locusts until it was time for bed.

As Swartboy and Hendrik rounded up the twelve yoke-oxen for the wagon, the field-cornet, with the help of Hans, Totty, Truey, and little Jan, loaded up the furniture and tools. It was a quick job since the kraal possessions were few and soon stored on or around the spacious vehicle. The direction they chose was crucial.

North was the Kalahari desert, a barren choice. Von Bloom considered the west. Forty miles away was a spring with good pasture he knew of, a better location for cattle.

"Sometimes the boys were asked to assist Swartboy with the leading oxen when they misbehaved. Hans or Hendrik would quickly ride up, correct the oxen's direction, and use the ""jamboks"" to discipline them.

"When everything was prepared, Swartboy once again climbed onto the front of the wagon, gathered the reins, cracked his whip, and the team started moving. The heavy wagon, loaded with supplies, glided off smoothly, much to everyone's joy. Von Bloom, Hendrik, and Hans cheered as it passed by, while they herded the milch-cow, sheep, and goats behind. Little Jan and Truey remained in the wagon while the rest walked alongside to lighten the load on the horses.

The lion's behavior when faced with the horsemen passing by the kraal was a strategic move to avoid confrontation, showcasing the lion's reasoning abilities akin to a human's. Contrary to common misconceptions, lions do not always exhibit cowardice but rather assess situations based on various factors like age, hunger, and the type of hunters in the area. Just like dogs vary in character, lions too display differences in courage and ferocity influenced by external factors. The lion's behavior towards hunters is shaped by experience, much like how alligators in different regions have adapted to human presence. Lions in Cape districts, for instance, may exhibit varying levels of bravery based on their encounters with hunters. The color of a lion's mane, like black or yellow, is often mistakenly linked to their courage, highlighting the importance of understanding individual differences within species.|"1.

Around midday, thoughts of dinner crossed my mind after a satisfying breakfast. Reluctant to hunt another sheep, I left Jan and Truey by the wagon and Totty in charge of the flock. With my gun in hand, I set off on foot to seek game, spotting springboks in the distance. The plain was a spectacle of graceful gazelles in motion, leaping and browsing. As they drew nearer, I observed their elegant forms, cinnamon backs, and lyre-shaped horns. Taking aim, I fired, causing the doe to fall. Surprisingly, the others remained unfazed, continuing their peaceful grazing. It dawned on me that this was a migration, a `trek-boken,' explaining their unusual behavior. Surrounded by the herd, I found myself in a peculiar yet unthreatening situation, unable to move faster than the advancing animals.|"1. What did the speaker do after having breakfast?

As I moved closer to the group of animals, trying to push through them, they jumped and leaped over each other, hindering my progress. Despite my attempts to clear a path with my gun, they were too slow. Just as I was about to break through, I noticed a large open space ahead. As I approached, I found the animals even more tightly packed. Suddenly, I saw a yellow lion in the center, causing the disruption in the herd. Feeling scared and unsure, I debated whether to shoot the lion but decided against it to avoid a dangerous situation. The lion then turned away, allowing me a chance to escape as it pounced on an antelope. Thankfully, the lion was preoccupied with its prey, giving me the opportunity to retreat safely.|"1.

In the African wilderness, Von Bloom faced a challenging situation. His flock of sheep and goats had vanished, leaving only the cows and horses with no grass to feed on. Tracking the springboks, who had mixed with his animals, seemed futile. Swartboy confirmed the difficulty of finding them amidst the vast herds. The horses were hungry, surviving on meager mimosa leaves. Despite the desolate landscape, Hans managed to secure two springboks for a meal, providing much-needed sustenance. As the weary travelers rested and refreshed near a spring, they observed vultures circling a distant yellow mass—the lion they had hunted. The carnivores wasted no time devouring the lion, revealing the harsh reality of nature's hierarchy. Von Bloom, accompanied by Swartboy, set out early on horseback, leaving the family behind to await their return, hoping to find a solution to their predicament.|"1.

They rode westward, guided by the springboks' direction from the north. Von Bloom spotted cliffs to the north, a sign of potential water nearby. Riding closer, he saw a beautiful landscape with grassy plains, mimosa copses, and towering trees. The area contrasted with the nearby barren desert of Kalihari.

"The field-cornet decided to let his horse graze for an hour before heading back to the wagon. He admired the giant ""nwana"" tree with its wide canopy and large fruits.

Bright scarlet geraniums, starlike sweet-scented jessamines, and the gorgeous belladonna lily with large rose-colored and white blossoms delighted her. Bushes and trees adorned with gaudy and sweet-smelling flowers filled the air with their pleasant perfume.

"The cow produced abundant milk on the lush pasture. The milk was so delicious that everyone received a generous portion. Elephants are well-known creatures, but there are two distinct types: the African and Asiatic elephants. The African elephants have huge ears that meet above their shoulders and hang below their breast, while the Indian elephants have smaller ears. The tusks of the African elephants are much larger, sometimes weighing close to two hundred pounds, compared to the Indian elephants whose tusks rarely reach one hundred pounds. The African elephants also have tusks in females, unlike the Indian elephants where females either have no tusks or very small ones. There are other differences between the two, including the number of toes and the shape of their front. Additionally, there are variations within the Asiatic elephants, with two main castes known as ""coomareah"" and ""merghee."" The coomareah is compact and strong, while the merghee is taller with longer legs. White elephants, which are albino, are highly valued in some Asian countries.

"The African elephant, like its Indian relative, can be tamed and trained for various tasks. Historically, Carthaginian armies used African elephants in warfare. These majestic creatures once roamed freely from Abyssinia to Senegal and even as far south as the Cape of Good Hope. However, due to ivory hunters armed with long guns, their habitat has shrunk. Some believed Abyssinian elephants were Indian elephants, but this misconception has been corrected. There are likely different variations of African elephants across the continent, with larger ones found in tropical regions. Hunters fear a tuskless and aggressive type known as ""koes-cops."" While elephant meat is edible since they are herbivores, it may not be as tasty as other meats due to their diet.

"The African elephant, like its Indian relative, can be tamed and trained for various tasks. Historically, Carthaginian armies used African elephants in warfare. These majestic creatures once roamed freely from Abyssinia to Senegal and even as far south as the Cape of Good Hope. However, due to ivory hunters armed with long guns, their habitat has shrunk. Some believed Abyssinian elephants were Indian elephants, but this misconception has been corrected. There are likely different variations of African elephants across the continent, with larger ones found in tropical regions. Hunters fear a tuskless and aggressive type known as ""koes-cops.""

After extracting the ivory and storing it safely, Von Bloom and Swartboy began the serious task of butchering the elephant. Von Bloom and Swartboy were the main butchers, while Hans and Hendrik assisted. They focused on the upper half of the carcass as it was sufficient for their needs. They removed the thick outer coat and several layers of tough skin. The skin was discarded as they had enough water vessels. They then peeled off the pure flesh, separated it from the ribs, and removed the ribs to access the valuable fat around the intestines. Swartboy climbed into the carcass to remove the intestines. The feet were separated, and the meat was cut into strips for preservation. Swartboy had a secret method to preserve the feet, involving digging a hole and placing the feet inside before covering it with earth.|"1.

Swartboy cleaned the elephant's feet, and Von Bloom put the remaining horses out of their misery. The cow was the only livestock left and was cared for diligently. She provided precious milk for their diet. Each day she was taken to graze and locked in a thorn kraal at night. The kraal was well-protected, even lions would hesitate to enter.|"1.

"On that day, another lovely pet joined the group, a tiny fawn, as beautiful as the springbok but even smaller. It was an ""ourebi"" fawn, a delicate antelope from the plains and bushes of Southern Africa. Hendrik, their friend, not only brought this pet but also treated them to a delicious venison dinner that day, which they all enjoyed more than elephant meat.

"Many naturalists believe that the hyena found in South Africa, known as the ""straand-wolf,"" is a different species from the common hyena. Another type, the ""brown hyena,"" resides in the Great Desert, distinct in appearance but similar in behavior.

In a remote area with sparse trees, Von Bloom pondered building a house in a giant nwana tree for safety from man-eaters. Remembering that some natives live in trees for protection, he considered the idea. With platforms on branches and ladders for access, they could sleep securely and leave the children while hunting. The concept seemed ideal, but the challenge was obtaining planks for the platform. Near the thorny jungle, suitable timber was scarce. Von Bloom's solution relied on creating a stable platform in the tree, using the leaves as a roof.

But hold on! There was no need to dismantle it - not a single nail needed to be removed. The exquisite wagon was designed to be disassembled and reassembled at will. The field-cornet, thrilled with this ingenious plan, shared it with the others. Everyone agreed it was perfect, so they wasted no time and got to work. First, they had to build a thirty-foot ladder, which took some time, but they managed to construct a sturdy one. Von Bloom climbed up and chose the perfect spot for the platform. The wagon was swiftly taken apart, and the bottom was hoisted up first. It was a challenge, but they managed to set it in place. Branches were pruned to make room for the tent, which was then lifted and mounted. By nightfall, their aerial abode was ready for occupancy. The next day, they extended the platform to the tree trunk using long poles and willow rods. They topped it with a layer of clay for a fire pit. Swartboy built platforms for himself and Totty with roofs for shelter.

Von Bloom was uncertain if his plan was doable, but he had no choice. He needed a way to make a living and was determined to try. He believed in his calculations and had hope for success. Eager to start, he set out early with Hendrik and Swartboy, leaving Hans at the camp to watch over the children. They followed a stream towards the woods where they thought elephants might be found. The landscape changed from bushes to open plains and then to the wild karoo. They noticed the stream widening but with less water. After a mile, the water stopped flowing, and they only found stagnant pools. They saw small game but refrained from shooting to avoid scaring off potential elephants. The main goal was to find tusks, with fresh meat being a secondary priority. Swartboy used his bow silently, ready to shoot if needed.|"1.

As they ventured into open clearings, they stumbled upon a vast anthill situated in the center of one of the open spaces. The elephant had recently passed by the anthill, pausing there for a moment. Von Bloom was surprised to discover that elephants sometimes lie down to rest, contrary to the belief that they sleep standing up. Swartboy, however, explained that elephants often lie down, especially in areas where they are not frequently hunted. This behavior indicated to Swartboy that the elephants in the vicinity had not felt threatened, making them easier targets for hunting. In regions where elephants are frequently pursued, they quickly flee upon hearing gunshots, making it challenging for hunters to track them. The group observed signs that the elephant had indeed rested there, leaving imprints in the mud and turf. Swartboy shared interesting insights about elephants, like their preference for leaning against objects when lying down to prevent rolling over, and their tendency to nap beside trees during the hot daytime hours.|"1.

The elephant, frightened like the hunters, rampaged through the jungle, destroying trees in its path. It ran for miles, leaving the hunters behind. The group wanted to pursue but realized it was futile without horses or dogs. Von Bloom regretted losing his horses as elephants easily outrun hunters on foot. Upon returning to camp, they sensed something amiss. Totty, Truey, and Jan seemed troubled. Hans had left to follow strange, pony-like animals to the vley hours ago. The children, anxious, hadn't heard any shots. The animals were peculiar, with yellow-brown fur, manes, and horns. Jan thought they resembled ponies, while Truey likened them to lions. The creatures pranced and had split hooves, manes, and tails like ponies, yet resembled bulls too.|"1. What did the elephant do when it was frightened by the hunters?

Jan accurately described the distinct features of the wildebeest or gnoo, a remarkable ruminant animal. The tuft over the muzzle, long hair between the fore-legs, downward-curving horns, thick neck, horse-shaped body, whitish tail, and flowing mane are all typical of the gnoo. These creatures bear a striking resemblance to lions, especially the old bulls. Jan's keen observations noted their red fiery eyes, fierce look, buffalo-like heads and horns, stag-like limbs, and pony-like appearance. The males are larger and browner than the females, with calves being lighter in color. Wildebeests roam the South African karoos in large herds, emitting a moaning sound that gave rise to their name. They are typically harmless but turn dangerous when wounded, with old bulls becoming aggressive. These animals display capricious antics, running swiftly and circling around hunters with lowered heads, kicking up dust, and bellowing like lions. There are three distinct species of gnoos in Africa, each unique in appearance and behavior, with the wildebeest being the most common.|"1.

Hans and Swartboy knew the value of the aard-vark they had caught. The creature was rare and a delicacy, making it a prized find. The aard-vark, difficult to capture, was a nocturnal animal with sharp senses of smell and hearing. Its long ears helped it detect even the slightest sounds. This creature was not the only ant-eater in South Africa; there was also the pangolin, covered in scales and with a long tongue to catch ants. The pangolin resembled a lizard and had similar habits to the aard-vark. The group had a simple dinner of roasted bustard, satisfying their hunger. Hans shared a tale of missing a chance to hunt wildebeests due to an oversight in loading his gun. Despite the excitement, he managed to load it in time to take a shot at the herd.|"1.

I hurriedly followed the herd, trying to stay hidden. Surprisingly, the wildebeests were not afraid of me. The old bulls even danced nearby, allowing me to get close.

The lengthy explanation finally came to light. It wasn't the wiping of sweat that angered the wildebeest; it was the sight of the scarlet handkerchief being shaken out.

The spoor led them through thick jungle, where only elephants, rhinoceroses, or men with axes could pass. They discovered a family of elephants had passed through recently, led by the old bull who cleared the way with his trunk and tusks. The trail eventually led to open ground where the elephants scattered, making it challenging to track them.|"3.

While searching for something in the sparse and scraggly bush, Swartboy suddenly dashed off to the side, urging Von Bloom and Hendrik to follow. They thought he had spotted an elephant and readied their guns, eager and anxious. Peering down, they noticed the ground beside a tree was trampled, as if animals had been tethered there, wearing the turf into dust. The bark of the tree was smooth on one side, showing signs of being used as a scratching post by cattle. They realized it was an elephant's sleeping tree. With haste, they gathered the necessary tools - an axe, a strong rawhide rope, and knives - to prepare for the elephant's return. Swartboy directed the operation, instructing them to cut and shape three sturdy stakes to secure the tree. Despite the urgency, Swartboy skillfully dug deep, narrow holes for the stakes without the need for a spade, ensuring a secure setup for the impending encounter.|"1.

The hunters realized that stalking elephants on foot was challenging. Horses would have been a better option to catch the elephants. Von Bloom worried about the lack of success and the impact it would have on his children's future in the wilderness without proper education or society. Sitting on a platform in a tree, he pondered the difficulties ahead.|"1. What did the hunters do after cutting out the tusks from the elephant?

Wild-asses are large animals resembling small horses, marching in a line like a caravan with about fifty individuals. They have a steady pace, unlike the erratic movements of gnoos. These animals have stripes on their cheeks, neck, and shoulders, similar to a zebra but less distinct. They share characteristics with horses, asses, gnoos, and zebras, but are distinct as quaggas. The Equidae family includes horses and asses, with key differences in manes, tails, and callosities. Asses have short manes and tails with long hairs only at the tip. There are various species of wild-asses in Africa, such as the onagra and dziggetai. The zebra family includes the true zebra, Burchell's zebra, Congo dauw, quagga, and white zebra, all marked with transversal bands. The true zebra is white with black stripes, while dauws have less defined stripes and different coloring. The habitat of these species varies across Africa.|"1.

The ""white zebra"" has only been seen by one traveler, Le Vaillant, leading to doubts about its existence as a distinct species. Each species herds with different animals - the quagga with the gnoo, the dauw with the brindled gnoo, and the ostrich with both. The mountain zebra is shy, the dauw is untameable, and the quagga is timid and docile, easily trained. The field-cornet, Von Bloom, suddenly becomes interested in capturing and training a troop of quaggas for hunting elephants, realizing their potential for use. He, along with Hans, Hendrik, and Swartboy, plan to capture the quaggas for this purpose."|"5. What is Von Bloom's sudden interest in capturing and training a troop of quaggas for?
A) Farming

"The hunters faced a dilemma on how to capture the quaggas returning to the vley to drink. Hendrik suggested ""creasing,"" a method of shooting the upper neck to immobilize the quagga without killing it. However, Hans found this method cruel and suggested using snares instead. But Hendrik argued that snaring might only catch one quagga and scare off the rest. The field-cornet noticed that the quaggas always entered the water at one point and left at another. This observation led to a new plan: setting a trap on the trail where the quaggas exited the water. By galloping the quaggas into the trap at that moment, they could capture the whole herd at once. This strategy seemed promising and offered a more efficient way to capture the quaggas without causing harm."|"1. What was Hendrik's suggestion to capture the quaggas?

During the planning of their capture, the herd of quaggas remained visible on the open plain, frolicking. Although tempted, Hendrik refrained from showcasing his marksmanship skills on them to avoid deterring them from returning to the vley. The hunters observed the quaggas from the safety of the branches of a tree, hidden from view. The quaggas remained oblivious to their presence. As one quagga neared a bush, a striped hyena suddenly emerged and fled in fear. Surprisingly, the quagga pursued and swiftly subdued the hyena, demonstrating their animosity towards each other. The quagga's victory over the hyena showcased their protective nature, often used by farmers to guard their cattle. Von Bloom, observing the quaggas, proposed a plan that required immediate action to ensure its success before the quaggas returned. The group had the necessary tools and worked efficiently to dig a pit and cover their tracks before the quaggas' arrival.|"1.

The hunters had outlined a pit and began digging with spades and shovels. The ground was loose, making the work easier. The field-cornet, Hendrik, and Swartboy dug, while Hans, Totty, Truey, and little Jan helped by carrying baskets of dirt. After a day's work, they stopped to rest and planned to finish the pit the next day. At dawn, they resumed digging until the pit was deep enough. They covered the pit with poles, bushes, rushes, and grass to camouflage it. The hunters hoped to trap quaggas by driving them into the pit. Each hunter predicted how many they would catch, aiming for at least four. They set up an ambush around the lake, waiting for the quaggas to approach. The hunters planned to scare the quaggas into the pit by creating a panic.|"1. What were the hunters digging in the passage?

The entire plan was well designed and executed successfully. The herd was seen moving across the plain, just like in previous instances. Von Bloom alerted the three hidden individuals to their approach by softly repeating the words. The leader, upon climbing the bank and noticing fresh grass and rushes on the path, hesitated momentarily but was startled by the loud gunshot, followed by echoes from other guns and Swartboy's loud shout from another direction. A glance backward revealed the quaggas were nearly surrounded by unfamiliar foes. With no other option, the herd rushed up the bank, heading towards the pit. Chaos ensued as the quaggas struggled to avoid falling into the pit, with some leaping high in the air and others running back into the lake. Ultimately, most of the herd made their way back through the gorge they had come from, disappearing from sight within minutes. In less than two weeks, four of the quaggas were trained to be ridden and obedient. Hendrik, a skilled hunter, was exceptional in providing food for the group, often hunting antelopes. Africa is known for its vast variety of antelope species, with over seventy types worldwide, more than fifty of which are found in Africa. Hendrik was particularly skilled in hunting antelopes, ensuring a well-stocked larder for the group.|"1. What did Von Bloom do to alert the hidden individuals to the approaching herd?

The largest antelope, the eland, is a massive animal weighing about one thousand pounds and standing as tall as a large horse. It has straight horns that are two feet long, spiraled with ridges. The eland is not a fast runner and can be easily approached by a mounted hunter. Their eyes are large and gentle, showing no fierceness. Elands are independent of water and prefer desert plains for security, although they can also be found in fertile areas. They are social animals, herding in groups of up to a hundred. The eland's meat is highly prized, compared to tender beef with a gamey flavor. The hunt for elands is not very exciting, as they are not fast runners and are quickly captured for their valuable venison.|"1. What is the main characteristic of elands mentioned in the text?

The largest antelope, the eland, is a massive animal weighing about one thousand pounds and standing as tall as a large horse. It has straight horns that are two feet long, spiraled with ridges. The eland is not a fast runner and can be easily approached by a mounted hunter. Their eyes are large and gentle, showing no fierceness. Elands are independent of water and prefer desert plains for security, although they can also be found in fertile areas. They are social animals, herding in groups of up to a hundred. The eland's meat is highly prized, compared to tender beef with a gamey flavor. The hunt for elands is not very exciting, as they are not fast runners and are quickly captured for their valuable venison.|"5. Why is the hunt for elands not very exciting?

B) They are fast runners
C) They are difficult to approach

Hendrik, a skilled hunter, used strategy to approach the elands without alarming them. He circled around to position himself between the herd and a cliff. Riding his quagga, he bent low to deceive the elands, who watched him with curiosity and some alarm. When Hendrik drove the elands toward the cliff, they changed direction, giving him an advantage. He chased them across the plain, knowing he could drive the tired eland back to camp instead of wasting resources by killing it on the spot. As Hendrik reached the ravine, the eland, startled by approaching quaggas, tried to escape.

Constructing a gun-trap to catch elusive animals can be a clever strategy. In South Africa, Von Bloom set up a trap using three trees in a line. The gun was placed horizontally, with the muzzle aimed at the entrance of a kraal. A string connected to a stick behind the trigger was tied across the entrance, so any movement would pull the trigger. Bait was placed inside to lure animals. That night, a tiger-wolf fell for the trap and was shot dead as it entered the kraal. The bullet pierced its heart, showing the effectiveness of this method. This demonstrates the importance of precision and strategy in hunting.|"1. What was the purpose of setting up the gun-trap in the text passage?

Once the hunters reloaded the gun, they returned to rest. Despite the thought of moving the dead hyena to avoid warning the others, Swartboy knew better. Hyenas see their fallen comrades as prey, not a threat. By morning, another hyena fell into the trap. But a more dangerous visitor lurked - a family of lions. While the camp was safe in the trees from lions, the nightly roars were unsettling. The hunters adapted the trap for lions, using fresh animal bait. The lions fell one by one. With the predators gone, the children could play freely, always cautious of danger. Truey once strayed near the water with her loyal gazelle companion.|"6.

Truey wandered along the shore of the lake with her pet springbok, enjoying the tranquility of the surroundings. As they strolled, they came across a small peninsula covered in green grass and a unique Babylonian willow tree. The tree's branches drooped down, almost touching the water, and on each branch hung odd-shaped objects resembling inverted salad-oil bottles. These objects were actually weaver-bird nests, intricately woven by the skilled birds. Weaver-birds are known for their nest-building abilities, with different species constructing nests of various shapes and using different materials. Some build nests resembling kidney shapes, while others create nests that look like suspended hedgehogs. The social gros-beak even builds a cluster of nests under one roof, forming a republic of nests in one clump atop a tree.|"1.

Slowly moving along a branch, a large serpent caught Truey's attention with its glittering scales. It was spiraling down a willow tree branch, seemingly coming from bird nests.

"The serpent-eater, also known as the ""crane-vulture,"" is a unique bird that primarily feeds on snakes. While it also consumes lizards, tortoises, and locusts, snakes are its preferred prey. Found in Africa, the Gambia, and the Philippines, this bird is solitary and nests in thorny trees. It is an excellent runner and spends more time on foot than flying. Despite being shy and wary, it is easily domesticated and kept by Cape farmers to control snakes and vermin. A tamed serpent-eater once saved Jan and Truey from a deadly snake bite. After being wounded and cared for by hunters, it repaid their kindness by protecting Jan from a cobra. The bird caught the snake by the neck in its beak, rose vertically to drop it, stunning the snake before it could coil around the bird's wings."|"1. What is the preferred prey of the serpent-eater?

Found in Africa, the Gambia, and the Philippines, this bird is solitary and nests in thorny trees. It is an excellent runner and spends more time on foot than flying. Despite being shy and wary, it is easily domesticated and kept by Cape farmers to control snakes and vermin. A tamed serpent-eater once saved Jan and Truey from a deadly snake bite. After being wounded and cared for by hunters, it repaid their kindness by protecting Jan from a cobra. The bird caught the snake by the neck in its beak, rose vertically to drop it, stunning the snake before it could coil around the bird's wings."|"2. Where is the serpent-eater primarily found?

The field-cornet dedicated much time to tending the maize field, watering the plants and creating small mounds around them for protection and nourishment. The result was impressive; the cornstalks grew to a height of twelve feet with ears nearly a foot long. The anticipated harvest would provide maize-bread, hominy, and other dishes for feasts. Totty, observing from a platform in the nwana-tree, noticed a peculiar sight. A group of over two hundred baboons, resembling large dogs with greenish-brown fur and black faces, were approaching from the cliffs. Baboons, known for their uncouth appearance and habits, are native to Africa. These creatures possess strength and cunning, capable of outsmarting other animals and even humans for food.

After taming the quaggas, hunting became more successful for the group. They were able to collect pairs of tusks every week, creating a small pyramid of ivory near their camp. While the quaggas helped them catch elephants, sometimes they lost their prey. Introducing dogs to the hunt changed the game. The dogs couldn't harm the elephants but could track and bark, distracting the elephants and giving hunters a chance to shoot safely.

This was indeed the case as the dog managed to steer the antelope off its course, prompting the pack to adjust their direction diagonally, attempting to intercept the game. By doing so, they avoided the detour taken by the antelope and their companion. The hartebeest altered its path, with one hound leading the pack once more.
