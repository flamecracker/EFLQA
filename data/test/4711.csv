After enduring three days of rain, the sun finally came out, lifting everyone's spirits. Tom and Ned began preparing the balloon, closely watched by the Mexicans. Tom had a unique gas-making method that allowed for a smaller balloon size. Once the balloon was ready, Tom, Ned, and Mr. Damon took a test flight, astonishing the Mexicans with their airship. They then spent busy days stocking supplies for their journey to find the ruined temple. Tom paid off Delazes and his group, instructing them to wait in camp. With everything set, Tom signaled for everyone to board the balloon, marking the beginning of their adventure.|"4. Why were the Mexicans astonished by Tom, Ned, and Mr. Damon?

In an hour, Tom realized his balloon would no longer be visible to the Mexicans. He then steered west, flying low to use trees as cover while maintaining good speed. Tom and his friends were en route to the city of gold, sailing for three days over vast plains and dense jungles impassable by ox carts. They crossed rivers, halting each night with the airship secured to trees. Tom efficiently managed the lifting gas on board, minimizing wastage during descents. Despite challenges like rain and strong winds, they persevered westward. Meals were prepared in the tiny kitchen, and they scanned below for a plain with a ruined temple. After a week of searching, they spotted a vast plateau with a white stone temple ruin at sunset. As they landed near the ancient structure, Tom marveled at its immense size and ancient history, speculating about the lost city of Poltec that once surrounded it.|"1.

Eradicate and his friends were on a mission to find a tunnel entrance inside an old temple. Despite the bats flying out, they were determined to locate it before breakfast. They searched the temple's interior, which was in ruins, with fallen roofs and gaping holes. The temple had two circular buildings, one within the other, with living quarters for priests. Inside, they found a vast room with stone altars and statues, hinting at past worship activities. However, after days of searching the temple's perimeter, they couldn't find the tunnel entrance. It wasn't until they realized it might be inside the temple's central chamber that their search strategy changed. The group decided to explore the inner chamber next, hoping to finally discover the hidden tunnel entrance.|"1. What were Eradicate and his friends searching for inside the old temple?

Tom, Ned, Mr. Damon, and Eradicate ventured into the ruins without breakfast to explore. Navigating the debris to reach the inner chamber was challenging. The sacrificial chamber was solid, but disappointment struck as they found no tunnel. Upon closer inspection, Tom noticed a bundle on the altar. To their surprise, the altar moved, revealing a dark hole with steps leading down. Cautiously peering into the abyss, they hesitated to descend due to safety concerns. The odd man warned of potential dangers and advised waiting for clearer air. Tom suggested returning with electric flash lamps before descending. As they left the temple, the group felt relieved yet alert, wary of encountering others in the desolate ruins.|"1. What did Tom notice on the altar in the sacrificial chamber?

The boys were well-prepared for exploring the dark tunnel with their electric lamps. Tom had a special lamp with tungsten filaments that provided a powerful light, and they had batteries that were designed to last a long time. They made sure the lamps were charged and ready before heading back to the opening to check the air. Tom tested the air by dropping a match down, which burned clearly. As they descended into the unknown darkness, their bright lights illuminated stone walls and steps, creating an eerie atmosphere. Suddenly, they encountered a stream rushing between two stone walls, filling the tunnel with a roaring sound.

They drained the water, revealing a cave with golden streets and statues. Excited by the wealth, they decided to take some gold, statues, and move their balloon to the temple for safety.

"While the man of color was away, Tom, Ned, and Mr. Damon returned to the stone gate.
