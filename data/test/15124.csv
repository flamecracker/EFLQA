In ancient times, a tale was told of an abbot from Aberbrothoc who placed a bell on the treacherous Inchcape Rock. This bell, rung by the waves, warned sailors of the hidden danger. However, a mischievous pirate, Ralph the Rover, cut the bell loose. Years later, karma caught up with him as his ship wrecked on the very rock he had sabotaged. Subsequently, in the early 19th century, a storm in 1799 led to the decision to build a lighthouse on the Bell Rock to prevent further tragedies. The lighthouse was a groundbreaking engineering feat, as it was erected on a submerged reef, making it a challenging and daring task.

After some grumbling and sighing, the crew emerged from their sleeping quarters onto the deck of the ship. Each was handed a glass of rum and a biscuit as their morning fuel before they embarked on their tasks. Ruby faced a dilemma; he wanted to bid Minnie farewell before leaving the _Pharos_, but she was still fast asleep. Additionally, he needed to ask his uncle some questions, but the uncle was snoring loudly, disrupting the peace. Despite these obstacles, Ruby decided to let go of his concerns, finished his breakfast, grabbed his tools, and joined the others in the boats. The initial fatigue from waking early faded as the boats set off, and soon a race was proposed. Amidst the excitement, a wave from a port caught Ruby's attention, and he waved back. Laughter erupted as the men mistook the wave for themselves, but they quickly refocused on the race ahead. The boats raced to the rock, where the _Smeaton_ awaited to transport them to Arbroath. Seals once frequented the rock but fled when construction began. Building the lighthouse presented challenges, especially in landing the heavy, fragile stones. Various methods were proposed, but ultimately, the stones were transported in praam boats from Arbroath to the rock, where they were carefully laid to construct the lighthouse.|"1.

A skilled engineer was chosen to construct the Eddystone Lighthouse, a challenging task due to the distance from land and dangerous conditions. Despite facing difficulties, the lighthouse was completed in four years and lit on November 14, 1698. The engineer, Mr. Winstanley, even spent a stormy night in the lighthouse during construction. Unfortunately, in 1703, the lighthouse was destroyed by a severe storm, fulfilling a prophecy. This led to the construction of a new lighthouse in 1706, which stood until 1755. Tragedy struck when a fire broke out in the lantern room, resulting in the loss of the lighthouse. Despite rescue efforts, only the keepers survived, with one going mad and disappearing, while another died from ingesting melted lead during the fire.|"1.

A skilled engineer was chosen to construct the Eddystone Lighthouse, a challenging task due to the distance from land and dangerous conditions. Despite facing difficulties, the lighthouse was completed in four years and lit on November 14, 1698. The engineer, Mr. Winstanley, even spent a stormy night in the lighthouse during construction. Unfortunately, in 1703, the lighthouse was destroyed by a severe storm, fulfilling a prophecy. This led to the construction of a new lighthouse in 1706, which stood until 1755. Tragedy struck when a fire broke out in the lantern room, resulting in the loss of the lighthouse. Despite rescue efforts, only the keepers survived, with one going mad and disappearing, while another died from ingesting melted lead during the fire.|"6. What tragic event occurred in the second Eddystone Lighthouse in 1755?
A) Earthquake
B) Tornado
C) Fire

E) Avalanche"|C) Fire|
The third Eddystone lighthouse, built by Mr. Smeaton in 1756, has stood strong for fifty years. It was lit by twenty-four candles, a marvel of engineering. Bremner and Selkirk discussed the importance of the texts carved on the lighthouse, attributing its success to divine guidance. As a storm raged outside, the men inside felt a strong disinclination to leave. When a heavy sea struck the building, causing it to shake, they inspected for leaks. Ruby, exposed to the violent gale, saw the sea swirling around the beacon. As the tide rose, waves crashed through the floor, drenching them. Tools were swept away, and they worked to secure movable items. Despite the dangers, they managed to save most things before retreating to the kitchen. The men battled the elements, trying to keep the fire burning and the leaks sealed throughout the night.|"1. What was the purpose of the texts carved on the third Eddystone lighthouse?
A) To guide ships safely
B) To honor Mr. Smeaton

It was a dreadful situation indeed. Forsyth faced a perilous moment, suffering from a terrible toothache and dreading the inexperienced hands of Bremner. Despite his fears, Forsyth bravely agreed to the tooth extraction. As Bremner attempted to pull the tooth, Forsyth's yells filled the room, but the wrong tooth was gripped initially. After a second attempt, the correct tooth was seized, leading to more painful yells. The storm outside intensified, with waves crashing against the beacon. Suddenly, a massive rock struck the structure, causing panic among the men. The mortar-gallery collapsed, and a boat hanging nearby was swept away by the sea.

"The night passed with solemn glances and silent reflections of the men, reviewing past days and making resolutions for the future. The lighthouse was built solid from the foundation up, with a spiral staircase leading to the rooms above. The process had key moments, like laying the foundation stone and the tower emerging above water at high tide, symbolizing victory over the sea. The tower and beacon were connected by a rope-bridge called ""Jacob's ladder,"" later replaced by a wooden bridge. Despite the routine work, accidents like a mason losing a finger were rare. The balance crane used for lifting stones was a clever contrivance. Building the lighthouse posed challenges, especially when cranes couldn't reach the top, requiring innovative solutions."|"1.

In these conditions, Mr. Stevenson devised a beam crane fixed at the center of the tower, capable of ascending with the construction. The crane, shaped like a cross, had a movable weight on one arm that could be adjusted along its length. The other arm hoisted the stones. Each stone's weight was determined, and the movable weight was positioned precisely to balance it, eliminating the need for bulky bracing chains to the rock below. Bonnyman was operating the crane when he accidentally injured his finger. He was swiftly taken to Arbroath for treatment. The incident occurred when the Smeaton arrived at the rock with a load of stones. The mate and a crew member were securing the boat when a chain mishap caused a buoy to capsize the boat, tragically resulting in the loss of the young crew member, Scott. His mother, already burdened with her husband's imprisonment, accepted a job for Scott's younger brother to help support the family.

One morning, the workers arrived at the rock at 6:15 a.m. for a special task. Instead of returning to the tender for breakfast, they ate on the beacon and spent the day working. The task involved moving a crane from the eighth to the ninth level, a challenging job that required all their strength. As the crane was quite high at thirty-five feet and unsteady, it was difficult to manage. The workers were assigned their positions on the tower and around the rock. To increase the power of the tackle, a stone block was added to the crane's movable beam. Unfortunately, due to a simple mistake of not securing the tackle properly, the crane with the heavy stone fell and injured one worker, Michael Wishart. Despite the accident, Wishart showed great courage and was taken for medical help. Another worker, Robert Selkirk, took over his duties. Later, a pleasure yacht approached the rock with gentlemen from Leith, unaware of the dangers of landing due to the rough sea. Two rowers attempted to navigate the boat through the waves, risking a dangerous landing on the Bell Rock.|"1. What time did the workers arrive at the rock for the special task?

Ruby carefully planned his swim near the rock, calculating the ideal spot to enter the water. Despite the strong tide, he attempted to reach the eddy but was pushed back by a wave. Struggling against the current, he found himself swept away from the rock. Suddenly, a rush of water propelled him back towards the eddy, where he was violently thrust against the rock. As a massive wave loomed overhead, Ruby clung to seaweed, bracing for impact. The wave crashed, its force mitigated by Cunningham's Ledge. Gasping for air, he swam through the foam to safety at Port Stevenson. Resting on Smith's Ledge, near the towering Bell Rock Lighthouse, Ruby found solace amidst the raging storm. The lightkeepers above were oblivious to his ordeal. Recovering his strength, he made his way to the entrance door, where he encountered the aftermath of the French commander's fall, leaving the crew in disarray. They resorted to seeking help from an English sailor, using gestures and a cocked pistol to convey their urgent need for navigation assistance.|"1.
