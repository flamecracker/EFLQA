One day, I noticed a pair of birds taking strings from a box near my window. Instead of scolding them, I marveled at their craftsmanship as they built a nest with care and precision. The mother bird's dedication to her eggs was heartwarming, showing the true beauty of nature."|"1. What inspired the author while observing the world outside?

Once upon a time, in the countryside where my little sister and I lived, we had a special place called the froggery. It was a hidden, cool pool surrounded by green bushes where frogs lived happily. We watched the polliwogs grow into frogs, nursed injured ones in a hospital corner, and let the tiniest frogs play in the nursery. We had two strong bullfrogs, one we called the ‚ÄúGeneral,‚Äù who jumped over the fences and ran away to find his home in a big pond. Despite losing the General, we enjoyed our time in the froggery, caring for the frogs and learning about their lives.
