The sun still lingered in the sky due to the ship's northern latitude. Amidst the calm twilight, only the faint sounds of the ship and seabirds were heard.

"When Temple, Sorrel, and Grant arrived in Bergen, the time was well past midnight. Despite their hunger and exhaustion, the awe-inspiring scenery had captivated them, causing them to skip supper and resist sleep.

Temple's prior study of the Norse language aided in communication, while Grant struggled and Sorrel relied on a few phrases to get by. Temple even humorously explained the phrase ""ver so goot"" as a jovial expression of goodwill and comfort in Norse culture."|"1.

Their journey that day, like every other day, involved a challenging mix of uphill and downhill terrain. The landscape was so hilly that a leisurely pace was out of the question. They had to descend steep slopes quickly to make up for the time spent climbing up. The thrill of this wild ride excited the travelers, each with a hint of daring in their nature. The Norwegian ponies, small and usually cream-colored, with black or white manes and tails, were sturdy and lively creatures. They seemed to enjoy the fast-paced gallop after each demanding climb. The shooscarle, typically the pony's owner, wore a distinctive red nightcap and simple clothing. Fred led the way, Norman stayed in the middle, and Sam followed behind to ensure they stayed together. As they approached a steep section of the road near a river, Grant attempted to take the reins, but the ponies knew the way well. Fred and Grant navigated the descent and the bridge safely, while Sam, initially dozing off, had a close call near the river's edge before regaining control.|"1.

The shooscarle, typically the pony's owner, wore a distinctive red nightcap and simple clothing. Fred led the way, Norman stayed in the middle, and Sam followed behind to ensure they stayed together. As they approached a steep section of the road near a river, Grant attempted to take the reins, but the ponies knew the way well.

When Sam realized his situation, he opened his eyes and braced for trouble. Not being an experienced driver, he didn't anticipate a large stone on the road. Despite the impending crash, the sturdy little cariole handled it well. After safely crossing a river, they faced a challenging hill. A sudden halt by the leader caused a jam, but they managed to mend the trace easily. The harness was simple, made of reins, a wooden collar, and saddle. Fred's detour led them into a lost state among the hills. They changed horses every ten miles, but confusion set in at a gloomy spot. Surrounded by mountains, the valley had a serene, rosy glow from the mountain-tops. The night was tranquil, with only the soothing sound of distant waterfalls breaking the silence.|"1.

The sun rose, and the birds chirped as they arrived at the next stop. To their surprise, this station was even poorer and more dismal than the previous one. Nestled in a rugged gorge, it seemed more suitable for wolves and bears than humans. Evidence of these wild creatures was apparent as a wolf skin and a bear skull adorned the walls of the first hut they entered. The villagers were impoverished and lacked intelligence. Accustomed to solitude, they were taken aback when asked for food. The travelers had to scavenge for sustenance themselves, finding only barley meat and sour milk. The Norwegians relished this sour milk, a staple made from cows grazing in mountain pastures. The hut was basic, furnished with log beds, stools, and a chest. Despite the humble setting, the travelers were welcomed, with the locals helping prepare a meal of porridge and fresh fish caught by Fred.|"1.

Fred was startled by a loud noise and a massive rock crashing past his door, demolishing a shed and trees in its path. The rock had tumbled from the cliffs above, narrowly missing the hamlet. The valley was littered with fallen rocks, a common occurrence in Norway. The region experiences continuous daylight in summer and darkness in winter. Fred, delayed by calm seas, missed the sun's complete circle in the sky. The perpetual daylight amazed him and his friends. The scene evoked heavenly imagery from the Bible. Countless islands surrounded them, some small as boats, others towering mountains. Sea-birds filled the air with cries and melodies. Judging distances was tricky, as Bob Bowie mistook a large island for a smaller one. The deceptive appearance surprised the voyagers as they sailed through the serene waters.|"1.

Once, while sailing up a fiord, the passengers debated its width. Most believed it to be a mile across, but sailor Bill insisted it was only three-quarters of a mile.

Sam was completely confused by the perpetual daylight in the Arctic. He once went to bed at ten in the morning, mistaking it for night after working on Grant's eagle. Fred teased him about it, joking that maybe Sam needed a lunatic asylum. They were cautious not to fish or shoot on Sundays. The friends rowed to a creek for fishing and hunting. Grant bagged grouse, Fred caught sea-trout and a salmon, while Sam painted. Hans, fascinated by fly-fishing, was amazed by Fred's skills. When Fred hooked a salmon, Hans missed gaffing it the first time but succeeded on the second try. They returned to the schooner with their catch, where Captain McNab and Bob Bowie awaited them with smiles.|"1. What confused Sam in the Arctic?

During their voyage along Norway's rugged coast, Fred and his friends rarely attended church. This didn't mean they weren't Christians; in fact, they aimed to live like Christ. On a calm Sunday, as their yacht sailed at a leisurely pace, they gathered for a service on deck. The crew joined in prayer as the vessel glided under towering cliffs and past rocky islands. Suddenly, as they rounded a promontory, a picturesque bay unfolded before them. With a sandy beach, green mounds, and quaint cottages, it stood out amidst the rugged landscape. A church on the highest mound overlooked the bay where a Norwegian vessel and small boats floated. Despite their limited church visits, Fred and his companions lived out their faith through their actions, finding moments of peace and beauty in nature's grandeur.|"1.

The cape around which the ship had just sailed provided complete protection to the bay, making the water as smooth as glass, reflecting boats, rocks, houses, and even the church. The sound of the church bell, though small, rang sweetly across the sea like a familiar hymn to the voyagers. The scene became more captivating as people gathered for church, arriving in boats from all directions. The men in red caps and women in white kerchiefs added a colorful touch to the otherwise somber attire. The church itself was unique, resembling a cluster of dove-cots with a steeple and weathercock. Inside, the church was plain yet clean, with minimal ornamentation around the altar. Despite some confusion, the visitors observed the Lutheran service respectfully, with Bob unintentionally finding himself seated among women. Embarrassed, he quietly left and was later found enjoying a smoke near the boat.|"1. What did the cape provide to the bay?

Once, the crew left their schooner becalmed near the shore and rowed towards land. Pulling along the shore beneath a towering cliff, they heard voices above. Though bushes obscured their view, the sounds suggested a dispute. Suddenly, a crash and a dark object falling caught their attention. It was a pony and cariole that had tumbled off the cliff into the sea. The splash and foam marked where it vanished beneath the waves, only for the pony to resurface unharmed. On a different day, they encountered a whale while sailing up the Skars Fiord, a startling and impressive sight. The calm waters revealed the whale swimming near the yacht, close enough to see its features clearly. The crew was excited, especially when the whale dived beneath the yacht, reemerging on the other side. Fred even took a shot at the whale, causing it to swim away. Another adventure led them to a remote fiord, where the locals welcomed them warmly.
