"A woodsman often marks his path by chipping trees with an axe, leaving white scars on their trunks. To follow, you look for these marks from tree to tree. If you need to create your own trail, break branches of trees and bushes, bending them to show the direction you're going. Make the signs clear and close together. It's wise to look back often and remember landmarks. To make a permanent trail, blaze trees with a hatchet, with one blaze away from camp and two toward it. Remember, two blazes mean ""camp on this side,"" and one blaze means ""away from camp on this side."" It's crucial to distinguish animal trails from human-made ones. Animals step over or around things, while humans step on them. Following an animal trail can lead to water, a bog, or even the animal's den. Always keep sight of your broken branches to find your way back."|"1. What does a woodsman use to mark his path in the woods?

Learning to identify animal tracks and trees is essential for outdoor enthusiasts. The lynx leaves cat-like tracks without claw marks, while the mink's tracks resemble specific shapes. Rabbits' tracks consist of two large oblongs followed by round marks, indicating the hind feet lead with a unique gait. The direction of travel can be determined by the hind feet tracks. Recognizing the freshness of tracks helps estimate the animal's distance. The balsam-fir tree, similar to Christmas trees, emits a sweet aroma from flat needles with a twist at the base. The spruce tree, with sharp-pointed needles covering all sides, contrasts the balsam-fir. Spruce-gum can be found in the bark's seams and is sought after in early spring. Understanding these tracks and trees enriches outdoor experiences.|"1. What kind of tracks do lynxes leave behind?

An essential part of woodcraft is navigating the wilderness using natural signs and a compass. To start, know the direction of your camp from where you are. Memorize landmarks around camp and note the wind and sun direction. In the morning, face the sun to find east. Pointing both arms out, your right finger is south, left is north, and back is west. Observe landmarks in each direction and the wind's origin. If the wind is west and you walk east, it should hit your back going away and face returning. Always mark your trail and look back at landmarks. Use the map, sun, shadows, wind, compass, and trail markings to stay on course. Check the sun's position for time and use a splinter or knife blade shadow on a surface to find the sun on cloudy days. Watch leaves or paper bits for wind direction and use a wet finger to sense wind changes while walking to avoid getting lost.|"1.

To construct a lean-to shelter, start by placing upright poles at least five feet above the ground. Lay a top pole across them, with five or six slender poles resting against it at regular intervals. These slant outward and backward, creating a slope for sleeping space underneath. Use natural pegs or stumps on the slanting poles to secure cross poles at right angles. Ensure the stumps face up to hold the cross poles in place. Cover the frame with bark and thatch for added protection. Begin thatching from the bottom, overlapping the branches like shingles. Fill in the sides with branches and boughs. For a more permanent camp, build a log lean-to with an open front, slanting roof, and a low back. Add a raised board floor covered with balsam for comfort. Finish the roof with boards or thatched poles overlaid with bark.|"1. What is the purpose of placing upright poles at least five feet above the ground when constructing a lean-to shelter?

When camping in an area without materials for a bough-bed, each girl can bring a bag made of sturdy cloth to be filled with leaves or grass for a comfortable mattress. Ensure the bag is well-filled to avoid it becoming flat and hard when lying on it. For a pillow, make a bag from brown linen and fill it with browse or clean underwear if needed. Side trips for overnight camping can be exciting, but ensure the sleeping spot is clear of twigs and stones for a good night's rest. Rotate watch duties throughout the night to enjoy the sounds of nature and keep the camp safe. Start a fire in an open area with dry leaves or twigs, and use soft woods like pine or birch to keep it burning steadily. Hardwoods like hickory are best for a long-lasting fire with hot coals.

To start a fire outdoors, follow these steps. Begin by creating a grate using slender kindling sticks across the two upper large sticks. Then, place larger sticks at right angles over the grate, layering them to form a log-cabin structure about one foot high. Light the fire from beneath the tinder pile. If it's raining and you can't find dry wood, stay positive and search for pine-knots or birch bark near a dead stump. Pine-knots work well in wet conditions. To build an outdoor fireplace, lay two green logs in a V-shape on the ground, leaving an open space for the fire in the middle. For cooking, place a frying pan and water pail on top of the logs over the fire. Always be cautious about forest fires by ensuring the fire is completely out before leaving the site.|"1.

In camp, a sturdy fireplace is essential for warmth and cooking. The fireplace is made of large green logs, stones, and earth, ensuring it lasts for many seasons. Logs are stacked like a log cabin, filled with earth and stones to secure them. Big stones line the top, raising the back higher than the front. The space inside is filled with earth, where the fire is built. If a permanent fireplace is not available, a large cook-fire can serve as a social gathering spot. It's important to have plenty of firewood on hand, replenishing it daily and keeping it dry. For meals, simple flapjacks and biscuits can be easily made over the fire. Flapjacks are cooked in a pan, while biscuits can be baked or spiraled around a stick and cooked over the fire. Watch carefully to avoid burning them.|"1.

In camp, a sturdy fireplace is essential for warmth and cooking. The fireplace is made of large green logs, stones, and earth, ensuring it lasts for many seasons. Logs are stacked like a log cabin, filled with earth and stones to secure them. Big stones line the top, raising the back higher than the front. The space inside is filled with earth, where the fire is built. If a permanent fireplace is not available, a large cook-fire can serve as a social gathering spot. It's important to have plenty of firewood on hand, replenishing it daily and keeping it dry. For meals, simple flapjacks and biscuits can be easily made over the fire. Flapjacks are cooked in a pan, while biscuits can be baked or spiraled around a stick and cooked over the fire. Watch carefully to avoid burning them.|"6. How are biscuits cooked over the fire?

To maintain good health while camping, it is crucial to keep your bowels open. One way is to drink licorice dissolved in water as a natural laxative. Additionally, drinking plenty of water throughout the day, especially before breakfast and at night, helps cleanse your body. Including fresh fruits in your daily meals aids in digestion.

When possible, it's a good idea to pack your smaller items in wall-pockets with compartments secured by flaps over the open ends. Roll these pockets, tie them, and place them in your camp pack. These pockets are handy at camp and help you keep your things organized. Alternatively, you can use small labeled bags for different types of belongings and place them in tube-shaped duffel bags. These bags can be tied together to form one pack. Girls usually carry between eighteen to twenty-four pounds, depending on their strength and endurance. Avoid overloading yourself, as packs get heavier on the trail. For short overnight trips from camp, you can carry essential items in your blanket-roll. Arrange your items on the blankets, roll them tightly, and wear the blanket-roll diagonally across your back and chest. Items for general use at camp can be packed in duffel bags, with provisions ideally in a separate bag. Consider using labeled tube bags of the same diameter for different food items, all stored in a larger duffel bag. Camp packs like duffel bags, harnesses, and tump-lines can be purchased at outfitters. For a wilderness camp, guides may be needed to help with carrying due to the lack of vehicles or animals. Despite the challenges, camping in the wilderness offers unique experiences and opportunities for crafting useful items from natural materials found in the surroundings.

In the meadows and near thickets, you may spot a unique creature known as the kangaroo-rat or jumping mouse. Resembling a kangaroo due to its hind legs, it leaps gracefully. Unlike typical rats, it is gentle and can be handled safely. The pocket-gopher, larger than a mole, burrows in fields with strong front feet for digging. It shares a fierce rivalry with the weasel. The coyote, similar to a large dog, is gray and cowardly but evokes sympathy when harmed. The spermophile, or ground-squirrel, frequents villages in Indiana. Prairie-dogs in the west are comical creatures. Meadow-larks sing cheerfully in spring, while the red-winged blackbird's call echoes in marshes. These diverse animals add charm to our natural world.|"6. What animal in the text is mentioned as singing cheerfully in spring?

Along sandy and stony shores, and occasionally further inland, you can discover the beach plum. This shrub grows in clusters and bears sweet fruit when fully ripe, often abundant and used for preserves. The plum's color ranges from red to red-purple with a powdery coating, hanging on a slender stem. Its stone is thin, rounded on one side and sharp on the other, usually with pointed ends. Ripening in August and September, the oval leaves have sharp tips, rounded bases, and fine teeth pointing forward. Meanwhile, the wild red cherry, sour yet edible, is great for preserves. Found in northern woods and mountains down to Tennessee, it features oblong leaves, bright green and glossy, with small white flowers in clusters. Lastly, the sand-cherry, growing along the eastern coast and sometimes near the Great Lakes, is a low bush yielding dark red-black fruit.

The tree typically stands between thirty to fifty feet tall, with reports of it reaching even one hundred feet in certain areas. Its trunk is short and its branches spread out. In the southern regions, it often forms thickets in uncultivated fields and along roadsides. The bark is dark brown or dark gray, with a scaly surface divided into plates. The leaves are narrow ovals with smooth edges, dark green and glossy on top, and pale and sometimes downy underneath when mature. The flower is creamy-white or greenish-yellow. Another fruit I was familiar with as a child is the papaw, also known as custard-apple due to its soft custard-like flesh. The papaw resembles a banana in shape but is shorter and thicker, usually three to five inches long. It ripens in September and October, found as far south as Florida and Texas, through the Middle States to Michigan and Kansas. The May-apple, or mandrake, is a delicious wild fruit, sweet and juicy but best eaten sparingly due to its laxative properties. It is most common in the Middle States and reaches its peak in Ohio. The plant grows to about twelve to eighteen inches in height, with large umbrella-like leaves on smooth, straight stems. The fruit, yellow and lemon-shaped, is about the size of a plum and ripens in July, becoming soft and quite flavorful when ripe.|"1.

The _chestnut-tree_ is a familiar sight in American cities, known for its sweet nuts encased in prickly burrs that fall to the ground after the first frost. In midsummer, cream-white blossoms adorn the tree's branches, making it easy to spot. The tree's leaves are large, toothed, and veined, drooping from a central point. On the other hand, the _slippery-elm_ tree is recognized by its glutinous inner bark and root, offering a nutty flavor. This tree grows up to seventy feet with spreading branches resembling a champagne glass. Its leaves are oblong and toothed, with a fragrant inner bark and rough texture in all directions. Lastly, the _sassafras_ tree, found from Massachusetts to Florida, boasts dark red-brown bark and aromatic qualities in its bark, wood, roots, stems, and leaves. The tree's fruit is berry-like, attracting birds with its glossy, dark blue appearance.|"3. What is a distinctive characteristic of the sassafras tree's bark?

The Adirondack and North Woods area is popular for outdoor activities, but it's also home to pesky insects like the black-fly. This tiny fly, also known as the buffalo-fly in the west, is about one-sixth of an inch long, black, and has a proboscis to draw blood. It can be a nuisance from early spring until mid-July or August. Another tiny pest is the no-see-um, a minuscule midge similar to a mosquito but almost invisible. They are active day and night and disappear with the black-fly. To relieve bites from these insects, applying camphor, alcohol, or diluted ammonia can help. In Pennsylvania mountains, gnats can be bothersome by flying into eyes, but they can be easily removed by pulling the upper eyelid over the lower one. Bees and wasps can also be troublesome, especially hornets that sting fiercely. If stung, remove the stinger and apply mud to reduce inflammation. Dopes like Nessmuk's Dope can also repel insects when applied to the skin.|"1. What is the main topic of the text?

The moccasin snake found in the southern regions of the United States does not coil before attacking. Instead, it vibrates its tail slowly and keeps its mouth open while hunting. It is commonly spotted near bayous and swamps, either partially submerged in water or resting on logs and branches over water. The moccasin's bite is highly venomous, making it a dangerous snake. However, most snakes in the U.S. are non-venomous. Remember, snakes with lengthwise stripes running from head to tail are harmless. Snakes like the blacksnake may look intimidating but are non-venomous. It is unnecessary and cruel to kill every snake encountered just because it is a snake. When identifying venomous snakes like the rattlesnake, copperhead, and cottonmouth, look for the pit, a distinct cavity between the nostrils and eyes. If bitten by a venomous snake, immediate first aid is crucial, including slashing the wound and sucking out the poison if there are no mouth injuries.|"1.

Some suggest using a hot iron to cauterize a wound, but act swiftly and _without fear_. Fear can harm the patient and spread. Remember, a snake bite is rarely deadly, and a swollen limb doesn't mean it's hopeless. While we might assume everyone knows poison ivy, that's not always true. Once, a city visitor unknowingly carried the vine, risking poisoning. We warned her, and she dropped it and hurried off. Some are immune to ivy, luckily including me. Others are sensitive, possibly due to fear. Poison oak looks like ivy but has oval leaves with blunt teeth. Poison sumac, found in wet areas, has gray berries, unlike harmless sumac. Remedies like witch-hazel, baking soda paste, or alcohol can help. Yellow lady's-slipper, a sweet orchid, can affect some like poison ivy.|"1. What is the author's advice when cauterizing a wound?

Some suggest using a hot iron to cauterize a wound, but act swiftly and _without fear_. Fear can harm the patient and spread. Remember, a snake bite is rarely deadly, and a swollen limb doesn't mean it's hopeless. While we might assume everyone knows poison ivy, that's not always true. Once, a city visitor unknowingly carried the vine, risking poisoning. We warned her, and she dropped it and hurried off. Some are immune to ivy, luckily including me. Others are sensitive, possibly due to fear. Poison oak looks like ivy but has oval leaves with blunt teeth. Poison sumac, found in wet areas, has gray berries, unlike harmless sumac. Remedies like witch-hazel, baking soda paste, or alcohol can help. Yellow lady's-slipper, a sweet orchid, can affect some like poison ivy.|"2.

The plant known as pokeweed is a tall annual with dark green triangular leaves that have wavy edges. It produces white flowers in clusters and black, smooth berries that grow at the end of drooping stems. Although birds eat its berries and its young shoots are said to taste like asparagus, it is a poisonous plant. The root is the most toxic part, and it is essential not to mistake it for edible plants. Another poisonous plant to be cautious of is poison-hemlock, historically known for its role in Socrates's death. Its stem is smooth and purplish-red, with large parsley-like leaves and small white flowers. Jimson-weed, a smelly plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in various colors, is common across the United States and can be harmful if its seeds are ingested.|"1.

One company that provides camping gear promotes a canoe named the Sponson, which features air-chambers called sponsons along the outside rail. The design of these air-chambers is said to make the canoe nearly impossible to capsize, even when filled with water, and capable of supporting heavy loads. Sponsons can be bought separately and adjusted to fit various canoe sizes. For beginners, sponsons offer safety and ease in learning to paddle without fear of tipping over. Additionally, there are guide canoes specifically designed for hunting and fishing, known for their sturdiness, flat bottoms, ability to carry heavy loads, ease of paddling or poling, and stability in rough waters. Prices for quality canoes typically range from twenty-eight to forty dollars, with higher prices not necessarily indicating better quality. Paddles made of different woods like red oak, maple, ash, spruce, and cherry are available in various lengths, with spruce preferred for regular use and harder woods recommended for rough waters. Care for canoes is crucial, including proper lifting, storage, and maintenance to prevent damage. When entering a canoe, it should be brought parallel to the shore, stepping in carefully to maintain balance and using the paddle for support if needed. Balancing and cautious movements are essential in canoeing to avoid tipping over. Changing positions while in the canoe is not recommended; instead, it's advised to land and switch positions on the shore if necessary.|"1.

When learning how to tie knots, understanding the different bends is crucial. There are three main types: the bight, the loop, and the round turn. The bight is created by bending the rope so that the sides are parallel. The loop is made by lapping one rope of the bight across the other. The round turn involves carrying one rope of the loop all the way around to the other side, making half of the loop double. One common knot is the square knot, which starts with a single tie where one end goes over the other and then under it. Then, the ends are brought together, and the same end goes over the other once more. This creates a secure square knot. Another useful knot is the figure-eight knot, which is great for securing the end of a rope or preventing strands from untwisting.|"1.

"When you need to create a loop without securing it to anything, use the overhand method of tying. First, measure enough rope for the loop and mark the spot with your left hand. Next, throw the short end over the long rope with your right hand. Then, bring the long rope up to form a loop over the end with your left hand. Pass the end through the loop and behind the long rope above the loop from right to left. Finally, slip the end downward through the loop, tighten the knot, and it won't slip even under strain. 

For loops passed around something or through a ring, like when hitching a horse or cow, use the underhand method. Slip the rope through the ring from left to right while holding the long rope in your left hand. Take a half-hitch around the long rope, passing the end over and under it. Transfer the loop from the short rope to the long rope by pulling up with the right hand. Tighten the knot by pulling on both the long rope and the short end. 

The sheep-shank knot is handy for temporarily shortening a rope without cutting it. Sailors use it to withstand strain without slipping.

One of the simplest knots to start with when tying up a parcel is the single-tie knot. Begin by making a knot about an inch from the end of your twine, using the single tie like _F_ (Fig. 65). If the knot isn't large enough, use the figure-eight knot. Wrap your twine around the parcel once, overlapping the long twine over the knotted end. Bring the knotted end over the long twine, forming a bight, then over and under its own twine with the single tie (_H_). Tighten the tie close to the knot to prevent slipping. To secure the cross-line, loop the long twine under the first twine to form a bight (_I_, Fig. 66). Finish by tying it securely to the first twine where it began. The fisherman's knot is used to tie silkworm gut together, easily untied by pulling the short ends. For a temporary fastening, use a timber-hitch.|"1.

While hiking, it's crucial to prevent accidents, but being prepared for emergencies is equally important. For sprains and bruises, apply hot water-soaked cloths to reduce soreness and inflammation. If hot water isn't available, cold water can be used. In case of a sprained ankle or wrist, continue the hot water treatment and then wrap with a clean bandage. To carry an injured person using the fireman's lift, have them relax their muscles, lift them to their feet, and carry them away. For minor cuts, clean the wound, press the sides together, and use strips of plaster to keep it closed. In case of a serious cut on an artery, apply pressure above the wound and use a tourniquet to stop bleeding, but remember not to keep it on for more than an hour to avoid cutting off circulation.|"1.

In the event of an accident, call for medical help promptly. If a doctor is not nearby, transport the injured person to the closest medical professional to address the issue of the artery needing to be tied urgently. Moving the patient on foot is not advisable due to the risk of re-bleeding, so it's essential to create an improvised stretcher using two sturdy poles, a large blanket, and safety pins. If blankets are unavailable, cut a khaki skirt into strips to fashion a makeshift stretcher. For burns, avoid using oil or flour; instead, cool the affected area with running water to alleviate pain and prevent further damage. In case of fainting, ensure the person lies flat with raised feet, provide fresh air, and apply cold water while seeking medical help. If something gets in the eye, avoid inserting anything hard; use eyelashes to clean the eye or seek professional assistance if needed. If someone is rescued from water and not breathing, focus on restoring respiration before addressing warmth and circulation.|"1.

Moving the patient on foot is not advisable due to the risk of re-bleeding, so it's essential to create an improvised stretcher using two sturdy poles, a large blanket, and safety pins. If blankets are unavailable, cut a khaki skirt into strips to fashion a makeshift stretcher. For burns, avoid using oil or flour; instead, cool the affected area with running water to alleviate pain and prevent further damage. In case of fainting, ensure the person lies flat with raised feet, provide fresh air, and apply cold water while seeking medical help. If something gets in the eye, avoid inserting anything hard; use eyelashes to clean the eye or seek professional assistance if needed. If someone is rescued from water and not breathing, focus on restoring respiration before addressing warmth and circulation.|"2.

In a camp, fun activities await! For the winner of a race, a medal can be crafted from a tin can lid. Simply drive a nail through it, attach a string, and hang it around the neck. Alternatively, crown the victor with a leafy wreath, a nod to ancient Greek traditions. Another exciting game is the blindfold obstacle walk. Set up stones with cups of water on top, two feet apart. Blindfold a player, have guards guide her hands, and challenge her to navigate the stones without spilling. This game is similar to hide-and-seek, where players hide and the hunter tries to find them. Lastly, try wood tennis using pine cones as balls, hands as rackets, and branches as a net on a court outlined in the earth. Enjoy these outdoor games!|"1.

To start a fire using primitive tools, you need a bow, a twirling-stick, and a fireboard. The twirling-stick should be made of spruce, about sixteen inches long and a little over half an inch in diameter. Cut the top end to a blunt point and sharpen the bottom end. Use a socket-block made of soapstone or hard wood to hold the spindle. The fireboard should be about two feet long and less than an inch thick, with triangular notches on one edge for the twirling-stick. These notches create a fire pit. Prepare tinder from baked and blackened cotton and linen rags, ensuring they are absolutely dry. Use the bow to twirl the spindle on the fireboard rapidly to create friction and heat, which will produce a spark to ignite the tinder for a flame.|"1.

Fig. 78 illustrates a technique similar to Fig. 77, but without the bow. Instead, hands are used to spin the spindle. This method, while simpler, requires considerable effort and speed to create fire, making it a challenging and tiring process. Another approach, as depicted in Fig. 79, involves two individuals. One girl holds the spindle and stabilizes the fireboard, while the other pulls a leather shoe-string back and forth to rotate the spindle. Producing fire using the plough method is more complex than with a bow but achievable. All that is needed is a fireboard with a groove and a rubbing-stick (Fig. 80). A fire-saw can be fashioned from an old bamboo fishing-rod. By cutting and sharpening the bamboo, sparks can be created by sawing through it. This method requires coordination between two individuals, one holding the bamboo steady while the other saws (Fig. 81). By placing tinder on a dry leaf and fanning the sparks, a flame can be ignited. Planning engaging activities for camp Sundays is crucial to ensure everyone enjoys the day to the fullest. Emphasizing physical, mental, and spiritual well-being is essential for a fulfilling experience.|"1. What is the main difference between the technique illustrated in Fig. 78 and Fig. 77?

Producing fire using the plough method is more complex than with a bow but achievable. All that is needed is a fireboard with a groove and a rubbing-stick (Fig. 80). A fire-saw can be fashioned from an old bamboo fishing-rod. By cutting and sharpening the bamboo, sparks can be created by sawing through it. This method requires coordination between two individuals, one holding the bamboo steady while the other saws (Fig. 81). By placing tinder on a dry leaf and fanning the sparks, a flame can be ignited. Planning engaging activities for camp Sundays is crucial to ensure everyone enjoys the day to the fullest. Emphasizing physical, mental, and spiritual well-being is essential for a fulfilling experience.|"3. What is emphasized as essential for a fulfilling experience in planning camp Sundays activities?
