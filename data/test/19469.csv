In the distance, a rumble fills the air, like a lion awakening. A cloud unfurls rapidly, a sign of hope. Soldiers charge ahead, bayonets gleaming, and riders dash like the wind. Raise the flag, shout for freedom and victory! Comrades rally, their resolve reignited. They face the enemy with courage. The battle is fierce, but we prevail! Yet, a heaviness weighs on my heart, words fail me. A soldier holds onto something deeper than duty. Ask a mother, a loved one, what drives them. A soldier's flag, untarnished, a symbol of pride. Uncle Jared, if you must tell her, ease the truth. Life fades, but I go willingly. Raise the flag over me, for country and God. Earthly treasures fade, but acts of kindness endure. What we give selflessly, we truly keep. The icy hand of death lingers, unanswered. A warrior's sacrifice, a loved one's grief.|"1. What is the main theme of the text passage?

The sacred hearth stays unchanged, echoing children's voices once more. The sun shines through the window, but different feet now tread the old kitchen floor. Sam set out on a dark night to court old Jones's daughter, his heart pounding against his waistcoat. Despite his nerves, he mustered the courage to pop the question, knowing he couldn't live without her. As he approached the house, trembling, he urged himself on, determined not to let doubt and fear overtake him. Sam entered the house, praising Jones's crops, trying to impress Kitty. After the old folks retired, Sam and Kitty found themselves drawn closer, and Sam's boldness grew.

Cheer, elderly leaders; cheer loudly, I say; It's the race of a lifetime witnessed today! Though you live twice the time given to men, You will never witness such a grand race again. Let the cheers of the crowd roar like the waves, For Salvator, Salvator, king of the racetrack, He has matched the record of thirteen long years; He has claimed the top spot among his peers. It was a close race, an honest and grand event, Even his rivals acknowledge his achievement. Let old records be surpassed, And display 2:05 for all to see! I'd like to roam the vast plains like the Native Americans! I'd like to be a pirate and sail the raging sea! And conquer a large island, ruling in grandeur; But I can't do anything because I have to attend school. Many great men, as I have read, were those who had The least education by a flickering pine knot; And many daring boys like me grow up to be foolish, And never amount to anything because they have to go to school. I'd like to be a cowboy and lasso the Texas cattle! I'd like to be a detective or a fierce pirate! And leave the enemies to suffer where their blood forms a pool; But how can I become famous? Because I have to go to school. I don't understand how my parents can make the mistake Of holding back a boy like me who has a name to make!|"1. What is the main theme of the text passage?

My heart is tender like a woman's, thinking of the steep and stony paths my loved ones must tread. The mountains of sin loom over them, fate's storms rage wild, yet nothing on earth is as pure as a child's heart. They are angels in disguise, teaching me gentleness and strength. I pray to shield them from harm, but prayers rebound. My heart is their sanctuary, my love their guiding light. As autumn nears, I'll miss their good-nights, innocent laughter, and morning flowers. Their absence will leave a void, their voices and footsteps a memory. When lessons end and death beckons, I hope they gather to bid me good-night. Remember, try and try again, even if you fail. The noble race of the past lives on in the waters, forests, and mountains, their legacy etched in the land's very soul.|"1.

My heart is tender like a woman's, thinking of the steep and stony paths my loved ones must tread. The mountains of sin loom over them, fate's storms rage wild, yet nothing on earth is as pure as a child's heart. They are angels in disguise, teaching me gentleness and strength.

The loyal dog was the last, but the Ark was too crowded for him to find a place. He stood with half in, half out, enduring the rain for nine hundred hours. His nose became cold and damp, never to lose the chill. The passage then shifts to a captive warrior, proud and noble, now bound by chains. Despite offering gold and pleading for freedom, he is condemned to be a Christian's slave. The warrior's heart breaks, and he meets a tragic end at the hands of a hyena.

We refuse to waver, whether facing many swords or few, until we establish a new order of worship on Earth. We refuse to accept a lower law than ""Brotherhood"" or a lesser Lord than God. As we march towards Armageddon, let's remain steadfast and help usher in a new era. Let's not question the difficult path we tread, for God will reveal His plan when our spirits are ready. Let's play our part today and aid God in helping mankind. Let's not curse the madness that dooms us to the sorrow of human hatred. Let's show perfect mercy to those we must defeat, forgive our enemies, and even if we fall, let forgiveness prevail.

E) The Gulf Stream"|D) The nation's fate|Yes
In about ten million years, the sun's heat will fade, causing the universe to perish. This worried a man greatly. Scientists predicted Earth falling into the sun, leading to its demise. The man fretted over the shrinking space and the Gulf Stream altering. He feared for the future, where resources like lumber and coal would deplete, bringing back the ice age. Despite his concerns, he didn't fret about his wife's laundry work or his daughter sewing shirts to pay the grocer. The man marveled at the President's modesty and the power he held. The President's actions and decisions influenced the nation's fate. As the Ship of State navigated through storms, the President guided it with justice and faith. The man honored the President's role in maintaining peace and aiding other nations in need. The poem ends with a call to respect and support the President's leadership.|"5.

"In the thicket, the cricket sings a tune, fireflies dream, and frogs chorus by the river. It's time for the baby to sleep, playing 'possum with big brown eyes.
