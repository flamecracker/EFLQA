In the village, all warriors had a common tattoo. Ralph inquired about this practice, and John explained that tattoos were a way to decorate and distinguish individuals. Chiefs had unique tattoos to denote their rank. The names of warriors were descriptive, like Sitting Bull and Rain in the Face. Blakely organized the warriors with the help of Ralsea and Sutoto. The Professor welcomed Chief Suros from the south with a party of thirty men. They planned to teach the tribe new skills and build relationships. The boys, Jim and Will, assisted the Professor, impressed by the natives' quick learning abilities. Despite their agility, the natives seemed to remain stagnant in progress.|"6.

"The teacher smiled at the comment and responded, ""Sir John Lubbock, a famous English naturalist, described the savage mind as having the traits of both children and adults. Their simplicity can be a weakness, but if properly guided, they can become strong individuals."" Many writers believe that savages lack a clear and concise set of laws, as orderliness is not a priority for them. They tend to focus on immediate needs, much like children. Although their reasoning skills are not lacking, they are not fully developed. Jim's insight was accurate, as Blakely discovered when dealing with the natives. By uniting them for common defense, they became more effective. Sutoto, a key figure, brought news that the tribes were moving eastward. The Professor, along with chiefs Oma and Suros, worked on uniting the tribes and establishing a government that suited everyone. During their journey, hunters captured two Kurabus, including one they had previously treated kindly. John, feeling betrayed, confronted them sternly. The group continued their preparations for defense, making weapons and readying the wagon for the journey ahead."|"1. What did Sir John Lubbock describe as traits of the savage mind?

"Before four o'clock, the allies were taken by surprise as they crossed a stream near the Cataract River. Blakely's forces, strategically placed on higher ground, blocked their path. John and Ralsea emerged, urging the allies to release their captives for peace. The allies, visibly alarmed, agreed to hold a council.

Muro believed patience would resolve the situation with the Illyas without violence, but he had a different view on the Tuolos. The shop and laboratory were finished, and the treasure was secured in an underground vault. The Professor scouted for copper in the hills to the north.

To ensure fair transactions, a system of coins was introduced among the warriors. Each coin had a set value, and they were given as rewards for their work. The warriors were then able to use these coins to purchase goods like cloth. This new form of barter intrigued the natives, who quickly grasped the concept.

By introducing them to a new way of earning and spending, the Professor hoped to foster a sense of economic independence and cooperation among the tribes.|"1.

A group of warriors, well-prepared with supplies and ammunition, departed the village towards the north for easier travel. Their plan was to head west and cross a river to meet the Brabos on the other side. John and his companions discussed their previous encounters with the Tuolos and strategized their approach. Scouts spotted signs of the Tuolos, prompting caution. As night fell, Muro returned with news of a feast and potential sacrifices by the Tuolos. The group decided to investigate and prevent any harm.

Before they reached the entrance, a loud noise outside caught their attention, and their own people were seen scurrying back and forth. As they stepped out, three oddly dressed locals crossed their path. In the native tongue, John commanded them to stop, and they hesitated. The boys aimed their guns, and the natives yielded as Muro and his group hurried over. Quickly, they were escorted down to the wagon. It appeared that when the Krishnos returned from the village, they stumbled upon the camp, triggering the guards. If they had made it to the cave, their superstitions would have kept them out, but outside they had no such qualms. Luckily, John and the boys were there to block their entry. As they descended the hill, John displayed a unique stone cross he had found in the cave. The cross, a symbol dating back thousands of years, was used by ancient civilizations like the Babylonians, Persians, Hittites, and Egyptians. The camp remained calm, but the scouts monitored the situation closely. Muro was confident the Krishnos wouldn't abandon their village without a fight. While John conversed with the Krishnos, he subtly lit a match, causing them to believe the Great Spirit was displeased with their lies. The Krishnos were frightened, realizing their deceit was exposed, and they were led back to the village to convey John's message to the chiefs in Muro's presence.|"1.

Muro and the warriors stayed back with guns, while the Krishnos entered the village. After waiting silently, a commotion arose, growing louder. The boys recognized the hut where they were held captive and rescued. Ralph pointed it out to John, explaining it was where they were found. A tense situation unfolded as Muro instructed the guards.

George and Jim, along with a few other men, were busy constructing chairs and tables for the houses, while the women continued weaving cloth. The women, accompanied by their children, were welcomed by the Professor and assigned to the cottages. Each family was expected to pay for their home and make the surroundings appealing by planting flowers. The workers were encouraged to be self-sufficient, with families providing their own food to earn more coins. This led to some resorting to dishonest means to acquire coins, but the Professor emphasized honesty. When a thief was caught, a trial was held where the accused was allowed to defend themselves. The thief was found guilty and had to work without pay for two moons and repay the stolen goods if caught again.

When the group exited the cave at 4 a.m., they were exhausted but carried a significant amount of treasure comparable to what was found near the Cataract. The next morning, the Tuolos were chosen, and their chief was welcomed into a wagon. John freed the Krishnos from the large hut, surprising them with their newfound freedom.

Osaga, the chief, needed laws for the land within their territory to avoid conflict. The idea was for Osaga to receive compensation and transfer land rights to the State. The State would oversee individual territories, ensuring protection and orderly land transactions. Uraso embraced this concept enthusiastically, highlighting the benefits. The focus shifted to the expedition to the Illyas, with preparations underway. Marmo faced resistance from some warriors engrossed in factory work. Despite initial doubts, Marmo observed unity among tribes and innovation in crafting new items. The Krishnos, under the Professor's care, were content and unwilling to leave due to the captivating environment.|"6. Why were the Krishnos content and unwilling to leave?

"One evening, the Professor noticed a Tuolo worker sneaking up to the laboratory. The worker, after cautiously surveying the area, timidly entered and humbly asked to speak. ""I'm puzzled why my warriors aren't interested in war. They prefer learning about machinery and making things. The White Chief allows you to bring your family here, but remember your people.
