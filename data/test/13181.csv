In the factory, the workers explained to Hamilton the meticulous process of ensuring the quality of their gun barrels. They use heavy charges to test the barrels thoroughly, as they sell guns worldwide, including in countries like England with strict standards. The 'proof-room' subjects the barrels to extreme strain to guarantee their durability. Hamilton was then shown various machines used to prepare gun parts with precision, down to the thousandth of an inch. The workers meticulously gauged each piece to fit perfectly using a double gauge system. The guide also revealed the process of coloring or bluing steel parts to give them a distinctive bluish look, comparing the traditional charcoal method with the modern, more efficient system using revolving ovens.

Hamilton quickly gathered his materials and started filling out the necessary information for the Census of Manufactures. The milliner he was interviewing was cooperative until she became indignant at the question about the number of hours worked. Despite this, Hamilton managed to gather valuable data on wages paid. However, he hit a roadblock when inquiring about the cost of raw materials used, especially for retail work. The milliner was unable to provide this information due to the nature of her business. With some clever thinking, Hamilton managed to estimate the cost by involving a customer in the process. Eventually, he completed the schedule with the help of the night superintendent in a glass factory. Despite facing challenges, Hamilton persevered in his census-taking duties, even drawing inspiration from a poet's words as he navigated the complexities of the task.|"1.

In the United States, child labor has been a pressing issue, with over a hundred thousand children aged six to fourteen working in factories last year.

In the lesson, Hamilton explained the codes used on census cards. For example, 'S' means Single, 'M' for Married, 'Wd' for Widowed, 'D' for Divorced, and 'Un' for Unknown. The term 'Mother Tongue' refers to the primary language spoken by a person. In Wales, the mother tongue is Welsh, but not everyone speaks it. So, an English-speaking Welshman's card would be marked 'OL' for Other Language. Similarly, in Denmark, if German is the second most important language after Danish, a person speaking German as their native language would be marked 'OL' on the card. The codes 'U.S.' and 'Un.' represent birthplace and unknown parentage. 'NP' and 'FP' stand for native-born and foreign-born parents.

Hamilton spent the afternoon working diligently on a set of cards, grasping the principles behind the task. The next morning, he found a real schedule at his machine, ready to go. He was warned that errors were not allowed, and each card had to be accounted for. The machine's operator explained the importance of correct numbering on the cards. As Hamilton grew more comfortable with the machine, he explored the verification department to understand its workings. The chief explained that the machine used mercury to transmit electric currents for verification. Hamilton learned that each card's unique combination of holes ensured accuracy. The machine could detect 23 different errors, like mismatched data, to ensure the cards were correct.|"1. What was Hamilton working on diligently?

Hamilton and the chief were discussing the process of handling punched cards for tabulation. The chief explained that any field without a punch in every card would be rejected, except for the age column which required a punch in every field. The cards were checked against original schedules, and any errors were corrected by punching new cards. The cards were sorted using machinery, not by eyesight, saving time and labor. The chief described how the cards were kept organized by location, district, and state, simplifying the tabulating process. The tabulating machine used electrical connections to count and print data from the cards automatically. The supervisor showcased a new machine that fed, verified, and tabulated cards quickly, making the census process more efficient. Hamilton marveled at the technology, comparing it to magic to have the whole country's information stored on punched cards.|"1. What was the purpose of punching cards for tabulation?

In Alaska, the men of the service faced extreme weather conditions, trekking hundreds of miles in temperatures as low as 70 degrees below zero. The lack of beaten trails meant they had to snow-shoe ahead of their dog-teams. Despite the isolation and harsh conditions, these men visited remote prospectors' cabins and claims, making sacrifices to deliver supplies. One enumerator survived on fresh meat, facing freezing temperatures and dangerous terrain. Another man got caught in a blizzard but was rescued just in time. Traveling in Alaska meant enduring bitter cold, treacherous rivers, and navigating trackless wilderness. The challenges were immense, with no beaten trails or bridges across swollen rivers. The stories of survival and sacrifice in Alaska's unforgiving landscape are truly awe-inspiring.|"1. What extreme weather conditions did the men of the service face in Alaska?

"The Census Bureau is a bustling place with work happening before and after the Decennial Census. Besides the main census, there are other important tasks like the Quinquennial Census of Manufactures and tracking Religious Bodies, Marriage, and Divorce Statistics. The Bureau compiles vital statistics useful for doctors worldwide and studies cotton crop conditions. They also handle statistics for cities over 30,000 inhabitants and assist with questions related to population and manufacturing. The Bureau collaborates on forest product statistics and provides data requested by Congress or executive departments. Editing schedules, like those from Alaska, can be fascinating due to unique entries, such as an Eskimo girl listed with ""Sun"" and ""Sea"" as parents. Enumerators encounter interesting descriptions like an Indian's age noted as ""200 snows,"" which required some deciphering.
