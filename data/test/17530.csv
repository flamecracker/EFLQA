It snowed all night and the next morning, with fewer kids going to school. When the sun came out at two o'clock, the children filled the streets with shovels, brooms, and snowballs flying. Maida watched as Rosie's red cape and hat turned white with snow, her black hair and brows adorned with flakes. Rosie's cheeks were coral-colored, her eyes like velvety moons. Billy gathered everyone in the yard and instructed them to pile the snow in one corner. With Billy and Arthur swiftly shoveling, Maida, Rosie, and Dicky hopped around. The snow-pile grew, reaching the fence top. Billy warned about the roof caving in and began digging a room. The roof collapsed on him, but they rebuilt the structure, creating a snow dwelling.

Billy carefully assembled the snowman, placing the legs in one corner and rolling the big round body onto them. Adding the arms proved tricky, but after some effort, they were attached just right. Everyone pitched in to create the snowman's features. Maida used dulse for hair, Rosie found a clothes-pin for the nose, Dicky used coals for eyes, and Arthur crafted teeth from orange peels. The snowman was dressed in an old coat, a tall hat, and even had a pipe in its mouth. As the finishing touch, Billy added a cane and gave the snowman a jaunty tilt to its head.

Maida and her friends climbed the hill again, watching kids sled down the coast in various ways. Some went alone, others in pairs, and a few even used unconventional items like shovels and brooms for sledding. Rosie generously lent her sled to those without one.

On a Monday morning, Maida rushed to the window filled with worry about what she might witness. Instead of the expected thaw, a breathtaking scene unfolded before her eyes. The previous night's cold weather had caused everything that had begun to melt to freeze once more. The sidewalks resembled frosted cakes, adorned with long icicles framing the rooftops. The trees and bushes were coated in a layer of crystal. Sunlight danced through this icy wonderland, turning the world into a treasure trove of diamonds. By the afternoon, Mr. Chumpleigh appeared to be drooping, and by nightfall, his head was sadly resting on his shoulder. The next morning, all that remained in the corner was a heap of snow with scattered items like an old coat, a hat, gloves, a pipe, and a cane. A sign made by Billy, with red and gold lettering, hung in Maida's window for a week, depicting a charming Christmas scene that captured the attention of children and adults alike. The sign brought joy to Maida, who noticed a decrease in her trade as children saved their coins for the fair. Arthur worked tirelessly on a more intricate project, the sound of his hammering echoing into Maida's room early in the morning and sometimes late at night. Granny praised the hard work of the children, drawing a heartwarming parallel to her own daughter, Annie, who was always busy with Christmas preparations.|"1.
