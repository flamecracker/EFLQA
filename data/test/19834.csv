The Rosemont schools closed for the holidays at noon on the Wednesday before Christmas. The Mortons and Dorothy were free to bring Katharine from Hoboken using Mrs. Emerson's car. The family had a tradition of welcoming guests as if they belonged to all of them, not just one member. Helen, Roger, Dorothy, and Dicky joined to meet Katharine at the station.

The large Norway spruce tree stood proudly in front of the school, with a spacious lawn where many people gathered to admire. Choirs from local churches volunteered to sing from an elevated stand, leading the crowd in songs filled with brotherly love and cheer. The atmosphere was so beautiful that words seemed inadequate. A girl found hope in her heart, a pickpocket resisted temptation, and even babies reached out in wonder. The school children sang carols joyfully, their voices blending with the choir's, creating a magical moment. As the stars appeared, people lingered, reflecting on peace. Later, the U.S.C. rushed to the Mortons' for a quick dinner before heading to the Glen Point orphanage for a Christmas party.
