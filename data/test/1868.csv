The younger kids had left, and we wandered through the empty school, which wasn't inviting. In a room, we found a sad little boy locked in. I talked to him, feeling homesick seeing him like other boys in trouble. The concierge said they still followed Pestalozzi's methods in Yverdon schools. We then entered a room where ten-year-old girls studied. It had three windows, a platform, a teacher, and desks but no decorations. The only adornment was a colourful chart illustrating the dangers of fire and disobedience. It showed a boy named Charles starting a fire, with a girl warning against matches. Charles and other boys lit a fire, and a child fell in. The scene ended with villagers arriving too late.|"1. What did the narrator find in a room at the empty school?

"I was proud to have captured the attention of children in a foreign land, speaking a language they did not understand. As I heard footsteps approaching, I quickly commanded, ""_Asseyez-vous_, _mes enfants_, _tout-de-suite_!"" They obeyed instantly. We wandered through the village, dined at a quaint inn, and left for Geneva at seven in the September twilight. Arriving a bit tired, we visited a cake shop. The man thanked us for returning a tumbler, and I reminded him of the one franc fifty centimes. He laughed, and I tried to explain. We left, having contributed to French revenues. This was the end of our day in Pestalozzi-town, but not the end of the lemonade glass incident, a favorite tale in Salemina's stories. Venice has always been a city I wished to discover on my own, away from the constant acquisition of knowledge. If I had a daughter, I would want her to experience Venice without prior knowledge. Salemina is well-informed but forgets details at times, making her charming. Our accidental companion, Miss Celia Van Tyck, is too knowledgeable and lacks enthusiasm, unlike Salemina. She joined us in Florence, awaiting her niece Kitty Copley."|"1. What did the speaker do when they heard footsteps approaching in the foreign land?

"I was proud to have captured the attention of children in a foreign land, speaking a language they did not understand. As I heard footsteps approaching, I quickly commanded, ""_Asseyez-vous_, _mes enfants_, _tout-de-suite_!"" They obeyed instantly. We wandered through the village, dined at a quaint inn, and left for Geneva at seven in the September twilight. Arriving a bit tired, we visited a cake shop. The man thanked us for returning a tumbler, and I reminded him of the one franc fifty centimes. He laughed, and I tried to explain. We left, having contributed to French revenues. This was the end of our day in Pestalozzi-town, but not the end of the lemonade glass incident, a favorite tale in Salemina's stories. Venice has always been a city I wished to discover on my own, away from the constant acquisition of knowledge. If I had a daughter, I would want her to experience Venice without prior knowledge. Salemina is well-informed but forgets details at times, making her charming. Our accidental companion, Miss Celia Van Tyck, is too knowledgeable and lacks enthusiasm, unlike Salemina.

Miss Van Tyck was not the ideal companion for Venice, a city known for its charm and beauty. Despite our intentions to enter Venice by moonlight in a romantic manner, Miss Van insisted on accompanying us. Her presence was less than desirable, as she was preoccupied with reading about other cities like Verona and Padua, neglecting the beauty of Florence. As we arrived in Venice, the enchanting atmosphere was somewhat marred by her company. I cleverly arranged for her to be in a separate gondola, freeing myself from her dissonant remarks. Despite her attempts to engage me in the city's allure, I preferred to preserve my own impressions of Venice, refraining from sharing them with others. The historic significance of Venice, especially during Ascension Day, evoked images of past ceremonies and grandeur that I could vividly imagine as we approached the Piazza of San Marco. The memories of Venice's rich history and beauty were enough to captivate me, despite the lack of modern-day vibrancy and colour in our surroundings.|"1.

"Beppo sent a sharp criticism in verse to Peppina through the new gardener, and the Little Genius recited it to us, showcasing the poetic talent of the rejected lover. Beppo cleverly chose his rebuke from popular verses known to gondoliers and fishermen of Venice. Beppo, Salemina, and I were chatting one morning when Peppina passed by, carrying market baskets and looking radiant, with a crimson rose in her teeth. She playfully hummed a line from Beppo's poem, ""Trust not the mast that bends,"" as she glanced at Beppo. Despite Salemina's approval of Peppina's unconventional attire, I struggle with the lack of discipline. Our warm climate seems to erode the strict virtues instilled by harsh Boston winds.

Salemina believes we are living a light opera where we can relax and enjoy the show without responsibilities.

The group chatted and gestured excitedly, tangled in a web of misunderstandings. A clash between the sweetmeat vendor and the sausage seller set off a chain reaction, leading to chaos. The spry girl, keen on justice, found herself in the midst of the turmoil. The fritter lady, sweetmeat man, and sausage vendor engaged in a heated exchange of blame. The contralto, caught between family ties and love, intervened with a soup ladle. Insults flew, tempers flared, and chaos reigned until the Little Genius, with her blue pitcher broken, took charge.

During a delightful journey along the Thames, I explored villages with friends Kitty and Jack. They challenged me to rhyme Henley and Streatley before lunch, rewarding my efforts with laurel crowns and medals. At Datchett, water-rats watched us eat by the reeds. Medmenham Abbey posed a pronunciation puzzle. Jack's strict guidance led to poetic entries in inn Visitors’ Books. At Penygwryd, I faced challenging Welsh names. A quaint inn, Ty Ucha, served a feast with ham, ale, and cheese. Served by the innkeeper’s granddaughter, Nelw Evans, we felt the warmth of British hospitality. We left poetic marks in the inn’s “Locked Book” before continuing our journey to Bettws-y-Coed, where a humorous rhyme was carved for posterity.|"1.

During our journey, we stopped at the Royal Goat in Beddgelert. I decided to write a letter to Salemina, who stayed back in London due to a sprained ankle. I wanted to fill the letter with local color, so I created an exciting story using Welsh town names. We left Bettws-y-Coed and traveled thirty-three miles to our current location. As we passed through Portmadoc, we saw posters about a Festiniog event. The road became lively with people returning from the festival. Women wore colorful plaid Rhuddlans and straw Beddgelerts on their heads. The guard tooted his horn as we entered the village, where crowds gathered. Suddenly, a large black Llanrwst horse caused chaos, but the guard, Absalom, saved the day with a Capel Curig. We continued our journey to Bristol after a week of coaching in Wales, exploring various towns and landmarks.|"1. What was the reason for the letter the speaker wrote to Salemina?

The guard was labeling our carriage as ""engaged,"" loading up six lunch baskets, and off we went. Egeria's character captivated Mrs. Jack and me.

"Before Egeria joined our group, we thought we were a cheerful bunch, but she brought a new level of excitement. As we dashed around the Bristol station, about to board the first-class carriage reserved by our host, the scene was bustling. Tommy got us rosebuds for a penny each, while Atlas carried a stack of illustrated papers like _The Sketch_ and _Black and White_. The guard was labeling our carriage as ""engaged,"" loading up six lunch baskets, and off we went. Egeria's character captivated Mrs. Jack and me.

"Salemina, Francesca, and I are separated by vast distances, not just in space but in our lives and responsibilities. To stay connected, we started a unique three-way correspondence using a ""loose-leaf diary."" Each of us writes about our daily experiences, and every fortnight, we send a selection of pages to each other. Through this method, we maintain our friendship despite being far apart in America, Scotland, and Ireland. While discussing marriage, my husband cautioned against sharing too much, fearing our private thoughts might become public. Despite his reservations, I believe in the institution of marriage and the unique challenges women face in making a house a home.

We were having lunch on the veranda, surrounded by nature, on a sunny Buttercup Sunday in June.
