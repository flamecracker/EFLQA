"""We have chartered a small steamer,"" the manager announced. ""Originally, I planned to use a large motor boat for our trips to various places from the hotel. However, the distances turned out longer than expected, and it might be inconvenient to return to the hotel each time.

It arrived two days later, an old craft with a wheezy wood-burning engine and a paddle wheel at the stern to navigate shallow waters. The first part of our play will unfold aboard the steamer, moving slowly along a quiet stream lined with tall trees and Spanish moss. After filming scenes on board, we will head ashore to a picturesque grove of palms for the next part of our drama."""|"1. What is the name of the small steamer chartered by the manager?

The company enjoyed the tranquility interrupted by the harsh cries of passing waterfowl and the occasional appearance of saurians slipping into the water. Mr. Pertell decided to dock for the night at a picturesque spot, promising suitable scenery for their filming endeavors. The warm evening led to a light supper, followed by a relaxing time on deck as the night breeze provided relief from the stifling heat.|"1. What provided shade on the upper deck of the _Magnolia_?
