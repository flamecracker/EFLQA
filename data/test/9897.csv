Ancient Greeks primarily resided in cities due to their government and essential activities being centralized there. The cities were fortified with tall stone walls for protection, often enclosing a hill known as the acropolis where people sought refuge during attacks. In Athens, the acropolis rose 200 feet above the plain, housing stunning temples like the Parthenon. Unlike modern homes, Greek private houses were modest, with an emphasis on grand public structures like temples, theaters, and porticoes. Temples like the Parthenon were relatively small, with intricate columns and elaborate carvings. While the Parthenon now stands partially ruined, other Greek temples like the Theseum in Athens and those in Paestum, Italy, and Girgenti, Sicily, showcase the architectural influence they had on Roman and European constructions.|"1.

The Athenian government was unique in ancient Greece. Citizens had more involvement in their government than many Americans today. The great assembly, or _ecclesia_, required at least six thousand citizens to make decisions. Foreigners could be granted citizenship or citizens expelled through this assembly. A smaller council of five hundred dealt with less important matters. Members were chosen by lot, like our juries. A tenth of the council ruled for a tenth of the year, choosing their president daily by lot. Athenians also served as judges, with up to six thousand judges deciding cases. Socrates, a famous philosopher, was condemned to death by a court of five hundred and one judges. He questioned others about the true way to live, leading to his unjust death by drinking hemlock. His teachings were passed down by friends like Plato, enriching the world with their wisdom.|"1. What was the name of the great assembly in ancient Athens where decisions were made?

Greek settlers from ancient times ventured out to establish colonies in distant lands for various reasons, much like our ancestors who sought new opportunities in America. The Greeks sought advice from Apollo's priests at Delphi to choose the best locations for their new cities. They carried fire from their mother city to light the hearth of their new settlement. Close ties were maintained between the mother city and its colonies. The Greek sailors expanded their settlements to the Black Sea and later to Sicily and southern Italy, where they shared their knowledge with local tribes. The Greeks also settled in southern France and eastern Spain, founding Massilia (Marseilles), a key trading hub that connected the ancient world to Britain for tin supplies.|"1.

"The Samnites forced the Roman army, including both generals and soldiers, to walk ""under the yoke,"" which was made of two spears placed upright with another one laid across. The Samnites stood by and taunted them. If any Roman showed anger or sadness at the humiliation, they were hit or even killed.

The people of ancient Rome were divided into two main groups: the patricians, who were the nobles, and the plebeians, who were the common folk. The patricians initially held all the knowledge of the laws, which were not written down. This led to disputes between the patricians and plebeians, with the plebeians feeling that the laws were being changed unfairly. Twice, the plebeians protested by leaving the city until their grievances were addressed. Eventually, they forced the nobles to write down the laws in the Twelve Tables. Over time, the plebeians gained more rights and opportunities, moving up to become nobles themselves. The government of Rome was led by consuls, chosen each year to prevent one person from gaining too much power. Senators held significant influence, and assemblies generally followed their guidance. The Romans were strategic in dealing with conquered territories, allowing the conquered peoples to become Roman citizens and participate in governance. Rome faced serious threats from the Gauls and Carthaginians but prevailed due to their resilience and determination.|"1. What were the two main social groups in ancient Rome?

During the Middle Ages, there were two types of clergy: parish priests and monks. Parish priests led ordinary parishes, while monks lived in monasteries, dedicating themselves to prayer, fasting, and teaching. Monks sometimes isolated themselves from daily life to focus on spiritual practices, while other times they served as educators, spreading knowledge to underdeveloped communities. The Romans initially prohibited Christians from worshiping, punishing them for their beliefs. It took over a thousand years, from Constantine to Columbus, for emperors to allow Christians to worship freely. The Middle Ages marked significant changes in Europe, with the rise of new powers like the Moors, Turks, and Arabs. The era saw a shift in importance from Mediterranean to Atlantic countries, leading to the renaming of regions like Gaul to France and Britannia to England. The legacy of Greek and Roman civilization endured through the Middle Ages, influencing the knowledge carried by emigrants to America.|"6. What significant changes did the Middle Ages mark in Europe?

Long ago, the Goths, living north of the Danube, embraced Christianity under Bishop Ulfilas, who translated the Bible into Gothic, marking it as the oldest German text. This led other Germanic tribes to learn about Christianity. Despite being foes of the Roman government, they respected the Church. The Goths invaded the Roman Empire, causing havoc. Alaric, a Gothic leader, captured Rome in 410 but spared churches. As the Roman Empire weakened, German kings gained control of its provinces. England emerged as the Angles and Saxons from Germany invaded, forming Anglo-Saxon England. Constantinople remained relatively unchanged, with its sturdy walls enduring attacks. In contrast, Roman ruins in Italy and Western Europe crumbled, with buildings like the Colosseum repurposed. The world around Constantinople retained some ancient ways, while the West saw cities fall into disrepair.|"1. What made the Goths embrace Christianity under Bishop Ulfilas?

During the Middle Ages, few people traveled between Constantinople and Italy or France, and those from western Europe rarely visited Constantinople. Most men in Italy, France, and England couldn't read Greek and had stopped reading the works of ancient Romans. In 597 A.D., Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, becoming the religion of tribes that established their kingdoms. The Angles and Saxons, who invaded Britain, were pagan worshippers until Gregory, a Roman monk, saw three fair-haired Angle boys in Rome and decided to convert them. This led to the arrival of missionaries in Angle-land. The conversion of the English aided in spreading Christianity, especially to the Germans, through missionaries like Boniface. Educated individuals in the Middle Ages, particularly church priests, used Latin and preserved Roman and Greek knowledge. The Vikings, also known as Northmen or Normans, were fierce sea-rovers who plundered and conquered lands across western Europe.|"1.

The Danes were fierce raiders who attacked the eastern and southern coasts of England, pillaging until there was little left. Eventually, they settled in the land, leading to conflicts with English kings like Alfred. In 878 A.D., Alfred defeated a Danish army and converted one of their kings to Christianity. The Danes were allowed to keep the eastern part of England, known as Danelaw. Later, the Danes moved to France, where they were given Normandy by a Frankish king. The Normans embraced Christianity and became skilled sailors, exploring far-off lands like Iceland and Greenland. Leif Ericson, son of Eric the Red, even reached North America, where they established temporary settlements.

In medieval times, disputes were settled through wager of battle, where two men fought with hammers or small battle-axes, and the loser conceded. King Henry introduced a fairer method, trial by jury. Twelve men were chosen to hear the facts, discuss, and then decide who was right. These men, known as jurors, were crucial in finding the truth. Richard the Lionhearted, King Henry's son, was a fearless warrior who tried to recapture Jerusalem. His brother John, who became king after Richard, was cowardly and wicked. Tired of John's misdeeds, the nobles and clergy forced him to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede. This document ensured fair treatment, the right to a trial by jury, and limited the king's power to levy taxes without consent. The Magna Carta was a significant step towards self-government.|"1.

In medieval times, disputes were settled through wager of battle, where two men fought with hammers or small battle-axes, and the loser conceded. King Henry introduced a fairer method, trial by jury. Twelve men were chosen to hear the facts, discuss, and then decide who was right. These men, known as jurors, were crucial in finding the truth. Richard the Lionhearted, King Henry's son, was a fearless warrior who tried to recapture Jerusalem. His brother John, who became king after Richard, was cowardly and wicked. Tired of John's misdeeds, the nobles and clergy forced him to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede.

The English parliament was a significant development in self-governance. When King John broke his promises, the English reminded him of the Great Charter. Simon de Montfort led a meeting with town representatives to discuss the king's actions, setting a precedent for seeking advice from various groups. Over time, this evolved into Parliament, comprising the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Representatives were chosen to attend, ensuring efficient decision-making. This system contrasted with the Romans, who required citizens to be present in Rome for elections. The Channel protected the English from external threats, allowing them to challenge their king without fear of invasion. Unlike France, England was more united, fostering a culture of self-governance and learning from other European nations.|"1.

During the Middle Ages, different kinds of type were developed by printers. German printers used Gothic type, imitating quill lettering, which is still used in German books. Italian printers created Roman type, more rounded and simple, resembling Italian handwriting and widely used in Europe, England, and America. They also introduced italic type. The Aldine Press, run by Venetian Aldus Manutius, printed Greek manuscripts in beautiful type. William Caxton, an English printer, printed Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Gutenberg's first printed book was the Bible in Latin. In architecture and sculpture, artists imitated Greek and Roman styles, using round arches and domes. Sculptors depicted stories of gods and heroes, inspired by ancient statues. This revival of ancient art and knowledge in the Renaissance period led to a reawakening of minds across Europe.|"1.

During the Middle Ages, merchants faced perilous journeys due to the threat of robbers on land and sea. Robbers, including the Northmen and local sailors, targeted traders for their goods. However, as trade expanded, kings and lords provided protection on land, and merchants armed their ships against pirates at sea. This led to a decrease in robberies and piracy, allowing merchant ships to increase in number and undertake long voyages. Trade initially thrived at large fairs where merchants from England and Europe exchanged goods like spices, silks, and wool. Luxuries like spices, cotton, and dyes were sourced from the East, including Persia, India, and China. Venetian traders played a significant role in trading these Eastern goods, sailing fleets to Bruges and London to exchange products from the North for spices, drugs, and silks.|"1.

With a small crew of 18 men on a ship similar in size to Columbus's _Niña_, Cabot sailed around Ireland and reached the coast of North America between Labrador and Nova Scotia. He found signs of human habitation but no people. Cabot's voyages, including a likely second one with his son Sebastian, were soon forgotten in England. Interestingly, the Americas were named after Americus Vespucius, an Italian who wrote about the New World, claiming it was more populous and pleasant than any other region. His writings spread widely due to the printing press, leading many to consider him the true discoverer of America.|"1. What was John Cabot's main goal during his voyage in 1497?

Columbus believed he had found a new route to the Indies and thought the islands he encountered on the way were less significant. When he reached what we now know as South America, he didn't realize it was a new continent.

In the 16th century, emigrating from Spain to settle in Spanish America was a challenging task. Firstly, one needed the king's permission, proving a strong Catholic background free of heresy for three generations. Even the emigrant's wife had to consent, debts cleared, and foreigners were unwelcome. The sea voyage was perilous and expensive, lasting weeks or even months. Despite the hardships, the need for laborers in the colonies was high. While emigration was slow, many laborers went to the gold and silver mines due to the allure of wealth. Landowners resorted to Indian slavery as there were not enough white laborers. Europeans believed non-Christians could be enslaved, and the Spanish forced Indians to work their farms and mines.|"1.

Slavery was devastating for the West Indians, especially the native Indians who were unaccustomed to such hard labor. Overseers were harsh, leading to the rapid decline of the natives due to the brutal conditions and diseases brought by the white men. When the Indian population dwindled, slave-hunters turned to Africa for slaves. Bartholomew de Las Casas, the son of a companion of Columbus, became a priest and staunch advocate against Indian slavery. He successfully convinced King Charles V to abolish Indian slavery in 1542, but by then, the native population had drastically decreased. Las Casas, who initially supported replacing Indian slaves with African slaves, later regretted this decision as African slavery grew rapidly in the West Indies after Indian slavery was banned. Las Casas' efforts saved mainland Indians from a similar fate.|"1. What was the main reason for the decline of the native Indian population in the West Indies?

The purpose of the mainland missions was to bring peace and Christianity to the native tribes. Las Casas, a missionary, demonstrated that kindness and education could achieve more than warfare. He and his fellow monks lived among the Indians, teaching them Christian values and helping them abandon their violent ways. The missions, or villages, established by the priests became centers of learning and industry. The Indians learned new skills, cultivated the land, and supported the church with their produce. The monks cared for the community, taught in schools, and maintained order. Over time, Spanish settlers joined the missions, creating a mixed society that adopted Spanish customs and religion.

Ponce de Leon, a Spanish explorer, ventured into the unknown lands north of the Gulf of Mexico in search of a legendary fountain of youth. Despite not finding the fountain, he discovered a land abundant with flowers during the Easter season of 1513. Naming it Florida, he landed near present-day St. Augustine but tragically lost his life in a battle with the native Indians. Following his exploration, other Spanish adventurers scoured the Gulf and Atlantic coasts seeking a passage to India. De Soto, another renowned explorer, led an expedition through the southern United States, driven by tales of a land rich in gold ruled by a gilded king. With over six hundred men of noble descent, De Soto's journey through the south of North America began in 1539, uncovering new territories and encountering indigenous peoples along the way.|"1.

"In the spring, De Soto resumed his explorations, akin to an adventure deep into the heart of Africa. The expedition journeyed northeast through what is now Georgia and South Carolina, possibly reaching the North Carolina border. Passing through mountains, they headed southwest through Tennessee and Alabama until they reached a sizable Indian village called Mauvilla near the head of Mobile Bay. Mobile was named after this Indian village. The Alabama Indians, known as ""the thicket clearers,"" were close by. De Soto then altered his path northwest into the uncharted interior, facing numerous hardships along the way. His army faced exhaustion, cutting roads through thickets, creating paths through swamps, and fording rivers. They often had to halt for months to rest their horses and scavenge for food.

"In 1588, the Spanish king aimed to conquer England through the ""Invincible Armada,"" a mighty fleet. However, Sir Francis Drake's attack on Cadiz delayed the Armada's voyage. When the Armada reached the English Channel, the Spanish ships, though larger, were slow, allowing the English to outmaneuver and attack them effectively. The English ships, equipped with heavy cannons, dealt a severe blow to the Armada. In the narrow waters near Dover and Calais, the English intensified their assault, sinking Spanish vessels. A fierce storm then forced the remaining Armada ships to flee towards the North Sea, with many meeting a tragic end on the rocky coasts. Only a fraction of the proud Spanish fleet returned home. This defeat marked the end of Spain's attempts to conquer England, as the country had depleted its resources for the failed Armada. Additionally, the Dutch seized the opportunity to gain independence from Spanish rule, establishing themselves as the United Netherlands and expanding their trade ventures to the East, challenging Portuguese dominance in the Spice Islands and venturing into the Americas."|"1.

English sailors like Drake despised the Spaniards, and Drake's method of living involved seizing Spanish ships. The English were victorious against the Spanish Armada due to various factors.

The English were preoccupied with the power struggle between their monarchs and the popes over control of the English Church. This changed during Queen Elizabeth's reign. Sea-captains, inspired by Drake's success, set sail for the Americas. Many targeted the West Indies for plunder from Spanish ships. Some explored North America to find regions untouched by the Spanish. Martin Frobisher sought the Northwest Passage, while Drake attempted a western route in 1579. Humphrey Gilbert had a grand plan to establish settlements in the New World, supported by Queen Elizabeth. English sailors like Drake despised the Spaniards, and Drake's method of living involved seizing Spanish ships. The English were victorious against the Spanish Armada due to various factors. King Philip II of Spain attempted to conquer England to assert his control, leading to the famous battle fought against the Armada. English interest in America was piqued by these events, leading to further exploration and colonization efforts.|"3.
