Ethel Blue excitedly suggested planting lovely shrubs once the workmen were done, drawing on her experience with her aunt ordering bushes. Roger, however, questioned if they had gardening tools, bringing their plans down to earth. He proposed using a piano box as a toolhouse, covering it with tar paper.

They discussed the various uses of different gourds, like making dippers or nest eggs. As they enjoyed hot chocolate and sandwiches, Mrs. Smith sang a song about the four seasons. Ethel Blue found the stanza mentioning winter fitting after their garden discussions. Despite their focus on gardens, they pondered how to serve others through their club activities, considering projects like helping poor women and children find respite at the old Emerson farmhouse.|"1.

In April, the young horticulturists at the Mortons' and Smiths' gardens planted various seeds like cosmos, four o'clocks, marigolds, petunias, and ageratums. They followed the seed catalog instructions and read pamphlets from the Department of Agriculture.

"In botany, a leaf consists of a petiole, stipules, and a blade. The petiole is a small stalk that connects the leaf to the stem. At the base of the petiole, there are two tiny leaflets called stipules. The main part of the leaf that we often refer to as ""the leaf"" is actually the blade. Veins in leaves can be classified as net-veined or parallel-veined. Net-veined leaves have veins that form a network, while parallel-veined leaves have veins that run straight from the stem to the tip. Leaves can also vary in shape, such as lance-shaped, oblong, elliptical, oval, ovate, heart-shaped, kidney-shaped, ear-shaped, arrow-shaped, and halberd-shaped. Additionally, leaf tips can be described as pointed, acute, obtuse, truncate, notched, and more. Leaflets are smaller sections of a compound leaf, while a leaf is the entire structure attached to a stem."|"1. What is the function of the petiole in a leaf?
A) To carry out photosynthesis

Helen and her cousin discussed the different types of leaf shapes they had learned about that afternoon. They talked about '_pinnately compound_' and '_palmately compound_' leaves, depending on how the leaflets were arranged. They also spoke about the various edges of leaves like '_serrate_,' '_dentate_,' '_crenate_,' '_wavy_,' '_cut_,' '_cleft_,' '_lobed_,' and '_parted_.' Roger then joined the conversation and shared his observation about the lack of space for plants near the mill shanties. He suggested a community project to clear the area and create a garden. The plan involved getting contributions for fertilizers, using street sweepings and horse manure, and involving children in gardening as part of their nature study. The project aimed to benefit both individuals and the community.|"1. What did Helen and her cousin discuss about that afternoon?

Dorothy's story about different plants interested Ethel Blue, but Mary seemed uninterested. Unsure whether to be hurt, Dorothy glanced at her mother, who subtly indicated to let it go. As they strolled through the Botanical Gardens and Museum, the afternoon lost its spark. On the train to Rosemont, Mary sat with Mrs. Smith, who encouraged her to share fascinating stories someday. Meanwhile, Mr. Emerson's group traveled across Pennsylvania, admiring the state's beauty tarnished by mining waste. They discussed the French and Indian Wars fought in the region, where young Washington's efforts to build a fort were thwarted by the French, leading to the establishment of Fort Duquesne.|"5.

When the British were very close to Fort Duquesne, the French sent a small group, mostly Indians, to meet them. The English general didn't grasp Indian warfare and kept his soldiers grouped in the road, where they were shot down in large numbers, resulting in the loss of his own life. A town is named after him at the battle site. Washington assumed command after Braddock's death, marking his first true military experience. His focus was on capturing Fort Duquesne, and when General Forbes was sent out for another attempt, Washington led one of the Virginia regiments. The group traveled to Pittsburg, where they visited the city's landmarks and learned about its history. Pittsburg has a city organist who plays the great organ in the auditorium every Sunday, attracting thousands of people. The city's steel mills produce dense black smoke, adding to the industrial atmosphere. The group explored the town before heading to the train station, excited about the upcoming discoveries related to a mysterious man named Hapgood.|"1.

The Superintendent explained that the mine kept the largest lump of coal ever found because it's easier to handle in smaller pieces. He warned about dangers like suffocation from lack of air or explosions caused by 'fire damp' gas. This gas forms from decaying ferns and plants from the carboniferous age. The coal was created by the decay of huge trees and ferns, compressed over time to form a mineral. The group descended into the mine with oil lamps, passing through narrow passages to see the miners at work. The Superintendent showed them the fire-damp gas above, a potential danger. Despite the risks, the miners worked calmly. The visitors felt uneasy but followed the Superintendent to a gas-free area to witness something remarkable.|"1.
