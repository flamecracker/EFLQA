Chester, after sneaking a hundred yards, hid in another hole and waited. The Germans who had been nearby approached the burning wreckage of the biplane. They seemed satisfied and didn't raise an alarm. Shells from distant trench guns exploded around them, causing them to scatter. Chester cautiously moved towards the front lines. As he advanced, the shells stopped bursting in his direction. He felt the support of Captain O'Neill and his superiors who had planned this risky mission. Until five minutes to 10 o'clock, Captain O'Neill had assured him of safety. The French artillery cleared a path for him while protecting him. Chester navigated through the darkness, dodging shells but remaining unharmed. The shells acted as a shield, allowing him to move freely behind enemy lines. Troops were present but hidden, unaware of anyone daring to advance openly. Chester consulted a map and a timetable, guiding his path towards safety until 10 o'clock when he would need to fend for himself.|"6. How did Chester navigate through the darkness behind enemy lines?
