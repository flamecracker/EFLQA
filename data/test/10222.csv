The Puritans were unhappy with the Church in England during James the First's reign. They sought his support but were let down. The conference at Hampton Court showed his lack of sympathy, and the subsequent convocation dashed their hopes. Many dissenters formed a 'Church Estate' to follow God's ways, rejecting the English church government for that of Geneva and the Netherlands.

The Puritans, influenced by Robinson, sought refuge in America. They sought King James' protection but only received vague promises. They negotiated with the Virginian Company for land.

The children of the wilderness have a unique way of finding direction without a compass. By examining the wood grain of trees, they can determine north from south. The Wampanoge Chief used this method when he was lost without the sun's guidance. He would strike a tree with his axe, notch it, and then observe the rings to determine the direction. This knowledge was crucial for survival in the vast forests they called home. When the Chief and his companions traveled to New Plymouth, they carried nokake, a meal made of parched maize, in their leather belts. This simple food required water or snow to be eaten due to its dryness. The Chief warned the settlers of a native conspiracy, urging them to prepare for an attack.
