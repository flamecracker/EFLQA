Before starting their journey, Cadmus helped Thasus construct a shelter while Telephassa, being too weak to offer much help, guided them on how to set it up comfortably. Thasus, however, didn't spend all his time in the bower. Other homeless people also found the spot appealing and built homes nearby. In a few years, a thriving city emerged with Thasus as its king, chosen for his upright and courageous nature. But once he settled the kingdom's affairs, Thasus handed over his royal attire and duties to another and resumed his quest for the snow-white bull and the lost child. Despite Europa never returning, Thasus kept provisions ready in case she did. Telephassa and Cadmus continued their journey alone, with the queen growing weaker by the day but determined to find her lost child. Eventually, she told Cadmus that her rest would be eternal, urging him to bury her there. After tearful goodbyes, Telephassa passed away, leaving Cadmus with instructions to seek guidance from the oracle at Delphi.|"4. What was Thasus's attitude towards Europa never returning?

I will not make you sad, my young listeners, by telling you how Telephassa passed away and was laid to rest.
