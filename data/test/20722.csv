Elizabeth observed the child closely, sticking to her belief that kids should sleep early, not linger on laps. A struggle ensued when she tried to wake them. She stood firm, hoping for a peaceful outcome, relieved that Chilian was present. Elizabeth didn't approve of children leaving quietly; she preferred them to resist. Chilian, hoping for no drama, lifted his book. The child, raised with strict Puritan values, bid good night sleepily, linking arms with Rachel. Elizabeth disapproved of children staying up late, neglecting prayers. She straightened the room as Eunice rolled up her work. The child begged to sleep together due to fear of the big, lonely bed. Elizabeth would have disapproved of the child seeking comfort. The storm raged outside, shaking trees and lashing the ocean. Silas worked in the barn, while Elizabeth and Eunice tended to household tasks. Eunice showed the child her colorful patchwork blocks.|"1. What did Elizabeth believe about kids and sleep?

During the early days in New England, no one foresaw the bustling mills that would soon produce cotton cloths and calicoes. These fabrics were once imported and expensive.

"""Oh no,"" she said with a slight smile. In the old days, boys were under their fathers' authority until they turned twenty-one.

Cousin Giles visited and spent two days in the warehouse, where they had not taken her. She helped Cousin Eunice cut stems of garden herbs for drying and perfumery. Lavender, sweet marjoram, and sweet clover scented the house. Cynthia preferred these scents to sandalwood and Oriental perfumes. Autumn storms arrived, anchoring vessels securely at the docks.

Cousin Giles, a strong man with white hair and penetrating eyes, made little progress with her. Chilian Leverett, cautious of the girl, hoped the fortune had been left differently. The East India Marine Society, filled with curiosities, had a wider mission. Matters settled amicably in the Leverett house, with Rachel earning Elizabeth's respect and proving herself helpful during illnesses.|"1.

Cousin Chilian brought news from Mother, bringing joy to her. Despite the challenges, I had wonderful times. Cousin Chilian and Cousin Eunice cared deeply for me. Cousin Elizabeth would have too if she had lived longer. I engaged in various activities like studying, traveling, making friends, and painting.
