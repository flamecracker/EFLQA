Dear Mother, I have safely arrived here. My dress wasn't too wrinkled, and Aunt Jane helped me smooth it out. I really like Mr. Cobb; he chews but tosses newspapers right up to the doors. I sat outside for a bit on the ride over but moved inside before reaching Aunt Miranda's house. I didn't want to, but I thought you'd prefer it that way. Miranda is such a long name, so I might just say Aunt M. and Aunt J. in my Sunday letters. Aunt J. gave me a dictionary to look up all the tough words. It takes a lot of time, and I'm glad people can talk without having to spell. Talking is much easier than writing and a lot more enjoyable. The brick house looks exactly as you described. The parlor is impressive and gives you shivers when you peek inside. The furniture is elegant too, but aside from the kitchen, there aren't many comfy places to sit. The same old cat is here, but they don't keep the kittens when she has them. She's too old to play with. Hannah once told me you ran away with father, and I can see why that would be nice.

"Dear Mother,

I am feeling very unhappy this morning. I heard a story from Cora, The Doctor's Wife, about her mother-in-law being unkind, similar to Aunt M.'s behavior towards me. I wish Hannah had come instead of me, as she is better behaved and doesn't argue as quickly. Aunt J. needs some pieces of my buff calico to fix a button on my dress. The styles in Riverboro are lovely, much better than in Temperance. School is going well. The teacher can answer more questions than the one in Temperance, but not as many as I can ask. I am smarter than all the girls except for one, but not as clever as two boys. Emma Jane is very good at math and spelling but lacks imagination. I am in the Sixth Reader, but Miss Dearborn might move me to a lower class because I struggle with the seven multiplication table. I am trying for the spelling prize but worry about making mistakes in poetry. Last Sunday, I learned the correct spelling of ""seraphim"" and realized my mistake. Miss Dearborn advises using words I can spell correctly. I sew dresses in the afternoons while the others play. I am happy that our cow had a spotted calf. It will be a good year for apples and hay, which will help pay off the mortgage. Miss Dearborn asked us about the purpose of education, and I answered that mine is to help with the mortgage. She punished me by assigning"|"1. What is the main reason for the author feeling unhappy in the morning?

Jane worried that Rebecca was different from the others and hard to handle.

Rebecca was a kind-hearted girl who often helped out in her village. She would run to the shed to get food for the vendors, knew the stories of traveling salesmen, and even stayed over with kids from neighboring towns. However, despite having many friends, she always felt a bit lonely. Her friendships were varied, but none seemed to satisfy her deep longing for a true connection. She loved her friend Emma Jane for her kindness and loyalty, but their bond lacked a deeper understanding.

"Every drop of blood in Rebecca's body seemed to stand still, and her heart almost stopped beating. Mrs. Cobb's excited breathing could be heard distinctly in the silence. There was nothing extraordinary in Mr. Burch's request. In his travels among rural church communities, he often met young members who had ""experienced religion"" and joined the church at a young age. Rebecca, at thirteen, had already taken on responsibilities within the church. When Mr. Burch assumed she was a devout member, she faced a dilemma. How could she refuse? How could she explain she wasn't a member? How could she pray before all those elderly women? Rebecca felt overwhelmed as she stood up to pray, her mind filled with images and phrases from Mr. Burch's teachings. Despite her internal struggle, she began to pray slowly and hesitantly, blending hymns and her own thoughts. Rebecca's heartfelt words, while a mix of hymns and sermon imagery, carried a unique sincerity that resonated with those around her."|"1. What caused Rebecca's heart to almost stop beating?
