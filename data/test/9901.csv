Quietly, a small group started to gather. Nora, as the chief bridesmaid, followed the flower girls. She was dressed in a white satin wedding gown and carried a large bunch of white roses. Then came the bride. Grace had predicted that Jessica would never look more beautiful than in her white satin wedding dress. Her veil, made of exquisite yellow-white lace passed down through generations, was a family heirloom. Jessica's bouquet was a cascade of lilies of the valley. Her fair skin looked even more radiant, and her blue eyes sparkled with joy. The bridesmaids wore white chiffon over pale green chiffon, creating a misty sea-foam effect. Delicate green satin belts and hair accessories made of chiffon flowers and satin leaves completed their outfits. They held bouquets of white sweet peas. The bridal party descended the stairs to Mendelssohn's wedding march, played by the orchestra in a corner of the hall. The orchestra, known for playing during the Eight Originals' high school days, added a nostalgic touch. Jessica had joked that it would feel wrong to get married without their music. At the bottom of the stairs, Jessica's father awaited her. The party proceeded slowly to the parlor, transformed into a green fairyland. Before a backdrop of ferns, white roses, and sweet peas, the clergyman who had married Jessica's mother stood ready to officiate. Reddy, accompanied by his best man, awaited his bride. As|"3.
