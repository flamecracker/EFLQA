Insects and horses may both be animals, but their eating habits are vastly different. Insects have jaws that move horizontally to tear food, unlike horses that move their jaws up and down. Insects have complex mouthparts, including true jaws, accessory jaws, and feelers that help them detect food by touch and smell. The jaws of insects are toothed and variously shaped to tear and crush food. Insects consume large quantities of food when young, like the American Silk-worm, which can eat food equal to eighty-six thousand times its weight in just fifty-six days. Insects have a simple stomach and some, like grasshoppers, have a gizzard to crush food finely. Insects walk using their strong muscles, with some insects having over a thousand muscles for locomotion. Insects like flies can walk upside down due to their specialized foot structure with holding hairs that help them stick to surfaces, aided by atmospheric pressure.|"1.

In the world of insects, the journey from larva to butterfly is a fascinating transformation. The caterpillar, known as the larva, starts its life as a voracious eater, only to later find a quiet spot to transform into a chrysalis. The chrysalis, adorned with golden and silvery spots, hangs suspended until the butterfly emerges. The butterfly, with wet wings, dries and expands them before taking flight. This process showcases the beauty and wonder of nature.

The Honey bee, a marvel in itself, has captivated observers for centuries. The intricate life of the bees, from the queen laying eggs to the construction of hexagonal cells, is a subject of deep study. The division of bees into social and solitary species adds another layer of complexity to their fascinating world. The life of the Honey bee, with its queen, workers, and drones, is a well-orchestrated symphony of nature. Even in the tropics, where different species like Meliponas and Trigonas thrive, the art of bee-keeping continues to amaze with its diversity and ingenuity."|"1.

In a nest of the coal-black Trigona from eastern Australia, Mr. F. Smith found hundreds of dead workers but no females. The combs were like those of common wasps, with 250 honey-pots at the nest's base. Mr. Smith suggests that Trigona hives have multiple fertile females to explain the large number of workers. Similarly, M. Guérin discovered six females in a Tawny-footed Melipona nest. The economy of the Humble bee begins in early spring when the queen awakens and selects a nesting place. She lays eggs in a pollen mass, gradually adding more eggs as food is collected. Larvae eat the pollen, creating cavities, then spin silken walls and develop into pupae. Workers, small females, males, and queens emerge. The nest grows as the queen remains prolific, producing more workers until late summer when large females and males are born, with queens being impregnated before winter.

In a nest of the coal-black Trigona from eastern Australia, Mr. F. Smith found hundreds of dead workers but no females. The combs were like those of common wasps, with 250 honey-pots at the nest's base. Mr. Smith suggests that Trigona hives have multiple fertile females to explain the large number of workers. Similarly, M. Guérin discovered six females in a Tawny-footed Melipona nest. The economy of the Humble bee begins in early spring when the queen awakens and selects a nesting place. She lays eggs in a pollen mass, gradually adding more eggs as food is collected. Larvae eat the pollen, creating cavities, then spin silken walls and develop into pupae. Workers, small females, males, and queens emerge. The nest grows as the queen remains prolific, producing more workers until late summer when large females and males are born, with queens being impregnated before winter.

The bee's burrow is divided into small cells, each about seven-tenths of an inch long. The partitions inside are made of the dust and chips the bee creates while digging. This hardworking bee has strong jaws and brushes on her legs to clean out the tunnel. She uses her hind legs to carry the wood chips out of the cell. The partitions are made of layers of chips rolled into a coil. The bee smoothes the bottom of the cell and leaves the top rough. The larvae inside feed on pollen, and the cells are beautifully built with delicate silk walls. The bee, called Ceratina, tunnels into shrub stems to create her cells, making them just wide enough for her body. Each cell is about four and a half tenths of an inch long and a bit over one-third as broad. The life cycle of this bee involves laying eggs in pollen-filled cells, going through egg, larva, and chrysalis stages, and finally emerging as an adult bee.|"1.

"The young of bees face dangers even in their supposed safe havens. Ichneumon flies, including the Anthophorabia species, lay eggs inside bee larvae, emerging as parasites. The Leaf-cutter bee, also known as Megachile, is a robust insect with unique habits. They lay eggs in burrows in elder stems and locust tree hollows. The female Leaf-cutter bee meticulously constructs cells using leaf pieces she cuts with her scissors-like jaws. Each cell is then stocked with pollen and an egg. The larva spins a cocoon inside the cell, emerging as a bee later. Mason bees, like the Osmia species, have diverse nesting habits, choosing plant stems, rotten posts, or snail shells. Curtis discovered a British Osmia species that lived for three years before maturity, with three successive broods. This phenomenon contributes to ""insect years,"" where bees and wasps thrive in abundance."|"1. What is a danger that young bees face according to the text?

In 1864, Mr. G. R. Waterhouse observed the fascinating behavior of Osmia leucomelana bees. These bees construct their cells from mud, forming each cell separately. The female bee starts by depositing a small mud pellet in a sheltered spot and then begins to excavate a cavity in its upper surface using her jaws. The result is a rough outer surface and a smooth inner surface mud-cup. The lid of the cell is concave on the outer surface and convex on the inner. The largest species, O. lignivora, tunnels elaborate burrows inside maple trees. The bee intelligently constructs cells, each half an inch long and somewhat jug-shaped. The material is silken and parchment-like. The bees emerge from the cells in March after living on honey and water. The bees exhibit impressive instincts and limited reasoning abilities, showcasing their role in nature's plan.|"1. What is the main material used by Osmia leucomelana bees to construct their cells?

Mr. Angus shared observations about the Wandering Humble bee, noting the males near a garden fence. He described them fanning at a hole, creating a buzzing sound. The males were active, some resting while others flew around. The workers appeared similar in size to the males. The fanning activity seemed aimed at introducing air into the nest, akin to Honey bees. Additionally, a description of Xylocopa bee behavior was provided, detailing the dimensions of a tunnel and the presence of larvae and pollen in cells. The Xylocopa bee was observed bobbing at the hole, potentially interacting with others inside. The passage also discussed Andrena and Halictus bees, highlighting their burrowing habits and lack of social organization compared to Hive and Humble bees. These bees exhibit industrious digging behavior in spring to create nests underground.|"1. What did Mr. Angus observe about the Wandering Humble bee near a garden fence?

Mr. Angus shared observations about the Wandering Humble bee, noting the males near a garden fence. He described them fanning at a hole, creating a buzzing sound. The males were active, some resting while others flew around. The workers appeared similar in size to the males. The fanning activity seemed aimed at introducing air into the nest, akin to Honey bees. Additionally, a description of Xylocopa bee behavior was provided, detailing the dimensions of a tunnel and the presence of larvae and pollen in cells. The Xylocopa bee was observed bobbing at the hole, potentially interacting with others inside. The passage also discussed Andrena and Halictus bees, highlighting their burrowing habits and lack of social organization compared to Hive and Humble bees. These bees exhibit industrious digging behavior in spring to create nests underground.|"4. What did the description of the Xylocopa bee behavior mention about the cells inside the tunnel?

The natural size nest of Andrena vicina is a fascinating sight, with the main burrow and cells leading from it clearly visible. The oldest cell containing the pupa is closest to the surface, while the cells with the larva lie in between the pupa and the cell containing the pollen mass and egg. The most recent cell is the deepest and holds a freshly deposited pollen mass. The bees were observed digging their holes in early May, with mounds of earth hardly noticeable. By mid-May, hundreds of Andrena holes were found in the pasture. The bees gather pollen, kneading it into pellet-like masses to feed their larvae. The bees return to their cells laden with pollen, elaborating it into bee bread within. On a rainy day, the bees seek shelter in their holes. By late July, the larvae transform into pupae, with some cells also housing pupae of Cuckoo bees. In August, fully formed bees and pupae were found in unearthed burrows.|"1.

On the final day of August, only a few holes were open. Some Oil beetles and small black Ichneumon flies were wandering near the holes. The burrow goes straight down, with short paths leading to cells that are slightly slanted downwards and outwards from the main tunnel. The gallery walls are rough, but the cells are lined with a sticky substance that hardens, resembling glazed pottery. The size of the cell is like an acorn, with a thin layer of dirt sticking to it. The larva of Andrena is soft, with a flattened body bulging at the sides and tapering towards each end. The skin is thin, showing the pulsating heart along the back. The pupa, or chrysalis, lies in a compact position in its cell. The stages between larva and pupa are gradual, involving changes in tissues. The pupa state lasts around three to four weeks, with the larva transforming into bees by the end of August.|"1. What is the main purpose of the cells in the burrow described in the text?

On July 16th, a search was conducted revealing over twenty cells dug out in the ground. The upper cells contained nearly mature pupae, while the lower ones housed larvae of varying sizes. The smallest larvae were barely visible to the naked eye and were found in individual cells on lumps of pollen, diminishing in size as the larvae grew. These young bees were likely offspring from multiple females, as four mature bees were discovered in the hole. The larva of an English species hatches ten days after the eggs are laid. Another brood of bees emerged in mid-September, found in holes of the same species on a hard gravel road. Parasitic bees were also observed in nests of Andrena and Halictus, living off their hosts. This parasitism does not usually lead to the death of the host bee.|"1. What did the search on July 16th reveal in the ground?

The study of animal parasites has recently attracted much interest among scientists. Bees, both domestic and wild, provide fascinating examples of the unique relationship between hosts and parasites living on them. Insects have various ways of parasitizing other insects. Some species consume the contents of the victim's egg, while others attack the insect during different stages of its life cycle - as a larva, pupa, or adult. For instance, the Ichneumon flies and Tachina species are common insect parasites that live inside their hosts, consuming their fatty tissues. The Phora fly is a small insect that lays its eggs on bee larvae, leading to the death of the host bee due to the parasite's consumption of its fatty tissues. This parasitic relationship can cause diseases like foul-brood in beehives.|"1. What has recently attracted much interest among scientists?

Fabre, a renowned entomologist, detailed the intriguing life cycle of the Sitaris beetle, a European insect similar to the Meloë. The female Sitaris lays its eggs near bee nests, waiting for the perfect moment when a bee lays its egg. At that instant, the Sitaris larva drops from the bee's body, feasting on the freshly laid bee egg. After this meal, it consumes the bee's honey and transforms into a footless grub. Once fully fed, it enters a pupa state, encasing itself in a hard skin. Within this skin, a whitish larva develops into the true pupa. Eventually, the pupa emerges as a beetle, belonging to the same group as the Meloë beetle. Similarly, the Stylops beetle, related to Meloë, has a peculiar life cycle where the female lives inside a bee, giving birth to numerous offspring. These parasites exhaust their hosts, leading to premature death. Additionally, bees can also suffer from parasitic worms like the Gordius, which infest their bodies, causing disease.|"1.

Flies, like mosquitoes, undergo growth in their larva and pupa stages. Once they develop wings, they do not grow any further. Small midges are not young mosquitoes but adult forms of different fly species. The larva of the Ocean gnat, living along the New England coast, transforms into a mosquito-like fly. Similarly, other gnats have been found in Northern lakes. The Black fly, a significant pest, hinders travel in subarctic regions. It swarms in immense numbers during warm days, making outdoor activities challenging. Unlike mosquitoes, Black flies disappear in cloudy weather. Their bites can be severe, leaving behind blood clots. The Buffalo Gnat, known for biting horses, and the Simulium molestum, or Black fly, are part of this group of troublesome insects.|"1.

"Countless long, thin, white worms are often discovered dwelling in the soil, with sour sap leaking from wounds in the elm tree. A couple of summers back, we stumbled upon some of these larvae, and upon raising them, we identified them as a type of Mycetobia. The larvae have their abdominal segments split into two parts, with the rear portion smaller than the front. They measure just over a third of an inch in length. Pupae were spotted protruding from the tree, anchored by tiny spines at the tail. The larvae infested the tree for six weeks before flies emerged, resembling gnats and about a line long. These larvae, which can be harmful to horses, are beneficial in their larval stage, feeding on animal and decaying matter. Horse flies, like the ""Green head"" species, are known for their painful bites, causing distress to horses and cattle. These flies are prevalent in marshes and prairies during summer, with various species found in North America. The mouthparts of the Horse fly are adapted for piercing flesh, similar to mosquitoes, and only the females bite. The Timb or Tsetze fly, part of this fly group, is known to plague and poison cattle in certain African regions. Lastly, the carpet fly, Scenopinus pallipes, in its larval form, is found under carpets and rotten wood, but is not typically destructive in homes."|"1.

In Central and South America, there are documented cases of a bot fly species that can live in the human body, causing painful lumps under the skin on the arms, legs, and abdomen. It is debated whether this human bot fly is a true parasite or an accidental one, with the prevailing belief being that its usual host is monkeys or dogs. In different regions, this repulsive larva is known as Ver macaque in Cayenne, Ura in Para, Torcel in Costa Rica, and Gusano peludo or Nuche in New Granada. The bot fly of horses, Gastrophilus equi, lays eggs on the horse's knees, which are then ingested and develop into larvae in the stomach. The larvae mature until October, then attach themselves to the horse's rectum until they are excreted. Hypoderma bovis is the bot fly of cattle, living in back tumors during May and the summer, emerging as flies from May to September. The larva of the sheep bot fly, Oestrus ovis, lives in the sheep's frontal sinus and nasal cavity, falling to the ground when mature, pupating quickly, and emerging as flies in the summer.

In Central and South America, there are documented cases of a bot fly species that can live in the human body, causing painful lumps under the skin on the arms, legs, and abdomen. It is debated whether this human bot fly is a true parasite or an accidental one, with the prevailing belief being that its usual host is monkeys or dogs. In different regions, this repulsive larva is known as Ver macaque in Cayenne, Ura in Para, Torcel in Costa Rica, and Gusano peludo or Nuche in New Granada. The bot fly of horses, Gastrophilus equi, lays eggs on the horse's knees, which are then ingested and develop into larvae in the stomach. The larvae mature until October, then attach themselves to the horse's rectum until they are excreted. Hypoderma bovis is the bot fly of cattle, living in back tumors during May and the summer, emerging as flies from May to September.

Dr. G. A. Perkins from Salem has successfully raised numerous flea larvae from eggs. When hatched, the larvae are about half a line long, with a long white body having thirteen segments. They feed on blood clots and live in unswept areas like floors of out-houses or animal bedding. It takes about six days for the larvae to appear after the eggs are laid, and they mature in a few days, spin cocoons, change to pupae, and become adult fleas in around ten days. A practical tip to get rid of fleas on dogs includes cleaning their kennels frequently and using chips as bedding. Infested dogs can be washed every few days with strong soapsuds or weak tobacco or petroleum water. The Persian Insect Destroyer is recommended for dogs, and cleanliness and wearing shoes are suggested to prevent infestation by the Sarcopsylla penetrans, also known as the Jigger or Chigoe.|"1.

The study of lice, despite its seemingly unglamorous nature, is crucial for understanding insect classification and morphology. By examining parasitic species like lice, we gain insights into the embryology and post-egg changes of various insects.

Under a strong microscope, specimens treated with weakened potash reveal that the mandibles and maxillæ originate close to each other in the center of the head, across from the eyes, with their bases slightly moving apart. From there, they converge towards the mouth, where they meet and then extend freely, forming thin chitinous bands that come together like the maxillæ or tongue of butterflies, creating a hollow tube for sucking. The mandibles each culminate in a curved, slender filament, potentially used as a tactile organ to locate the best spots in the victim's flesh for blood extraction. On the contrary, the maxillæ, narrower than the mandibles, taper towards the end, bristle-like, and are tipped with numerous extremely fine barbs that anchor the bug in the flesh while blood is drawn through the mandibles.

During the summer months of July and August, Dragonflies, specifically the species Libellula, are most abundant. These dragonflies lay their eggs by attaching them in loose clusters to the stems of plants that grow in water. The process of laying eggs involves the female dragonfly alighting on water-plants and submerging her body slightly to glue a bunch of eggs to the plant's stem or leaf. The eggs of these dragonflies are usually bright apple-green in color. The larvae that hatch from these eggs are very active, equipped with six legs, and small wing-pads on their thorax. The larva also possesses a unique mask-like structure that conceals its face but unfolds to reveal sharp hooks for catching prey. Furthermore, the larva has a syringe-like mechanism that propels it forward by expelling water behind it, aiding in both movement and respiration.|"1. What is the main topic of the text?

During the summer months of July and August, Dragonflies, specifically the species Libellula, are most abundant. These dragonflies lay their eggs by attaching them in loose clusters to the stems of plants that grow in water. The process of laying eggs involves the female dragonfly alighting on water-plants and submerging her body slightly to glue a bunch of eggs to the plant's stem or leaf. The eggs of these dragonflies are usually bright apple-green in color. The larvae that hatch from these eggs are very active, equipped with six legs, and small wing-pads on their thorax. The larva also possesses a unique mask-like structure that conceals its face but unfolds to reveal sharp hooks for catching prey. Furthermore, the larva has a syringe-like mechanism that propels it forward by expelling water behind it, aiding in both movement and respiration.|"6.

Dragonflies go through fascinating transformations, observable in aquaria. Agrion, for instance, has tracheary leaves acting as false-gills, aiding in swimming. These leaves absorb air for the tracheae, not for blood aeration. Little is known about their habits, making observation valuable. Differentiating Libellula and Æschna larvae is possible by the former's shorter, hairier form. Pupa, like Cordulia lateralis, have larger wing-pads, becoming gourmands before emerging as adults. During emergence, the pupa climbs a plant, shedding its skin to reveal a soft body that hardens. The adult dragonfly emerges, initially torpid, with wings drying to reveal vibrant colors. Devil's Darning-needles, like Eschna heros and grandis, are large and colorful, often causing alarm when entering homes.|"1. What is the purpose of the tracheary leaves in Agrion larvae?

Few naturalists have focused on studying mites, with only a handful contributing to scientific journals. Mites, part of the Arachnid order, have a rounded oval body without the usual head-thorax and abdomen division found in spiders. They possess four pairs of legs and specialized mouthparts for feeding. While some mites are parasitic, others feed on insect eggs or act as beneficial scavengers. The transformation of mites from young to adult is remarkable, with some forms exhibiting significant differences. For instance, the larva of the European mite Typhlodromus pyri has only two pairs of legs and a worm-like appearance. Observations of mite stages, like those found on a Downy Woodpecker, provide insights into their rapid growth and metamorphosis.|"1. What is one characteristic that distinguishes mites from spiders?

"Here is a refined passage for middle school students:

The fascinating world of mites holds many surprises. Some mite species exhibit parthenogenesis, where females lay eggs without males. These tiny creatures can suddenly swarm in large numbers, causing annoyance. For example, the Cheyletus seminivorus mite can harm cabbage seeds by sucking them dry. Another mite, resembling the Acaropsis Mericourti, was found in New Orleans and is thought to have been extracted from a human face. Additionally, a mite similar to Gamasus was discovered living in a steer's ear. The most complex mite, akin to spiders, is the red garden mite like Trombidium. In the larval stage, the Leptus Americanus mite is brick red and causes intense irritation by staying just under the skin.

Haliday noted the opinions of Linnæus and Schrank on Campodea, linking it to the Podura genus. He suggested Campodea was an intermediate link between Podura and Lepisma. The mouth-parts of Campodea are rudimentary and retract into the head, resembling Poduridæ mouth-parts. The Podurelles and Collembola groups were studied by Nicolet and Lubbock. Lubbock found differences between Lepismidæ and Poduridæ, proposing the term Collembola for the Podura group. Various experts like Lamarck, Gervais, and Professor Dana had differing views on the classification of these insects. The Poduridæ are commonly found in damp places like under stones, wet chips, or in cellars. They thrive in moist and shaded environments, laying eggs mostly in spring and autumn. Their body varies in size and shape across different genera, with distinct head features and simple eyes on top behind the antennae.|"1.

Studying the mouth-parts of insects can be challenging, but by soaking them in potash for 24 hours to make their bodies transparent, we can observe them clearly. The mouth-parts of Poduras are similar to those of other insect orders like Neuroptera, Orthoptera, and Coleoptera, with some parts being degraded or obsolete. The mouth appears as a simple ring with a labrum, jaws, maxillae, and labium. The mandibles are slender with teeth for crushing food, while the maxillae have lobes at the end. The spring of Poduras consists of three-jointed appendages that are homologous to the ovipositor of higher insects. Another overlooked organ in Achorutes resembles an ovipositor and may be used for egg-laying. Understanding these structures helps us see similarities between Poduras and other insects.|"1.

The Poduras, unique insects, have a special organ on their abdomen that helps them attach to smooth surfaces. They lay their eggs under stones or tree bark, and the embryos develop similarly to Caddis flies. The larva is white, short, and stout, differing from the adult. After molting, it becomes purplish and slender. The larva hatches within 6 to 10 days, showing similarities to Neuropterous Mystacides. Sir John Lubbock studied their internal anatomy, focusing on the respiratory system with tracheae found in Smynthurus. These creatures show a degradation process where they acquire Thysanurous characteristics. Lubbock's dissections have enhanced our understanding of their internal structure, shedding light on their unique respiratory system with spiracles on the head.|"1.

Tomocerus is a common species with unequal abdominal segments, simple hairs, and scales. It has very long four-jointed antennae with ringed terminal segments and seven eyes on each side. The mouth-parts are enlarged in Fig. 161, showing mandibles, maxillae, maxillary palpus, labium, labial palpus, lacinia, and a ventral sucking disk. The markings on the scales vary greatly, making them unreliable as test objects. Lepidocyrtus, another species, has unequal abdominal segments, long four-jointed antennae, and eight eyes on each side. A species of Lepidocyrtus found in New England is depicted in Fig. 172. The mouth-parts in this genus are similar to Tomocerus. Lipura and Anura are in the Lipuridae family, lacking a spring mechanism. Lipura fimetaria is a common white species in Europe. Lubbock notes that Lipuridae currently includes Lipura and Anura, with similar mouth structures but no spring mechanism.|"4. What is a common characteristic of Lipuridae family members?

Studying the growth of insects from their egg stage reveals a common design in their development. The earlier stages of a bee, fly, or beetle germ all share a resemblance, suggesting a common ancestor. This idea aligns with the studies of Von Baer, Lamarck, and Darwin, prompting questions about the origin of species and the forces guiding life. The theory of evolution, though debated, offers a powerful tool in understanding biology. Just as the nebular hypothesis aids geology and the atomic theory aids chemistry, evolution theory in biology helps unravel the mysteries of creation. Despite objections, many naturalists find the theory essential for their work and believe it will become fundamental to biology, much like other scientific theories.

The first to discuss the ancestry of insects was Fritz Müller in 1863. He suggested that insects might have evolved from a Zoëa, a larval form of crabs. However, there are significant differences between insects and crustaceans. Hæckel, in 1866, also proposed a similar idea. Friedrich Brauer supported this theory in 1869, suggesting that Podurids might be the ancestors of insects. Sir John Lubbock agreed, stating that Campodea could be the primordial type from which various insect orders originated. Despite these theories, the exact ancestry of insects remains debated. Some believe insects may have evolved from worm-like aquatic creatures. Discoveries of ancient insect fossils in rocks have pushed back the origins of insects to earlier periods, challenging previous assumptions.

This stage is more active than previous ones. New organs like air tubes and fat bodies develop. During the pupa stage, imaginal disks form, which will become the adult skin. The development of Platygaster involves rudimentary appendages, while in flies like Muscidæ and Corethra, the disks build the entire body. Polynema, an egg-parasite, lays eggs in dragonfly eggs, developing similarly to Platygaster. The sting of the adult consists of three pairs of tubercles. Ophloneurus, another egg-parasite, remains within its egg membrane and transitions directly to the pupa stage.

In his remarkable discoveries, Ganin highlights the unique formation of eggs and germs in these parasites compared to other insects. The eggs lack nutritive cells, and the germ's primitive band formation is delayed until the second larval stage. The embryonal membrane differs from other insects and may be similar to certain crustaceans. Ganin notes the provisional organs of larvae are distinct and may be found in parasitic crustaceans. He compares the development of egg parasites to a leech, Nephelis. Ganin suggests that comparative embryology holds the key to understanding the genealogical relations of animals. The acceleration and retardation in the growth of these parasites hint at evolution theories. The diversity in larval forms among ichneumon flies raises questions about their ancestral connections. Ganin's findings support the theory that insects trace their lineage back to worms.|"1. What does Ganin highlight about the formation of eggs and germs in parasites compared to other insects?

The path from ancient creatures to modern insects is a fascinating journey. It's possible that insects evolved from lowly worms like the Syllis, with appendages resembling those of insects. The development of tracheae and wings in insects was a crucial step. Tracheae, initially simple tubes, evolved to aid in respiration and flight. The aquatic Protoleptus, the ancestor of Leptus, likely had similar structures for buoyancy, which later transformed into tracheae for breathing. Wings, essential for flying insects, may have initially been gill-like organs in aquatic larvae, aiding in movement and blood oxygenation. The loss or acquisition of wings in insects is influenced by their habits and environment. The gradual evolution of these features has led to the diverse forms of insects we see today, from dragonflies to grasshoppers, each with unique adaptations for survival.|"1.

Insects go through various changes as they grow. For instance, grasshoppers leave the egg looking quite similar to adults but without wings. On the other hand, bee larvae are very different from adult bees. Young grasshoppers are active right after hatching, while bee larvae are more like embryos. This is similar to how human infants rely on parents, like wasp maggots do. Evolutionists are puzzled by how caterpillars change into butterflies with sucking mouthparts. Researching different insect groups reveals that terms like biting and sucking insects are not absolute. Mandibulate insects like beetles can have huge jaws for sucking blood, not tearing flesh. Mouthparts in insects like bugs vary greatly, making terms like 'haustellate' misleading. For example, house flies use a fleshy labium for sucking, while horse flies have adapted mandibles and maxillae for piercing.

In the Cecropia moth, the evolution of mouthparts varies greatly among different species. For instance, the Platysamia Cecropia has completely lost its maxillae, while the Macrosila cluentius from Madagascar boasts a tongue extending to nine and a quarter inches, ideal for reaching deep nectaries in orchids. These adaptations are closely linked to the insects' habits and environments. Some argue that these changes are a result of use and disuse, while others claim they are merely correlated. Similarly, the stingers of bees and ovipositors of other insects like the Ichneumon fly and saw fly share a common origin, evolving from three pairs of tubercles in the larval stage.

In this calendar, we focus on harmful insects. Their appearance times vary across regions, with Texas seeing them six weeks earlier than Labrador. The emergence of insects aligns with the blooming of specific plants. For example, the American Tent caterpillar and Canker worm larvae hatch as apple trees start leafing out. By early June, when forests and orchards are fully leafed out, insects arrive to feed on the foliage. In April, gardeners should clean fruit trees to remove bark lice eggs that hatch in May. Caterpillars and insects often overwinter under tree bark. Look for Canker worm and Tent caterpillar eggs on tree shoots. Detect and eliminate Apple Tree Borer by searching for its castings at the tree base and removing the young grub. This season offers opportunities to catch and control these pests, along with cylindrical bark borers and weevils like Pea weevil, Pine weevil, and others.|"1.

In the family of moths called Phalænidæ, which includes Geometers, Loopers, or Span-worms, there are two pests that trouble fruit growers. The Canker worm is a well-known threat. By taking proper care and being proactive, their damage can be greatly reduced. It is suggested to domesticate English sparrows, doves, and other insect-eating birds to help control these pests. Farmers should focus on destroying the eggs laid in the fall and spring, as well as the wingless females that crawl up trees to lay eggs. Vigilance is key, as the damage is often done before it's noticed. Regularly checking and clearing trees of caterpillars can help. Collaboration among farmers to form a Board of Destruction could effectively combat this issue. The Canker worms hatch in May, damaging fruit trees by eating tender leaves. It's crucial to take preventive measures to protect the trees. Other pests like the May beetle and Rose beetle can also harm crops and require attention. Additionally, flies and aphids can infest plants, causing damage that needs to be addressed promptly.|"1. What is suggested as a method to control pests like Canker worms in fruit trees?

The Seventeen-year Cicada, a destructive insect, has caused significant harm to apple, peach, and quince trees in Yellow Springs, Ohio. These insects bore into fruit-bearing twigs, causing branches to break and fruit to be lost. While plum and cherry trees have been spared, the Cicadas have attacked grapevines, blackberries, raspberries, elms, maples, ash trees, willows, catalpas, honey-locusts, and wild roses. They have been spotted from Columbus, Ohio, to St. Louis, with visits to Washington and Philadelphia. Other pests like the Hop-vine moth, Ilythia colonella, Spindle-worm moth, Bark borers, Blight beetles, and Tree crickets are also active this month. Insects are preparing for winter by finding shelter or laying eggs. The American Silk worm, for example, spins a cocoon to hibernate in as the weather turns colder.|"1.

On a warm day in autumn, one might notice clouds of insects, mostly ants, filling the air, especially at sunset when the sun's rays shine through them. These ants are swarming as it is their marriage day. The workers are the ones who hibernate and take care of the eggs and larvae produced by the females. In September, the females swarm, mate, and establish new colonies. Dr. C. C. Abbot observed a similar swarming event in New Jersey, where red ants emerged from their underground home for the first time, using their delicate wings. These ants seemed confused and ill at ease, trying to navigate their way through the grass with their wings. Eventually, they would take flight, rising slowly upwards with the help of the wind. This behavior is similar to that of Saüba ants in South America, where workers clear the exit paths for the winged individuals during their exodus in January and February.|"1.

The time of day aligns with Mr. Bates' observations. Around 4 P.M., we first spotted the winged ants, likely starting their flight, which lasted until nearly 7 P.M., well past sundown. The following morning, no ants were visible above ground, and the nest appeared empty, with a few ants in a semi-dormant state. Many ants were likely carried by the wind, unable to return home, while others landed on nearby trees, damaging their wings. It remains a mystery how these insects find their way back to their nest. Females that don't return establish new nests. In Maine and Massachusetts, we've noted ant swarms on warm September days. The White Pine Plant lice lay eggs on pine needles, attracting various insects. This passage introduces Entomology, focusing on insects' habits, transformations, and economic impact.|"1.
