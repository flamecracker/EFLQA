Women ponder, release bits of anger like darts, leaving you defenseless. A prick hurts more than a cut, as seen in the battle with the Moors. Men endure wounds silently but cry out over small pains. Your mother was skilled at pricking with her words, causing discomfort. Ships are easier to understand than women, who can be unpredictable. Men think they can manage women, but it's a perilous journey. The ship Swan was being revamped, James Standing and Reuben Hawkshaw overseeing the repairs. Reuben ordered top-quality provisions, surprising the merchants. They were used to cheap supplies, not the high-quality ones Reuben demanded.

I decided to head towards this point because we need to avoid the large islands, which are all under Spanish control. The Spaniards have displaced the natives on these islands and use them as slaves for their plantations and mines. Looking at the map, you can see that there are no Spanish posts in the islands we will be passing by, except for a small one at San Salvador. We will sail through these islands until we reach Columbus Point on San Salvador, the island Christopher Columbus discovered in 1492. From there, we will head west towards Andros and then due west. This route will keep us away from the typical path of the Spaniards, who head south towards Porto Rico before reaching Hispaniola and Cuba. We must navigate carefully, especially around the numerous scattered small islands that pose a sailing hazard, especially at night. It is crucial to compare our logbooks daily to correct any navigation errors, especially in accounting for drift caused by the wind. Our goal is to find an island with water and fruit to replenish our supplies without having to fight the Spaniards or the natives. If we encounter the natives, we must show them our peaceful intentions to trade. As we approach the first island, we must signal our peaceful intentions with a white flag and be prepared to defend ourselves if necessary.|"1.

Malinche shared with me that each year, a special prisoner is chosen for sacrifice, treated with respect and luxury until the time of death. I wish I were back with my companions, facing the unknown alone among people who breathe smoke and offer gifts one day, possibly death the next.

I hope to make allies, knowing the priests hold great power. Armed with a sword, I ventured to the Great Temple, where a pyramid structure loomed, adorned with an eerie display of human skulls.

Roger decided to stick to his beliefs without offending the locals' religious sentiments. Despite being startled by the sight of a heap of skulls, he controlled his emotions and tried to count them. Roger struggled with the Aztec method of counting but estimated around a hundred thousand skulls in the pile. This led him to ponder the vast number of human sacrifices across the country. He expressed that gods like Quetzalcoatl, who taught men peacefully, wouldn't approve of such bloodshed. The Aztec governor seemed uneasy at the thought, while the Tezcucan envoys were pleased as their people practiced a milder form of worship. Roger firmly stated his allegiance to a god of peace and refused to partake in human sacrifices. The Aztec governor, impressed by Roger's knowledge of Quetzalcoatl, reported their conversation to Emperor Montezuma, who, though mild, was influenced by the priests who favored sacrifices.|"1.

Roger was silent for the rest of the journey that day. His initial admiration for the arts and civilization of the people had turned into abhorrence. He had learned from Malinche that victims sacrificed to the gods were cooked and eaten, and seeing the heap of human skulls made him believe it. Despite the warm welcomes and celebrations in each city they passed, Roger felt low and depressed. He couldn't shake off the feeling of bloodshed everywhere. Learning that sacrifices were made to please the gods before his arrival added to his distress. He felt like a mockery, hearing the screams of the victims amidst the joyful greetings. The priests, unsure of his standing, kept away from him. They held the knowledge and practices of the nation, including astrology and divination. The Aztec priests were skilled in various sciences and were divided into different ranks and classes. They were devoted to specific deities and had quarters within the temple precincts. The priests led a disciplined life, practicing fasting and penance. They administered baptism, confession, and absolution rites, similar to Christian practices. The repetition of forgiven sins was considered unforgivable. Education was a crucial duty of the priesthood, with separate buildings for youth education within each city's main temple. Boys and girls were trained in various disciplines, with girls taught by priestesses. The discipline in these schools was strict, focusing on tradition, law, hieroglyphics, government principles, and sciences. Girls were trained in feminine skills like weaving and embroidery|"1.

The temples were funded by lands given by rulers and managed by priests, seen as good leaders treating tenants kindly. They received first fruits and rich gifts, sharing extra with the needy, as charity was vital. The Aztec faith had both good and bad aspects. It had strong morals akin to Christianity but also gruesome sacrifices. This mix was due to the blending of gentle Toltec beliefs with Aztec rituals. Roger, unaware of this, saw only the dark side. Traveling to the capital, they bypassed Puebla and Cholula, heading towards Mexico. The view amazed Roger, with Mexico City and Tezcuco visible.

Three departments were established in Tezcuco: the Council of War, the Council of Finance, and the Council of Justice. Citizens were allowed seats in these bodies alongside nobles and state officers.

The sight of their fallen comrades on the slope had dampened the spirits of the group. Their officers had been taken down by Roger's arrows, leaving the rest of the comrades to continue the pursuit from a distance. Roger and his companion focused on climbing, facing steep cliffs and making detours. After hours of effort, they reached the snow near two tall peaks. The Aztecs were far behind. They planned to descend until off the snow, then move through the woods to mislead their pursuers. Once in the forest, they hunted a bear for food. Roger contemplated the situation, knowing the Spaniards would intensify their search. He decided they should retreat across the mountains, head north, and seek refuge in the vast forests to evade capture, sustain themselves by hunting, and wait until the search subsided before considering their next move.|"1.

As they walked, a grand procession came into view. First, three important state officials carried golden wands, followed by the emperor in a luxurious palanquin, held up by nobles, under a canopy of feathers and jewels. Montezuma stepped down and, still sheltered by the canopy, approached Cortez with his brother and nephew.

They proceeded through the city, marveling at the splendid buildings, noble residences, and vibrant marketplaces. The grand temples and pyramids stood tall. The streets were lined with amazed onlookers, admiring the Spaniards and their Tlascalan allies. Crossing canals on bridges, they reached a square. The soldiers were housed in Montezuma's father's palace, fortified and guarded. The emperor visited, gifted the Spaniards, and departed. Cortez reciprocated the visit the next day, discussing Christianity with Montezuma, who politely declined to convert. The palace was vast, adorned with fountains and rich decorations.

Since your departure, things have been peculiar. I've mostly been in the capital. The news about the white people's progress surprised and worried everyone. The council met daily, but Montezuma spent his time with the priests, consumed by superstition. I respect our gods but believe one should think independently. Montezuma, however, relies heavily on the priests, causing indecision. We should have treated the strangers honorably from the start but failed. They were laden with gifts but barred from here. Despite orders, we seemed fearful upon their arrival. The plan to harm them at Cholula is disgraceful. The gods' prophecies were wrong, questioning the power of the white God. Roger warned of the Spaniards' cruelty and religious imposition. Cortez likely seeks riches, religious expansion, adventure, and honor. He may report back and receive more forces. Cortez is uneasy, unsure of Montezuma's plans, and apprehensive about an attack. He asked me to gauge opinions on the Spaniards. Ignorant opinions are deemed worthless by Cacama.|"1.

The Spaniards may underestimate the bravery of the Mexicans, who fought valiantly in the recent attack. As tensions rise, I feel torn between loyalty to the Spaniards and the fear of being sacrificed by the Mexicans. The city remains silent, with the Spaniards confined within the palace, hoping for a peaceful resolution.

In just thirty minutes, the messenger returned swiftly, wounded in many places. He brought news that the city was in an uproar, the drawbridges were up, and the Mexicans were marching towards the palace.

The terraces and roofs nearby were filled with natives shouting and waving weapons. The trumpet sounded for battle, and every soldier quickly took their position. The palace was defensible against a large enemy without artillery due to its strong wall and turrets. The Aztecs advanced with battle cries, raining down missiles. The Spaniards fired cannons through embrasures, causing heavy casualties. The Mexicans tried to climb the walls but were repelled. The fight raged on until night, with the Mexicans eventually retreating. Cortez planned a fierce response the next morning, but was surprised by the organized and determined Mexican forces.

The Spaniards fired cannons through embrasures, causing heavy casualties. The Mexicans tried to climb the walls but were repelled.

The large crowd surrounding the palace looked different from the day before when the Mexicans fought in their usual clothes or padded armor. Today, they wore only loincloths as their cotton armor was useless against the Spaniards' weapons. The chiefs stood out with their colorful clothes and metal breastplates over feather work.

The Aztecs initially fled but regrouped behind barricades, fighting fiercely with arrows and stones. The Spaniards charged through, facing relentless attacks.

During the intense battle at the temple summit, both sides were fully engaged, leaving other areas silent. The combatants were fixated on the struggle, unaware of its outcome.

Cortez, hoping to break their spirit, addressed the Mexicans the next day, but their resolve remained unshaken. One chief boldly declared that they were ready to sacrifice a thousand lives for every one taken by the Spaniards. The garrison, facing dwindling provisions and mounting casualties, felt deceived and trapped within their fortress, surrounded by relentless enemies.|"1.

The town of Xaltocan, located on an island, was the first target of the Spanish invaders. They faced initial setbacks as the dike leading to the town was sabotaged, causing great hardship.
