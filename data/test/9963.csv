"Playing a fun game called ""Stage-coach Story"" is a great way to have a good time with your friends. In this game, one person starts a story and includes the names of different parts of a stage-coach, like wheels, window, whip, horses, and driver. The other players have taken on these names and need to be alert. Whenever their name is mentioned in the story, they must quickly stand up, turn around, and sit back down. If they miss doing this, they have to pay a forfeit. When the word ""stage-coach"" is said, everyone changes seats. It's a lively game that brings lots of laughter and enjoyment.
