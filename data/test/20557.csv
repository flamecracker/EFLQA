The beauty and functionality of flower borders rely on the selection and arrangement of flowers. When planning a border, consider the height, color, and blooming seasons of the plants. Taller plants should be at the back, with none exceeding five feet in height for a six-foot-wide border. To create a vibrant display, arrange flowers in groups of four to six along the entire length. Ensure a continuous bloom by selecting flowers that flower each month. Perennials should be the mainstay, with annuals filling gaps. Traditional flowers offer the most satisfaction. Every four years, borders should be replanted after spading and manuring. Encourage students to study gardening literature for problem-solving.

"**Preserving Fruits through Drying and Canning**

Fruits are dried to extend their shelf life by removing moisture that bacteria and mold need to grow. This process allows fruits to be stored almost indefinitely. Dried fruits can be easily prepared by soaking them in water to restore moisture before cooking until soft. Canning is another common preservation method where fruits are sterilized by boiling to destroy germs and spores. To ensure success, all equipment coming in contact with the food must be sterilized too. Good covers and new rubbers are essential for sealing cans airtight. While sugar isn't necessary for sterilization, it can enhance flavor and prolong the fruit's freshness. Various methods like the ""Open-kettle Method"" and the ""Cold-pack Method"" can be used to can fruits and vegetables, each offering unique benefits for preservation.

Minerals in food are essential for regulating body functions and forming body structures and fluids. Fresh green vegetables, fruits, and milk are great sources of mineral compounds. Different foods have varying compositions; for example, rice is mostly carbohydrate, while butter is mainly fat. Milk is a complete food containing all five essential food groups, ideal for a baby's early months. As children grow, carbohydrates become crucial. Wheat is a nutritious food lacking only water, easily added during cooking. Meals should include protein, fats or carbohydrates, minerals, and water. Each day's diet should comprise all five food groups. Water intake should mainly occur between meals. Meals should be well-balanced and varied. Breakfast typically consists of simple foods like fruit, cereal, bread, and possibly eggs or meat. Dinner usually includes a hot protein dish, vegetables, soup, salad, and dessert. The table should be neatly set with individual places, cutlery, glasses, and napkins, making it attractive and inviting.|"5.

"Lesson VI from the course on Home Care covers setting and clearing the table. This lesson can focus on what to serve and how to serve it, or it can lead into the ""Waiting on Table"" lesson. Simple equipment like plates, cutlery, and napkins will be needed for family service practice. Students can plan a meal, set a table for four, and practice serving. Milk is a vital food source, especially for children. It contains essential nutrients but lacks starch, so it needs to be complemented with carbohydrate-rich foods for adults. The teacher can integrate lessons on cooking and serving food. Sour milk is beneficial in cooking and can produce tender bread. Cheese, rich in protein and fat, enhances the food value of dishes. Teachers can engage students in making menus and simple menu cards, fostering creativity and practical skills. Sour milk can be used to make cottage cheese, and leftover cereal can be repurposed in a rice pudding."|"1. What is a vital food source, especially for children, according to the text?

A soft dough requires one part liquid and three parts flour, while a stiff dough needs one part liquid and four parts flour. Before mixing, ensure the oven or griddle is at the right temperature. Test the oven by browning a piece of white paper or flour in three minutes. Grease the pans with lard, salt pork, or beef dripping. Have all ingredients measured and ready. Mix the batter until smooth and bake immediately. To make batters light, beat air into them, add eggs with beaten air, or entangle gas in the batter using soda and sour milk. Baking powder can be used instead of soda for sweet milk. Bake biscuits made from a dough of flour, fat, milk, and salt in a hot oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Remember, handle the dough lightly and quickly for the best results.|"5. What can you add to make batters light?

If beef and mutton are not common or easy to find, but rabbit is available, you can use rabbit instead of beef in the stew. After cleaning the rabbit well, cut it into eight pieces (four legs and four body pieces), season, coat with flour, brown in fat, and continue as you would with Beef Stew. Mix the dry ingredients together, add butter, and gradually mix in milk to form a soft dough. Roll out on a floured board, cut with a biscuit cutter, place on top of the stew (so they don't sink into the liquid), cover the pot tightly, let the stew simmer, and cook the dumplings for 10 minutes without lifting the lid. Place thin bacon slices in a hot pan, cook until crisp, and brown. Another way is to bake the bacon on a rack in the oven until crispy. If the meat needs a few hours to cook, split the lesson into two parts during the day. Prepare the meat and veggies half an hour before the morning session or during recess. Add veggies to the meat and make dumplings in the second class. Discuss the meat types, cooking methods, and food value. If possible, plan additional lessons on poultry. Peas, beans, and lentils are rich in protein, carbs, and minerals, making them a great meat substitute. They need to soak overnight and cook for a long time. Plan ahead if baking beans.

Running stitch involves passing the needle in and out of the material evenly on both sides. The teacher will demonstrate running stitch with a back-stitch. Students will sew the sides of the bag using this stitch, starting 3/4 inch from the top to leave space for the drawstring. Seams might need to be finished later. The drawstring is threaded through the hem, and slits are left for the cord. Students will learn to overcast seams neatly and discuss hemming depth, turning, and basting. If time runs out, hemming can be assigned as homework, with each student bringing their finished work to the next class.|"1. What is the first step students should take in sewing class?

For this lesson, instead of using cords, you can use narrow tape. Cut two pieces of tape, each twice as long as the bag's width plus two inches. Run one tape from one side and the other from the opposite side, encircling the bag entirely. Connect the tape ends this way: If students can't provide cords, the teacher should have enough on hand. Ensure bags are ready for the cord before class. Start by explaining how to make the cord, estimating the amount needed, and demonstrate with a student's help. Number students for group work. After running the cord into the bag, suggest ways to neatly finish the ends. This lesson will focus on running and weaving. Darning fills holes in material with thread to repair or reinforce weak spots. Use a darning-ball or cardboard under the hole. Extend the darn a quarter inch past the hole's edge, using fine stitches in rows in one direction, then crossing with rows at a right angle. Ensure no raw edges are visible by picking up and dropping the material's edge around the hole and weaving evenly in and out. Discuss foot and stocking care, demonstrate darning on coarse material with yarn and needle during class. Assign more darning practice if students finish one darn.

"A revised version for middle school students:

One plan, known as the ""Crete"" plan of Household Science, was first implemented in Nebraska, U.S.A. It involves teaching cooking skills in the homes of skilled women in the community under educational supervision. Initially used in small-town high schools, it can be adapted for rural schools. Women skilled in cooking become part of the school staff, teaching Household Science using their own kitchens. To start, interested women meet to discuss the plan and volunteer to instruct. Classes of six to ten students meet once a week at the instructor's home. Lessons cover recipes, ingredients, cooking methods, and common mistakes. Students take notes, practice at home, and receive feedback. After months of practice, students can showcase their dishes in a school exhibition. This practical approach allows students to learn real-life skills in a familiar setting."|"1. What is the ""Crete"" plan of Household Science?

For insulation in a fireless cooker, various materials can be used. Asbestos and mineral wool are the safest as they are non-flammable. Other suitable options include ground cork, hay, excelsior, Spanish moss, wool, and crumpled paper. Among these, crumpled paper is preferred for its cleanliness and odorless properties, retaining heat effectively when packed correctly. To ensure air-tightness, line the box with heavy paper or newspaper layers. Asbestos sheeting can also be used. When using paper, crush single sheets and create a layer at least four inches deep at the bottom of the container, placing the inside container in the center and packing more crushed paper around it tightly. If using other materials, pack them similarly. For added safety with extra heat sources, non-flammable materials like asbestos or mineral wool are recommended. A pad of asbestos at the bottom and layers between the nest lining and packing material are advisable. The cooking kettle should be cylindrical, durable, and free from crevices, with a well-fitting lid. A metal lining is necessary if using an extra heat source to prevent fire hazards. A cushion filled with cotton, crumpled paper, or excelsior should fill the remaining space to ensure proper insulation.|"1. What are the safest materials for insulation in a fireless cooker?
