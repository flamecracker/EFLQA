By 1675, a law mandated the prompt construction of a meeting-house in every town, with magistrates authorized to build it at the town's expense if the residents delayed. Each church operated independently, with the power to manage its members and church affairs according to the guidelines of the Platform of Church Discipline."|"1.

"The early meeting-houses were simple structures, typically square log-houses with clay-filled chinks and thatched roofs. Initially, settlers took pride in adding lathing and whitewashing inside. These humble buildings, like the first one in Dedham measuring 36 feet long, were later converted into granaries or storehouses. As the colonists prospered, they built more elaborate sanctuaries, known as ""good roomthy meeting-houses."" The second style featured square wooden buildings with belfries if affordable, like the Old Ship in Hingham. These structures, replicated across New England, led to more sophisticated church architecture styles. Meeting-houses were often located on hilltops for defense against Indians, as landmarks, and for their aesthetic appeal. Despite their once prominent role, many of these churches now lie abandoned, with neglected graveyards serving as melancholic reminders of a bygone era. The colonial spellings in descriptions of these early meeting-houses showcase the varied and inventive language of the time."|"1. What were the early meeting-houses typically made of?

The church-raising was a significant event in the town. By law, every citizen had to participate or contribute to the construction of the meeting house. Nails were so scarce that some unscrupulous individuals would burn down empty buildings to salvage the nails. Each male resident had to provide a specific number of nails for the new church. Besides logs, lumber, and labor, a contribution was collected for a barrel of rum and other items. Accidents were common during these events, with men falling from scaffolding and getting injured. In some instances, like in Northampton in 1738, rum was bought to raise the meeting house, leading to injuries. Initially, meeting houses had oiled paper windows for light, but later glass panes were used. These early churches lacked shade due to the fear of forest fires, making them uncomfortably hot in summer and cold in winter.|"1. What was a significant event in the town according to the passage?

In the early days, the meeting-houses were adorned with strange decorations, such as wolves' heads nailed under windows and by doors, with blood stains below. The settlers feared wolves more than bears due to their destructive nature. Bears were abundant, with records showing the killing of twenty bears near Boston in just one week in 1725. Rewards were offered for wolf killings, with instructions to nail the wolf's head to the meeting-house. The meeting-houses served various purposes, including storing gunpowder until after the Revolutionary War. Punishment instruments like stocks and pillories were present, and the first man to occupy Boston's stocks was the carpenter who built them. The meeting-houses also stored grain and sometimes served as a place to dry tobacco leaves.|"1. What was one of the strange decorations found in the early meeting-houses?

In colonial New England, the meeting-houses in rural areas were left unpainted at first due to beliefs against vanity. However, as paint became more affordable in the mid-18th century, a competition arose to decorate churches. Towns would levy taxes and seek donations to buy paint. For instance, Pomfret's bright yellow meeting-house sparked envy, leading neighboring towns like Windham and Killingly to mimic its colors. Brooklyn's church went all out, painting its exterior bright orange with chocolate-colored doors and white trim. Inside, simplicity reigned with wooden rafters, sand floors, and benches. A peculiar feature was the sounding-board above the pulpit, ornately decorated but serving little purpose beyond reflecting sound. Children found amusement in studying the knots and veins in the unpainted wood of pews and galleries, while dusty spider webs and cobwebs provided distractions during lengthy sermons. Additionally, Puritans used to carry guns to church for protection against Indians and wolves, a practice that continued for many years.|"1.

The New Haven church in Colonial times took great care to ensure safety on the Sabbath. They made bullets common currency to ensure everyone had them, instructed colonists on what to do in case of attack, and required men to bring powder and shot to meetings. The church resembled a garrison, with soldiers seated at the main door, cannons mounted nearby, and armed watchers patrolling the streets. However, not all soldiers behaved with decorum, as disorderly incidents were reported. Despite these events, the union of church and army was accepted, with military exercises starting and ending with prayer and psalm-singing. In other settlements like Concord and York, armed men attended church services due to the constant threat of Indian attacks. The men always left the church first to ensure the safety of women and children. The assembly for the Sabbath service was signaled by sounds like Abraham Tyler's horn or the blowing of a conch-shell.|"1. What did the New Haven church do to ensure safety on the Sabbath?

The New Haven church in Colonial times took great care to ensure safety on the Sabbath. They made bullets common currency to ensure everyone had them, instructed colonists on what to do in case of attack, and required men to bring powder and shot to meetings. The church resembled a garrison, with soldiers seated at the main door, cannons mounted nearby, and armed watchers patrolling the streets. However, not all soldiers behaved with decorum, as disorderly incidents were reported. Despite these events, the union of church and army was accepted, with military exercises starting and ending with prayer and psalm-singing. In other settlements like Concord and York, armed men attended church services due to the constant threat of Indian attacks. The men always left the church first to ensure the safety of women and children. The assembly for the Sabbath service was signaled by sounds like Abraham Tyler's horn or the blowing of a conch-shell.|"2. How did the church resemble a garrison in Colonial times?

In the early days of East Hadley, the person who played the conch shell and cleaned the meeting-house received a yearly payment of three dollars. Drumming, on the other hand, was considered a more skilled task and drummers were paid more. The drum was often used to gather people for worship, and in some towns, it was the primary way to notify the community. The use of drums for church gatherings continued until the introduction of bells. In some cases, flags were also used to signal the time for religious services. The ringing of bells in Boston on Sundays is believed to have been done using hand-bells initially. The church bells, sometimes hung on trees, caused distress to the native Indians.

In some churches, congregants would sit in their pews upon arrival, rising when the parson, clad in a black skull-cap and Geneva cloak, entered. They stood as a sign of respect until he took his place in the pulpit. In 18th-century New England churches, it was customary for the whole congregation to remain standing after the service until the minister descended from the pulpit, escorted his wife from her pew, and greeted others as they left. Early meeting-house benches were long, narrow, and uncomfortable, with no back support. Wealthier families eventually had their own family pews, each uniquely designed. A boy once caused a commotion by attempting to walk on the narrow ledge of a pew's foot-bench, resulting in a noisy crash and a scolding from the minister.|"1.

In early New England churches, seating arrangements caused much strife and contention. The minister's family had a special square pew, but with large families, there were constant debates over enlarging or rearranging seating. The gallery seats were considered the most prestigious, leading to jealousy and disputes. The process of assigning seats caused disappointment, jealousy, and quarrels in the community. To restore peace, some churches equalized the dignity of seats. Wives had to have seats of equal importance to their husbands, and widows retained their husband's seat dignity. The process of dignifying seats lasted for years and was not abandoned until the early 19th century in some churches. Some towns had detailed rules for seating based on age, office, military service, and financial contributions. In some cases, pews were even sold to the highest bidder to resolve disputes.|"1.

The minister's family had a special square pew, but with large families, there were constant debates over enlarging or rearranging seating. The gallery seats were considered the most prestigious, leading to jealousy and disputes. The process of assigning seats caused disappointment, jealousy, and quarrels in the community. To restore peace, some churches equalized the dignity of seats. Wives had to have seats of equal importance to their husbands, and widows retained their husband's seat dignity. The process of dignifying seats lasted for years and was not abandoned until the early 19th century in some churches. Some towns had detailed rules for seating based on age, office, military service, and financial contributions. In some cases, pews were even sold to the highest bidder to resolve disputes.|"5.

In the olden days, honor and respect in the community were displayed through seating arrangements in meetings. Judge Sewall, proud when his wife was seated in the foreseat, later regretted his pride when she passed away. Often, there was a lack of seating in the meeting-houses, leading to complaints of people squeezed on stairs. Some brought chairs into the aisles, causing nuisances. In some towns, laws were passed to remove these extra seats. Young men and women sat separately, with select groups being allowed to build pews. There were instances of objections and protests, like when bachelors in Newbury broke a pew built by young women, leading to fines and punishments. The restrictions placed on single men in the colonies may have fueled their objections to young women owning pews.|"1.

"Infants were carried to church by their mothers, who sometimes sat outside listening to the sermon while tending to their babies. In the old meeting-houses, there were small cages for very young children who couldn't sit alone.

"The Norwalk community is remembered for their lenient approach to discipline. The tithingman was only allowed a small stick and instructed to use it with kindness. However, misbehaving boys faced public punishment. In contrast, Hartford boys endured harsh treatment by the church, being publicly disciplined during worship.

During Puritan times in the 17th century, church-goers were expected to stay awake during long, droning sermons. Tithingmen were appointed to ensure everyone stayed alert.

The President, after missing his way on a trip through Connecticut, had to ride on a Sunday morning to make it to town for church. Along the way, he was stopped by a Tything man who questioned his reasons for traveling. Only after explaining his situation and promising not to go further than the town intended, was the President allowed to continue his journey. This incident highlights the role of the ancient tithingman, who enforced various laws and rules, including those related to Sabbath activities. In colonial times, time was marked by sundials and hour-glasses, with a tithingman turning the hour-glass during religious services as a reminder of time passing. Sermons could be very long, lasting several hours, and some clergy members resisted changes like introducing Sunday schools. Despite efforts to prolong sermons, changes eventually took place, showing that traditions evolve over time.|"1. What role did the Tything man play in the text?

Along the way, he was stopped by a Tything man who questioned his reasons for traveling. Only after explaining his situation and promising not to go further than the town intended, was the President allowed to continue his journey. This incident highlights the role of the ancient tithingman, who enforced various laws and rules, including those related to Sabbath activities. In colonial times, time was marked by sundials and hour-glasses, with a tithingman turning the hour-glass during religious services as a reminder of time passing. Sermons could be very long, lasting several hours, and some clergy members resisted changes like introducing Sunday schools. Despite efforts to prolong sermons, changes eventually took place, showing that traditions evolve over time.|"2. What was the President's reason for traveling on a Sunday morning?
A) To attend a wedding
B) To visit a friend

In the early days of New England, lengthy prayers were highly valued, with some lasting up to two hours. The Puritans, who left the Church of England to avoid brief prayers, considered long prayers a sign of devotion. Standing during prayers was common, and ministers paused to allow the weary to sit. Despite discomfort and long services, complaints were rare. The congregation stood during prayers until recent times, honoring tradition and faith. Ministers were trained in prayer on various occasions, enabling them to face challenges. A story of a minister out-praying an Indian medicine-man illustrates the power of prayer. Over time, as people became less patient, services were shortened. In the past, attendees were not allowed to leave until the service ended. Eventually, as other forms of entertainment emerged, church services were shortened, providing relief to both ministers and congregants.|"1.

Judge Sewall described an extreme cold storm in his diary. He noted how the bread froze at the Lord's Table and how even the ink froze while he tried to write by the fire. Despite the freezing conditions, he found comfort at the meeting. In colonial times, rooms were so cold that even sitting by a fireplace didn't provide enough warmth. This is why his ink froze while he wrote. Sewall also mentioned a day with extreme cold when a newborn baby was baptized in a freezing church. Children were always brought to the meeting-house for baptism, even in bitter weather. Sewall's diary entries about baptizing his children show his pride and hopes for their future. The minister once prayed for milder weather, and the next day, a thaw began, seen as a direct answer to the prayer. Some clergy were annoyed by the noise of the congregation trying to keep warm during long winter sermons. One clergyman even rebuked his freezing congregation with powerful words from the Bible to make them quiet.|"1.

In the olden days, ministers endured the freezing cold during services. They preached and prayed with mittens or gloves, donning long cloaks and skull caps to keep warm. Dr. Stevens of Kittery would check the church attendance on icy days. If only seven were present, he'd invite them to his warm home for the sermon. However, with eight, he'd brave the snow in his cloak, fur cap, and mittens to preach. The harsh winter conditions in the unheated churches were so severe that it's speculated whether illnesses like consumption originated from these icy settings. While men had adequate clothing, women's attire was scanty, with thin gowns and little protection from the cold. Women wore gloves, mittens, and enormous fur muffs to shield hands, along with various hoods and veils to cover their heads.|"1.

During harsh winter days, women used foot-stoves to keep warm in the cold meeting-houses. These metal boxes filled with hot coals from home or neighboring farms helped the women endure the icy chill. Children would huddle around their mothers' foot-stoves, warming their frozen fingers. Some foot-stoves were extravagant church decorations, like one made of brass with the owner's initials and a fancy chain. In some places, foot-stoves were banned to avoid fire hazards. In other instances, worshippers used fur bags or even brought dogs to provide warmth. Churches imposed fines for bringing dogs inside, showing the strict rules to keep the cold out.

"With all this supporting proof, I believe it is clear that the incident truly occurred in Litchfield and that the credit was wrongly attributed to other towns by dishonest chroniclers; otherwise, we would have to accept a remarkable agreement of church pranks and fake fainting spells across New England. The Puritan nature, stern and averse to pleasure yet glorying in trials, led our ancestors to forsake their English homes and come to these harsh, desolate shores for the love of God and freedom of conscience. They endured personal discomforts with fortitude and even satisfaction, clinging steadfastly to symbols of austere simplicity. The lack of warmth during worship was a testament to their dedication to a religion they believed thrived on Spartan severity. In early colonial days, a ""noon-house"" was often seen beside old meeting-houses, offering warmth and sustenance to congregants between services. These humble shelters provided respite from the cold, allowing worshippers to endure the long afternoon services with renewed vigor."|"1. What is the main idea of the text passage?

"In the past, churches did not have horse-sheds until after the War of the Revolution. These sheds were built to protect horses and carriages from the weather. In Longmeadow Church in 1796, a horse house was erected in the Meeting House Lane. Boys were not allowed to talk or play in these sheds. In some churches, the Bible was read to keep the boys quiet during the nooning. The boys were sometimes asked to explain sermon notes they had taken. Sabbath-schools were established later, gaining children's interest during the noon interval. The ""wretched boys"" of the Puritan Sabbath disappeared when families sat together in their own pews. The fashion of sermon-reading during the nooning was not common in all parts of New England. In many villages, the nooning was a time for townspeople to discuss news, events, and even horse-trading.

In early New England, wood for noon-house fires came from farmers in the congregation, each contributing a load. Wealthy landowners often provided cider for warmth, with a barrel worth as much as the wood. Cider prices varied, from six shillings in 1782 to ten shillings in 1679. The cider was a source of refreshment and warmth for farmers and church members. Some farmers built private noon-houses with cooking utensils for meals and drinks like hot toddies or flip made with beer, sugar, and rum.

"During the early days of New England, church deacons were responsible for caring for the vessels used in communion services. These vessels were sometimes stored under the pulpit in a closet near the ""Ministers wives pue."" Legend has it that this closet was also used to discipline unruly boys.

In the past, some New England churches had a unique custom where deacons had a significant duty. In Pelham, Massachusetts, during the late 18th century under Rev. Stephen Burroughs, church members received metal checks each month. These checks allowed them to participate in communion, and without one, they were temporarily excommunicated. Deacons distributed these checks to the deserving members, ensuring they were presented during communion. The absence of a check caused great embarrassment. Similar practices were observed in Londonderry, New Hampshire, where special tokens were required for communion. These tokens were presented to pious members by deacons and elders. The communities gathered for solemn services, followed by joyous celebrations and social gatherings. The use of tokens in these churches continued until the early 19th century.

Similar practices were observed in Londonderry, New Hampshire, where special tokens were required for communion. These tokens were presented to pious members by deacons and elders. The communities gathered for solemn services, followed by joyous celebrations and social gatherings. The use of tokens in these churches continued until the early 19th century. Today, some of these tokens are preserved in historical collections.|"6. What is one outcome of these historical practices in New England churches?
A) Increased church attendance
B) Preservation of historical collections
C) Decline in community gatherings
D) Rise of new religious customs
E) Expansion of church membership"|B) Preservation of historical collections|
"The deacons in different parishes had various tasks to complete. Some duties were shared with the tithingman. They visited church members' homes to hear children recite the catechism, prayed with the sick, and reported minor offenses.

Deaconesses were seen as more suitable for visiting the sick and afflicted. An aged deaconess in Holland had kept order in meetings and spoke with her ""guifts."" The old psalm book of Ainsworth, printed in Amsterdam in 1612, was cherished by the Pilgrims, adding a historical and charming touch to their worship.

Around 1639, New Englanders felt the need to restore the singing of Psalms in their churches. They were grateful for the translated Psalms but found many discrepancies from the original text. Thus, a new translation began, with prominent divines like Mr. Welds, Mr. Eliot, and Mr. Mather taking part. The Psalms were printed in 1640 at Cambridge. Mr. Dunster later refined the translation with the help of Mr. Lyon. Despite criticisms of the poetry, the translators prioritized faithfulness over elegance. The Psalms were revised over time, including the addition of Scripture-Songs. The hymns, though unique, may not have been as melodic as expected. The efforts to improve the Psalms continued, reflecting the evolving nature of religious texts.|"1.

"Rev. Elias Nason humorously comments on ""The Bay Psalm-Book,"" stating that Welde, Eliot, and Mather took on the challenging task of creating this unique piece of literature. They delved into Hebrew psalms and metrical psalmody, resulting in a version that underwent numerous revisions.

Lowndes's ""Bibliographers' Manual"" describes it as extremely rare and valuable, fetching thousands of dollars at auctions. The book was intended to be printed for a few hundred dollars. Copies of this book are scarce, but some are found in old church libraries or with collectors. They often bear personal notes, like when a Psalm was sung at a funeral or a prayer for grace. The book carries family histories, births, deaths, and even bad poetry. It's a glimpse into the lives of our New England forefathers and the importance they placed on this cherished book."|"6.

I admit openly that I always enjoy reading Sternhold and Hopkins' Psalms, even though critics may disapprove. The rough vigor and sweeping swing of the renderings impress me more than modern polished methods. These antique psalms evoke the olden times, with a distinct flavor that sets them apart from contemporary poetry. In New England, old, tattered psalm-books of different versions are found in libraries, attics, or among dusty books. Some settlers brought French Psalm-books to America, like the Marot and Beza's Version used by French Huguenot settlers. Marot, a French poet, created the first metrical psalm translation sung by the people, aiding the Reformation. Despite being under Church condemnation, Marot's psalm-songs gained popularity among nobles and courtiers, even though they were later banned by the Church.|"1.

"The serious and forward-thinking Calvin quickly embraced Marot's Psalms, expanded to fifty, and included them in the Genevan Confession of Faith. He recommended that they be sung with the solemn melodies composed by Guillaume Frane. Theodore Beza, a prominent theologian, aided in completing the collection, which saw high demand with ten thousand copies sold immediately, an impressive figure for that era. Marot, however, did not find contentment in Geneva with Calvin and the Calvinists.

Despite various editions, the French Psalm-Book's appearance evolved from lavish to simpler bindings over time due to changing perceptions.

Public worshipers a century ago had mixed feelings about fuguing. While some found it angelic and ecstatic, others deemed it heartless and tasteless. The tunes were criticized as trivial and irreverent by some, who believed they inflated the singers' egos rather than glorifying God. Fuguing tunes caused such a commotion that older churchgoers left mid-service. Some clergy preached against it, citing biblical passages to condemn the introduction of fuguing. Choirs used pitch-pipes to start on the same key, a practice that eventually led to the use of musical instruments, much to the dismay of Puritans who saw it as idolatrous. The use of pitch-pipes was often comical, with some disguised as Bible covers. Despite resistance, musical instruments gradually made their way into church services, sparking both amusement and outrage among congregants.|"1.

"In the early 18th century, the introduction of musical instruments like organs and violins into New England churches sparked controversy.

During colonial times, not only Quakers but other individuals also spoke out in meetings. In Salem and other towns, those accused of witchcraft would pretend to be afflicted during church services, disrupting the ministers.

The tale of his wrongdoings, as recounted by his peers, does not portray him as innocently gazing across the meeting-house. Instead, the narrative is just as entertaining as his own sorrowful and aggrieved description of his trial.

During the early days of Puritan ministers, they held significant influence in various aspects except for performing marriage ceremonies or leading prayers at funerals.

"Reading an old ""ordination-bill"" from a tavern-keeper, one gets a glimpse into the customs of the past. The bill from an ordination in Hartford in 1784 reveals the expenses incurred: keeping ministers, mugs of tody, cigars, wine, lodgings, bitters, breakfasts, punch bowls, dinners, wine bottles, flip mugs, and more.

Although there is no evidence to confirm that the poor benefitted from the remnants of the Boston feast, records from other towns reveal that any leftovers from the ordination-dinner were put to good use. Sometimes, they were used to provide food for the new minister's table. In one instance, the excess provisions were sold in Killingly to help settle the outgoing minister's salary arrears, demonstrating a commendable effort to balance the accounts. The dedication of a church during an ordination would naturally be a cause for additional celebration. An intriguing account of the feast at the dedication of the Old Tunnel Meeting-House in Lynn in 1682 describes a vibrant scene.

During the seventeenth century, the ordination of ministers was a significant event, often marked by disorder and opposition from the congregation. The Puritan ministers, once revered, now faced challenges and disruptions during their appointments. At the New North Church in Boston in 1720, the ordination of Rev. Peter Thatcher was marred by unruly behavior from opposing factions within the congregation. These disruptions, fueled by strong punch and rum, highlighted a shift in attitudes towards church leadership. The once absolute reverence for ministers gave way to irreverence and personal agendas, reflecting changing times and societal values. Amidst these challenges, the need for temperance reform became increasingly apparent, signaling a shift in the church's standing and the ministers' roles within the community.|"1.

"During the early years, the New England ministers were not always somber. Cheerful gatherings were held during ordination times, where they enjoyed generous amounts of sack and white wine sent by the Court as a mark of respect. The clergymen depicted in paintings were far from gloomy, as indicated by the presence of punch bowls, drinking cups, tobacco, and pipes in their portraits. The motto ""In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, in all things charity"" further reflected their jovial nature. Some ministers were known for their excellent cider, with one minister's cider being so good that an Indian visitor remarked that Adam and Eve should have made apples into cider instead of eating them. Despite their reputation for fine cider, some ministers also ventured into making stronger liquors and even operated distilleries. One pastor, Rev. Nathan Strong, faced bankruptcy due to his distilling venture, but his public image remained intact, and he even joked about his liquor-making endeavors. Impostors posing as ministers also plagued the early New England colonists, with some engaging in fraudulent activities while pretending to be clergymen.

"During the early years, the New England ministers were not always somber. Cheerful gatherings were held during ordination times, where they enjoyed generous amounts of sack and white wine sent by the Court as a mark of respect. The clergymen depicted in paintings were far from gloomy, as indicated by the presence of punch bowls, drinking cups, tobacco, and pipes in their portraits. The motto ""In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, in all things charity"" further reflected their jovial nature. Some ministers were known for their excellent cider, with one minister's cider being so good that an Indian visitor remarked that Adam and Eve should have made apples into cider instead of eating them.

During the early days of New Haven, a Puritan community deeply devoted to religion, a paradox arose. The town faced challenges in paying their minister due to issues with the currency and lack of contributions. In 1651, a decree was made to enforce payment to the minister's salary, even resorting to rating those who did not contribute on Sundays. Despite some objections, fines were imposed on dissenters, like Lieutenant Fuller, who criticized the law on ministers' maintenance. The community also took part in building the minister's house and meeting-house, contributing materials and labor. Pasturage for the minister's horse was provided in the village burial-ground, but abuses led to restrictions. Settlements and sums of money were given to ministers upon their ordination, as seen in the case of Mr. Smith in Sharon.|"1.

In the eighteenth century, Puritan ministers in New England were strong supporters of the American Revolution, fearing the English kings' intentions to establish Episcopacy in the colonies. After gaining independence, ministers faced financial struggles, often receiving worthless continental paper money as salaries. They resorted to bartering goods instead of accepting depreciated currency. Some ministers petitioned not to increase their salaries due to difficulties in receiving payments. Church members supported their ministers with various gifts like fish, turnips, and even whales. Donation parties and spinning bees were organized to provide ministers with household items and clothing.

In the past, New England preachers had various ways to supplement their income. They often received gloves and rings at weddings, funerals, and christenings, which they sometimes sold. For instance, the Rev. Mr. Elliot sold both gloves and rings. His record shows that in thirty-two years, he received an astonishing two thousand nine hundred and forty pairs of gloves. Despite the challenge of selling dead men's gloves, he managed to make about six hundred and forty dollars from selling them. To save money, many pastors and their families practiced frugal living. They wore homespun and patched clothing, made their candles from bayberries, and even gathered wild berries and mushrooms for food. Some ministers could not afford paper for writing sermons and had to be resourceful in their use of materials. Despite the financial challenges, these families managed to make ends meet through careful budgeting and resourcefulness.|"1.

In the early days of New England, ministers often had to engage in various money-making activities to support themselves and their families. Some were farmers during the week, while others took in young men to educate or prepare for college. One minister even educated over 300 young Puritans in his own home. Some ministers learned legal skills to draw up wills, while others dabbled in medicine, selling drugs and giving advice to their parishioners. There were also ministers who worked as coopers, carpenters, rope-makers, millers, or cobblers. One cobbler clergyman even worked on his shoes all week with his Bible open on his bench, marking sermon ideas with waxed shoe-thread.

"During Puritan times, ministers held immense authority and used their sermons to address personal matters. One clergyman cleverly announced a long-awaited birth in the congregation by preaching on ""Unto us a son is born."" Another minister, dealing with a sick servant at home, used the text ""My servant lieth at home sick."" Dr. Mather Byles substituted for a missing minister and preached on ""Put not your trust in princes."" Some ministers openly confronted parishioners through their sermons. One reproved a man hoarding corn needed by the town, using Proverbs xi. 26. Another sternly addressed a parishioner through the text ""Ephraim is joined to his idols, let him alone."" Personalities often clashed, like when a pastor indirectly criticized a judge through a psalm, met with a clever response. Ministers weren't shy about personal prayers either, as seen when Rev. Mr. Moody prayed for a young man's arrogance and for a young lady who didn't want public prayers. Their prayers were sometimes quite specific, like Mr. Miles praying for rain in a particular way.
