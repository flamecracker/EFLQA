Tom Swift, the young inventor, discussed his plans with his father. Tom mentioned flying the WHIZZER for a long journey and possibly visiting his dad. However, he also noted that if the aircraft needed more modifications, he couldn't predict when he would return. Tom assured his father that he would keep him updated through letters. Tom had recently equipped his aircraft, the RED CLOUD, with a wireless apparatus, allowing him to send and receive messages during flights. The wireless system used the frame's wires for transmission and had trailers for reception. Tom, along with Mr. Damon, arrived in Philadelphia to work on the airship. Mr. Fenwick suggested a long flight if the WHIZZER performed well, as the aircraft was provisioned for such journeys. The airship was tested in the yard with only a few individuals present.|"1.

Tom, Mr. Damon, and Mr. Fenwick boarded the airship, suspended beneath the gas bag with wing-like planes on each side. Tom's plan was to make the WHIZZER rise by moving her across the ground on bicycle wheels and then using the tilting planes to lift her into the air without relying on the gas bag. As the motor started and the propellers spun faster, the airship was secured by a rope attached to a spring balance to measure the engine's power. With a cheer from spectators, the WHIZZER sped across the ground. Tom, closely monitoring the instruments, increased the engine speed and raised the elevating plane to lift the craft. After clearing a fence, the airship soared into the sky. Tom adjusted controls, remarking on the successful flight without using the gas bag, while Mr. Fenwick marveled at the experience. The airship circled at a height of two hundred feet before rising to nearly five thousand feet after filling the gas bag, proving its capability beyond expectations.|"Question 1: How did Tom plan to make the WHIZZER rise into the air?

The WHIZZER, a fast airship, seemed to reach its maximum speed, almost 150 miles per hour. Tom, the pilot, struggled to control it as it flew over the ocean. Despite his efforts to ascend, the airship remained at the same level. Tom then attempted to descend, but the wind grew fiercer near the ocean's surface. As dawn approached, the pale light outside the cabin indicated the early morning hour. Tom noticed the need for oil in the engines and made the necessary adjustments. The passengers, Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick, discussed their progress over the ocean and the need to adjust their position. Suddenly, an explosion rocked the airship, causing a moment of panic before Tom regained control.|"1. What was the Whizzer's maximum speed?

Tom suggested they assess the situation by checking the main wing planes and the remaining gas. They were flying high, and even if they lost everything, the bag material could act as a parachute. Over an island, Tom took control, attempting a challenging task of landing a disabled airship in a storm on an unknown island. With the electrical apparatus off, Tom steered the airship skillfully to slow its descent. Despite the wind howling outside, Tom managed to guide the airship parallel to the island, gradually reducing its speed. As they neared the island, Tom aimed for a sandy beach for a landing. With only sixty feet to go, Tom made a final maneuver, hoping to land the airship safely on the island's beach.|"1. What did Tom suggest they assess first to understand the situation better?

With a loud crash, the WHIZZER landed on the sand. The airship ran a short distance before the bicycle wheels collapsed, causing the craft to crumple. Tom quickly moved away from the controls to avoid being crushed. Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick had cushioned themselves, preventing serious injuries. The airship was in ruins, with broken parts scattered around. Despite bruises and cuts, they managed to escape the wreckage. As they assessed the damage, the ground beneath them began to shake violently. Fearing for their safety, they watched as a large crack appeared nearby.

The shipwreck survivors had been stranded on Earthquake Island for a week, enduring various tremors and severe shocks that even caused parts of the island to sink into the sea. The group, led by Tom, Mr. Damon, and Mr. Fenwick, worked tirelessly in their shack, with the others assuming they were building a boat. The captain expressed their dire situation, hoping for a passing ship to notice their distress signal. Tom, utilizing salvaged electrical equipment from the wrecked WHIZZER, ingeniously set up a gasolene engine and dynamo to generate power. He also rigged a crude wireless communication system, with plans to send a distress message. With everyone's help, they strung wires from a tall dead palm tree to set up the communication setup, marveling at Tom's resourcefulness given their limited resources.|"1.

"""The concept is quite straightforward,"" explained the young innovator. ""In telegraphy, a message is transmitted through wires using a battery or dynamo to create a current.

Messages are sent by generating a current with a dynamo, which then travels through the air until reaching receiving wires. The receiver decodes the clicks into letters, words, and sentences.
