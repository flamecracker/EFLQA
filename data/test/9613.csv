The group now had time to observe their surroundings and quickly realized the danger they were in due to General Craufurd's stubbornness. In front of them stood a massive French army consisting of 24,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry, and 30 artillery pieces. The odds were overwhelmingly against the 4,000 British infantry, especially given the unfavorable position they were in. The British were on the edge of a plateau with steep terrain behind them leading to the Coa River, a mile away, with only one bridge across. General Craufurd wisely ordered a retreat as resistance was futile. The 43rd regiment held their ground, allowing the rest to retreat, and then cleverly broke through a wall to escape. The British troops, using the rough terrain to their advantage, retreated in good order. Fortunately, French internal conflicts prevented a full-on attack, allowing the British to escape. Major MacLeod and his men bravely charged the French skirmishers, buying time for the rest to retreat. The Scudamore brothers played a vital role in setting up a trap with a rope to halt the French cavalry, ensuring the safe retreat of the British forces.|"1.
