Perry took on the task while the others followed Steve to the edge of the breakers. They watched as Steve returned to the _Adventurer_, not attempting to swim but pulling himself along the line. His head was mostly underwater. After a while, he emerged, climbed back on deck, and disappeared briefly. Eventually, he reappeared and started the return trip. Perry and the others formed a line, helping Steve back to the beach. Steve reported that he had managed to secure something and found a tin cup. They tried to climb up the cliff but struggled in the darkness. Finally, they reached a small ledge where they huddled together for warmth. Steve attempted to start a fire but failed. They spent a miserable night, soaked and shivering, waiting for morning. Ossie fell ill but improved later. As dawn broke, they saw the _Adventurer_ still struggling in the waves, looking forlorn.|"6. How did the _Adventurer_ appear as dawn broke?

B) Sinking
C) Lost
D) Forlorn

Joe expressed his doubts about rescuing the stranded person, comparing it to a challenging task. After having breakfast, the group headed to the beach, feeling sore and stiff. Despite the heavy mist, limiting their visibility, they estimated being two miles from the mainland. They split into two groups to explore the island, agreeing to regroup within an hour. Surprisingly, they discovered the island was small, mostly rocky, with limited vegetation. Disappointed by the lack of progress, they decided to return, gathering firewood on the way. However, starting a fire proved difficult due to the dampness. Joe humorously compared their situation to Robinson Crusoe, suggesting that without a shipwreck, the fictional character would have struggled to survive.|"1.

The tide had receded, making Steve's journey back to the _Adventurer_ easier. He returned with a jug of gasoline, ready to start a fire. Joe joined him, and together they gathered supplies and food. After a satisfying breakfast of bacon and coffee, they waited for the tide to go down. The boys then inspected the _Adventurer_, finding it mostly intact, although flooded in some areas. Steve suggested plugging the leaks and using a pump to try to get the ship off the beach. However, the sand had buried the bow and propeller. Steve noticed a rock in the distance that could help them if they could attach a line to it. Their hope for rescue started to bloom.|"1. What did Steve return with to make starting a fire easier?

It was challenging work. Initially, the bow line was swapped for a smaller rope and taken through the rough waves to the ledge. Steve, with Joe and Han's help, managed to secure a large cable around the rock, protecting it with a blanket. They returned to the _Adventurer_ in triumph. Meanwhile, Phil directed the others to seal the seams with muslin strips. The cable was led to the windlass, and they pumped out the water. They waited to see if the caulking held. By noon, they ate cold rations and glimpsed sunlight. The wind calmed, and the mist cleared, revealing the mainland. They cheered and climbed the cliff to assess their location. Despite uncertainties, they awaited high tide optimistically. At sunset, they attempted to free the _Adventurer_ with the engine, windlass, and teamwork. Finally, with a shout, the boat budged, lifting spirits as they awaited high tide.|"1. What did Steve, Joe, and Han do to secure the large cable around the rock?

After that, it was only a matter of time. The cruiser slowly moved off the sand, floating more freely minute by minute until the stern found deep water. Within about thirty minutes, they had the boat riding clear and began pulling up the cable. Unable to free the rope from the rock, they had to cut it. They cautiously turned towards a lighthouse beacon on the shore. They had to keep the pump running as a leak emerged, but it wasn't a major issue. They were relieved to escape with only a few damages. Later, they anchored in a narrow harbor for the night but had to move ten miles down the coast for repairs. The hull needed more work than expected, requiring a week's stay. Most of the crew left by rail, leaving Steve and Phil to oversee repairs. The _Adventurer_ was eventually ready, shining with new paint, and set sail for Penobscot Bay.|"1. What was the crew's main challenge after the cruiser floated off the sand?

After two delays, a storm caused another setback, pushing their departure to late August for Squirrel Island. Han wanted to visit friends there, but since they had a week, they weren't in a rush. They stopped at Portland for supplies before aiming for Provincetown, planning to cover 125 miles by evening. While on the way, an object was spotted far off, revealed to be a wrecked schooner named Catspaw from Norfolk. The crew of the Adventurer and Follow Me observed the damaged vessel with its cargo of pine boards, masts broken, and deserted decks. Despite the crew's absence, they contemplated salvaging the lumber but decided it was too risky. The crews exchanged signals, acknowledging the sad fate of the abandoned ship.|"1.

The two boats cautiously approached the _Catspaw_, an abandoned vessel. Steve, Joe, and Han boarded the old ship, which was deserted with empty quarters and davits. Despite the water inside, the boys were confident the ship wouldn't sink due to the lumber. They worked hard to rig a jury-mast and set sail, preparing to tow the schooner to Portsmouth. After setting up a crew and supplies, they began the slow journey with the cruisers nearby. Despite the challenging weather and rough seas, the boys managed to set off, waving triumphantly as the _Catspaw_ slowly followed. Perry, feeling important, sat on the windlass, exchanging waves with the crew on the cruisers. The journey was slow but determined, with the boys ready for whatever challenges lay ahead.|"1.

Joe found steering the _Catspaw_ quite demanding compared to the _Adventurer_. His arms were exhausted when he handed over the wheel to Wink. Joe likened steering the _Catspaw_ with the high sea to handling a heavy scow. The _Adventurer_ and _Follow Me_ were sailing towards Boon Island with Kittery Point about thirty miles away. The crew estimated reaching Portsmouth Harbour by 2 a.m. Despite the potential risks due to bad weather or equipment failure, the crew remained optimistic and enjoyed the thrill of the adventure. Perry was thrilled with the excitement, while Wink preferred above-water adventures. Later, a tugboat approached the _Adventurer_, offering assistance, but the boys on the _Catspaw_ wondered if they should have accepted it. As darkness fell, the crew prepared lanterns to signal their position to the other boats. A squall hit around eight, making steering the _Catspaw_ challenging. By the end of the evening, the crew faced dark, stormy conditions, bracing themselves against the chilly wind.|"1.

Perry, who initially claimed not to be tired, eventually succumbed to sleep in the captain's cabin on the rolling ship. Joe, skilled at waking up at set times, roused everyone at two in the morning. They struggled to maintain their balance due to the increasing gale as they headed to the galley. Bert lit a fire while the rest went to the wheel. Wink, though weary, informed them of a ship, likely the _Adventurer_, in the distance. Perry, bundled in his slicker, kept watch, feeling the wind and spray relentlessly battering him. Despite his efforts, sleep threatened to overtake him. Perry, feeling lonely and anxious, tried to push away thoughts of the dangers they faced. The morning brought little relief as they found themselves still adrift at sea, with only the sight of a distant brig offering a glimpse of hope before it disappeared from view.|"1.

The boys had breakfast around 6:30 in the morning. There wasn't much left besides coffee and bread, and the situation didn't look good if the storm persisted. Perry mentioned he'd prefer drowning over starving. A positive turn occurred when the _Adventurer_ approached by 9:00, followed by the _Follow Me_ at noon, reuniting the schooner and the two convoys. Despite their low spirits, they had to wait as there was no chance of getting supplies. Dinner aboard the _Catspaw_ was meager with little left from breakfast. The cruisers brought some comfort, and as the wind calmed down around 5:00, they set sail towards the coast. They managed to get supplies from the cruisers just before darkness fell, bringing relief and hope to the exhausted crew.|"1. What did Perry mention he would prefer over starving?

The small boat narrowly avoided tipping over multiple times as it pulled away, and ten minutes later, the _Catspaw_ was once again trailing behind the cruisers. A hearty supper of bacon, potatoes, and plenty of bread lifted the crew's spirits, especially as the stars emerged and the sea calmed. The second night was peaceful as the weather cleared and the sea became almost normal. By early dawn, with sunlight glinting on the water, the Isles of Shoals beckoned from six miles away. The _Catspaw_ slowed as it neared the shore, passing Portsmouth Light by morning. The tired but proud crew went ashore at noon, seeking a well-deserved meal. They recounted their adventures to a reporter and later met with attorney Mr. Hyatt, who explained their legal claim regarding the salvaged ship and cargo.|"1.
