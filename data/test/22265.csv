After dinner, most of the boys, except Hans who headed to the _White Wings_ ship, gathered at Bay View.

"Merriwell's pals observed him closely, intrigued by his reaction. Although Frank appeared cheerful, a hint of uncertainty clouded his expression. Facing a dilemma for the first time, he hesitated.

Once before, a sense of desolation had gripped him strongly, and now that eerie feeling was returning. It seemed like he was far from civilization, lost in a desolate expanse of water, stranded on a mysterious island. He whispered to himself, aware that the dark and ominous woods were nearby. To reach the _White Wings_, he had to venture through them or retrace his steps to take a different path, risking encountering the men he had been observing. Denning, like Frank Merriwell, had been curious about the island's mystery and had vanished, with his grave later discovered on the island. No one dared open the grave to check if Denning's body lay within. Frank felt compelled to revisit the grave, heading toward it through the silent and deserted woods. Each step intensified the eerie sensation. The woods appeared devoid of life except for Frank. As he neared the grave, he noticed fresh marks on the stone, with Denning's name chiseled out and a new name added below. Diamond expressed concern about Frank venturing alone on the island, recalling past incidents. Hans regretted letting Frank go alone, while Browning, usually nonchalant, was anxious due to a recent near-death experience involving Frank. Diamond wanted to search for Frank immediately, but Hodge hesitated, respecting Merry's instructions.|"1. What is the eerie feeling returning to Frank as he ventures through the mysterious island?
