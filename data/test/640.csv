The witch, seeing the Prince return with the horses, barely masked her anger. She fed the Prince and then went to the stables to scold the horses for not hiding well. She ordered them to hide in the clouds the next morning until she called, threatening to beat them if they disobeyed. The following day, after leading the horses to the fields, Iwanich fell into a deep sleep. The horses fled and concealed themselves in the clouds hanging from the mountains. The witch, displeased, instructed the horses to hide in the royal henhouse the next day, promising punishment if they failed. When the horses vanished, the Prince sought help from a fox.
