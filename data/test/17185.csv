Beavers are remarkable creatures known for their instinctual behavior. They exhibit incredible abilities in constructing dams and houses. Their circular huts, resembling haycocks, have multiple entrances for easy access and escape. However, despite their ingenuity, beavers face threats from hunters during winter when their fur is most valuable. Hunters strategically create holes in frozen lakes to capture beavers seeking refuge underwater. While this may seem harsh, it's a practice that has been historically justified as beavers provide valuable resources like fur for humans. One such beaver named Binny, who arrived in 1825, displayed remarkable strength and building skills. Binny would meticulously arrange materials and even prop himself up on his tail to assess his construction. His behavior showcased the intricate adaptation of his hind feet for grooming.

"""It is indeed remarkable, Frank. The interior of the nest is fascinating, with many parts showing human-like ingenuity. One exceptional feature is the two-floor structure with galleries along the walls leading to storage areas and nurseries. The white ants have a unique class of soldiers, one in a hundred, who fiercely defend the nest when under attack. These soldiers have long jaws and can even drive off humans with their bites.

Welcome, students! Tonight, I will share fascinating stories about elephants. These majestic creatures are known for their intelligence, often displaying actions that seem more like reasoned decisions than mere instincts. In the lush forests of Asia, elephants reign supreme with their size and strength, easily overpowering formidable foes. Despite their power, they possess gentle and peaceful natures. In the East Indies, elephants are captured for use as beasts of burden by native hunters who employ clever tactics to deceive and trap them. By forming circles and using drums and rattles to guide the elephants towards enclosures, hunters capture entire herds. The process involves gradually driving the elephants into enclosures through a series of tactics until they are safely secured. Once captured, elephants may initially resist but eventually adapt to their new environment.|"1. What is the main topic of the text passage?

The tiger is a fearsome animal that can cause great harm to people in the areas it inhabits. To protect themselves, villagers in some places have devised clever strategies to hunt tigers. In one method, a strong bamboo cage is built in a tiger's frequented area. A hunter armed with spears and accompanied by a dog or goat spends the night inside the cage. When the tiger approaches and tries to enter the cage, the hunter strikes with a spear, usually killing the tiger. In another method used in India, peasants smear leaves with a sticky substance made from tree berries. When a tiger steps on these leaves, it becomes ensnared, causing great discomfort and enabling the peasants to shoot the trapped animal. Additionally, in South America, hunters use dogs to chase and corner pumas, then strike them with lassos or weapons. These stories illustrate the dangers and ingenuity involved in hunting such formidable predators.|"1. What is one method villagers use to protect themselves from tigers?

In the Pampas of America, the fear wild animals have of humans is evident. Despite efforts to approach ostriches and zamas, they flee upon seeing even a glimpse of a person. This instinctive fear gives humans dominion over animals. A man once encountered a puma while trying to hunt ducks. Crawling under a poncho, the puma stood on him, but recognizing the man's authority, it eventually walked away. Another tale tells of Maldonata, who befriended a sick puma in a cavern. Later, when faced with death by wild beasts, the same puma protected her, earning her pardon.

Many stories of swallows being discovered in unusual places are now known to be myths. These birds migrate like many others. Last fall, I observed a flock preparing for their long journey with joy. They gathered on a nearby tree each evening, resting before one bird, seemingly the leader, took flight with a sharp call. The whole group followed in a spiral pattern, disappearing into the sky. After a short time, they returned to the tree. The Chinese are said to eat swallows' nests, which are not mud as ours, but composed of fine filaments and a sticky substance. These nests are highly valued and harvested from deep caverns. Harvesting them is dangerous, requiring special rituals and prayers for safety. The nests are traded and prized for their delicate texture and color, fetching high prices in China.|"1. What is the main purpose of the passage?

One lovely afternoon, while purchasing milk near a river, I was amazed by a loud roar and sudden darkness. It turned out to be a massive flock of pigeons flying low over the mountains. Similarly, land crabs in the Bahamas march from the mountains to the coast to lay their eggs. They move in battalions, with strong males leading, followed by females in columns extending for miles. A rear guard of weaker crabs closes the march. The journey is slow, taking months. The crabs need moisture to survive, marching mostly at night. If it rains, they halt. When they reach the coast, they cast their spawn into the sea. The spawn matures and returns to the mountains as millions of tiny crabs. The natives eagerly await their return, capturing them for their delicious meat once they are fat and flavorful.|"1. What amazed the speaker while purchasing milk near a river?

Uncle Thomas explained to Frank about the migratory instinct of fishes, particularly the salmon, as they journey from the sea to rivers against strong currents and waterfalls. He mentioned how these instincts are gifts from their Creator. John then shared details from Pennant's work about the yearly migration of herrings, where they divide into groups heading to the Scottish and British coasts, Yarmouth, the British Channel, and the Hebrides. However, Uncle Thomas pointed out that some information might not be entirely accurate, as herrings likely stay near the shores and return each season. He also recounted stories about baboons in Africa, known for raiding gardens and orchards in groups, with sentinels warning of danger. Le Vaillant's baboon, Kees, was praised for his protective instincts and ability to detect threats, even safeguarding against harmful fruits.|"1.

Uncle Thomas explained to Frank about the migratory instinct of fishes, particularly the salmon, as they journey from the sea to rivers against strong currents and waterfalls. He mentioned how these instincts are gifts from their Creator. John then shared details from Pennant's work about the yearly migration of herrings, where they divide into groups heading to the Scottish and British coasts, Yarmouth, the British Channel, and the Hebrides.

Kees was always the first to wake in the morning. When it was time, he roused the dogs with ease, as they were used to his commands. The dogs obeyed him promptly, taking their positions around the tent and carriage as directed. Some monkeys are lively and restless, while others are quiet and moody. The fair monkey, despite its beauty, turned cruel towards its mate. It pretended kindness before pushing her into the sea. Monkeys can be kind too, especially towards their young, protecting them from harm. Some monkeys from the Americas have prehensile tails, allowing them to move swiftly among trees. When a female monkey was killed, her young clung to her body, mistaking a wig for its mother. The young monkey eventually freed itself after mistaking the wig for its mother for weeks. It became a beloved pet until it devoured a collection of insects, accidentally swallowing pins and meeting its demise. Animals, like humans, show affection and care for their young. Domestic hens are fiercely protective of their chicks, showcasing a mother's love and bravery even in the face of danger.|"1. What is Kees known for in the morning?
