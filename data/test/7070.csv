The mysterious disappearance of a significant part of the Inca treasure remains unsolved. The Spaniards, by torturing the locals who knew the secret, uncovered a few findings. However, these discoveries were likely just a fraction of the total missing wealth. Legends suggest that the Peruvians fled with a substantial amount of treasure towards the east of Peru, where they may have established a hidden city. The dense forests and hostile tribes in the region have prevented any exploration. The story transitions to two men in a London club discussing their predicaments. One, Prendergast, is a former navy officer seeking adventure and fortune to win the hand of his beloved, Miss Fortescue. The other man, experienced in the Mediterranean, advises Prendergast to consider South America, particularly Peru, where hidden treasures may lie waiting to be discovered.|"1.

Their night was far from enjoyable. The beds were basic, just hides on wooden frames, and they quickly discovered they were not alone. With little sleep, they eagerly welcomed the first light of day.

The journey was six miles uphill, with a rough road and dry surroundings. Approaching the town, they encountered lush vegetation and canals irrigating the land. Inside Lima, the streets were orderly, with houses painted in squares or stripes, featuring enclosed balconies. The hotel they checked into was grand but lacked cleanliness. Despite the unexpected chilly mist in Lima, they prepared with ponchos made from guanaco wool for their mountain travels.|"1. What did the characters discover about their beds?

In the search for hidden treasures and gold mines, the mountains hold the key. Stories suggest that treasures were hidden along the eastern Cordilleras range and beyond.

"""Hello, Bertie, I mostly agree with you. If I came here to study Inca history and explore their palace ruins, I'd be happy to stay longer. But like you, I'm eager to keep moving. Dias mentioned we can start again in two days. We've been planning how much flour and supplies we need. The mules should carry as little as possible to cross the Inca roads. Dias suggested using llamas instead, as they're great climbers. We might take a few llamas with us to set up a central camp. They can carry fifty pounds each. We debated taking the Paucartambo pass, but it's dangerous. Food won't be an issue; we can find wild turkeys and abandoned plantations along the way. The Chincas tribe might pose a threat on this path. Alternatively, the Tinta mountain route is perilous. We set off with four llamas added to our group. They'll follow the mules easily.

Understanding the bandits' tactics, I was certain the paper I saw their leader holding was a letter forced from you to demand money for your release.

The ancient tunnel had two rooms above it that spanned the house's width, unlike the rooms below which were narrower due to the rock walls on either side. The tunnel was wide at twelve feet, with walls about three feet thick. The construction lacked bricks or cut stones, using longer stones that projected over each other, forming a stable structure. Inside, a sunken tank with water was found, likely fed by a pipe from outside. The rooms alongside the tunnel were thought to be used as prisons, with the upper rooms serving as living quarters. The strategic design made it difficult for enemies to access, ensuring a secure water supply and defense. The searchers found bones in the chambers, carefully collecting them in leather bags to carry out of the ancient site for further examination.|"1. What was the width of the ancient tunnel?

Harry mentioned that they would bury the bodies when they moved camp the next morning. He acknowledged they forgot two bodies at a window but decided they could dispose of them the following day. The group returned to the castle in silence, feeling the gloom and emptiness of the hall. Donna Maria, usually talkative, was still shaken by the bats' sudden departure. After a meal, their spirits lifted. José awaited them with a warm fire and was briefed on their findings. He speculated that the castle might have been a fortress or prison pre-Incas, later used by the Incas. The group discussed the possibility of hidden treasure, speculating on a lost ship carrying riches. Despite successful searches, they pondered the challenges of finding treasure, especially in the lower chambers near water levels. José questioned how the ancient people could have constructed chambers below the riverbed, considering the challenges of excavating solid rock.|"1.

"Dias nodded seriously. He had been with travelers who had done a lot of digging, and he could grasp Harry's point. Maria, who was listening attentively, also understood.

At the end with the cistern, the basement floor is only a few inches above the passage's bottom; thus, at the other end, it must be twelve feet above the water level."" ""You're right, Bertie!""

José skillfully crafted a sturdy support for Maria's cooking pots by securing a sapling to an upright beam. This ingenious setup allowed Maria to adjust the height of her pots above the fire. As they settled in for the night, Harry suggested hanging blankets to keep out bats. They waited until dusk when a silent stream of bats exited the cave.

José skillfully crafted a sturdy support for Maria's cooking pots by securing a sapling to an upright beam. This ingenious setup allowed Maria to adjust the height of her pots above the fire. As they settled in for the night, Harry suggested hanging blankets to keep out bats. They waited until dusk when a silent stream of bats exited the cave. After the bats departed, the blankets were hung to prevent their return. The brothers discussed the possibility of eating bats if food became scarce, comparing them to other unconventional meals like monkeys and rats. As dawn approached, the bats returned, only to be deterred by the closed entrance. The brothers watched as the bats circled outside before eventually flying away.

It is likely that the ancient builders did not have the tools to cut hard stones like this one easily. They might have used a saw without teeth and kept the stone wet with sand to slowly cut through it. Another method could have been driving dry wedges into the cut and then moistening them to create a straight edge. The effort put into making such a smooth floor indicates a strong motive behind it. The stones found were of varying sizes but fit closely together. Removing them will be challenging, especially near the rock wall. Careful planning is needed to avoid scattering the stones and ensure a successful explosion if needed. Despite the challenges, the work ahead is not without its risks, particularly with the presence of dangerous animals like pumas or jaguars in the vicinity.|"1. What method might the ancient builders have used to cut hard stones like the one mentioned in the passage?
