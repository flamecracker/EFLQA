Wulf's estate extended to the sea, stretching eight miles wide and twelve miles back from Steyning. In times of conflict, he could raise over three hundred men. Neighboring thanes visited upon Wulf's return to Steyning, but he found their rough ways and revelry unappealing. The prior of Bramber Monastery, a friend of Wulf's family, visited often. The prior, at Earl Harold's request, aimed to guide Wulf in his studies and prevent him from adopting the Saxon drinking habits. The prior, well-educated and cultured, shared tales of history and art with Wulf. Wulf, in turn, often visited the monastery, where he explored rare manuscripts and observed the monks' illuminating work.

She was almost at the shore when a loud crash startled her, followed by a massive wave that lifted the ship. Wulf saw a black rock wall rushing past, almost touching the ship. The vessel struck again, causing chaos on deck. The mast fell, and another powerful hit left the ship stuck. Waves carried everyone overboard, some managing to reach the sandy shore while others were pulled back by the receding water. In the chaos, Wulf found himself in the water, but Osgod kept him afloat. Earl Harold, standing in the water, rescued them both, urging them to stay still and helping them to safety. After the waves settled, Harold organized the survivors to form lines and rescue others from the surf. Despite injuries, they managed to save many. Harold then prepared litters for the wounded, and the group set off. Harold, anticipating trouble, instructed his companions to hide their valuables to avoid attracting unwanted attention. Wulf noticed a fisherman recognizing Harold, raising concerns about their safety. Harold acknowledged the risk but remained determined to protect his men.|"1. What caused chaos on deck?

Wulf learned about this from the prior of Bramber, who warned that trouble could arise in England upon Edward's death. Despite the promise, William had been loyal to the duke and helped destroy castles in Normandy to prevent civil strife. Wulf and Beorn were impressed by the horses provided for their ride to De Burg's castle, where they found few remaining castles due to the duke's policy.

The land north of the Humber had long been free, with its own rulers, not loyal to the kings of the West Saxons.

"Do not worry, you are likely to arrive first. We may have already passed the other vessels. The wind was calmer yesterday, so they probably anchored when the tide changed. If their captain knows the area well, they might have continued when the tide turned, but they likely anchored before reaching Sheerness. If so, we passed them a few hours ago. We often outpace ships that set off with us by days. Most ships go outside the sands in good weather, but we stay inside where the tides are gentler. We only sail in clear weather or steady winds, always checking the water depth with a lead-line. If we get stuck, we anchor, lower the sail, and rest until the tide rises.

Ulred, you acted correctly, and I sincerely thank you in the name of the king and myself. However, we lack evidence that Fitz-Urse is plotting against the king's life. It was unfortunate that Ulf couldn't understand the initial conversation he overheard, but I should have anticipated that any discussions Fitz-Urse had with others would be in Norman. I cannot believe I overlooked this possibility. While Fitz-Urse has learned our language during his time here, he would likely converse with Normans regarding this matter. I'll ponder the situation overnight before deciding our next steps. The king is safe within the bishop's palace, and Normans are unlikely to arrive for at least a day. We must determine the number of men involved. The armorers are unaware of this, but it's possible they were concealed on the ship. We've agreed not to inform the king yet, as he has enough on his plate. We'll keep a close eye on the situation to prevent any surprises.|"1.

The marriage had not made Harold happy, but the people sympathized with his sacrifice for the country.

The hills rose steeply on the sides, forming a sort of peninsula where Harold's troops prepared for battle. The royal standard was raised as trees were felled to create a defensive palisade. Harold relied on his housecarls, well-trained warriors, over the undisciplined levies. As the night fell, a messenger arrived from William, challenging Harold to single combat for the crown. Harold refused, knowing the battle's outcome would not be determined in such a manner. Contrary to Norman claims, the English army did not spend the night feasting but rested after days of hard labor. Harold, a deeply religious and merciful man, prepared for the battle with prayer. In contrast, William of Normandy was known for his merciless tactics in warfare. Despite their equal abilities, Harold's nobility of character set him apart from William.
