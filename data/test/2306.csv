One time, in a far-off land, before any of us were born, the animals and creatures gathered among themselves for an assembly. In those days, the animals had a lot of sense, just like people. They decided to hold an assembly to sort out issues and hear complaints. The Lion, being the king, was present along with other creatures like the Rhinoceros, Elephant, Camels, and even the Crawfishes. They spoke, argued, cursed, and conducted their affairs. During a dispute, the Elephant accidentally stepped on a Crawfish, squashing it. This angered the other Crawfishes, who tried to voice their concerns, but amidst all the chaos, their voices were drowned out. Eventually, the Crawfishes burrowed underground, causing water to gush out, flooding the land and drowning all the creatures.

The time is now, and this is the place - Let the sun of salvation shine directly on your face; Fight the battles of the Lord, fight soon and fight late, and you'll always find a latch to the golden gate. There's no need to wait until tomorrow, the sun mustn't set on your sorrow - Sin is as sharp as a bamboo brier, Ask the Lord to bring you up higher!|"6.
