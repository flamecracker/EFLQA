"""The lives of people are busy,"" said the Demon, ""they need to move around a lot. But the machines they have like trolleys, cars, and trains are slow and often break. Men haven't realized that the air can be a fast way to travel, like birds do. There are forces in nature that can help with this. One force is gravity, which pulls things down. Another force, repulsion, can push things up. Then there are the Polar electric forces that attract things to the poles. Opposing these is centrifugal electric force, pulling things from east to west. These forces are available for people to use, if they know how. The Demon showed a small machine that can be attached to the wrist to control these forces for flying. He gave the boy this machine to use for a week. The Demon promised to return with more gifts next week."""|"6. How do you think the boy felt about receiving the small machine from the Demon?
