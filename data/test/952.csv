Slowly adjusting the weights with compound levers, Tom leveled the glider. He then aligned it parallel to the wind so that the air could flow through the wings. It was a delicate operation, as Tom wasn't experienced in this type of flying. Despite some forward motion due to imperfections, the air glider remained nearly still compared to the powerful wind. Tom made adjustments, making the glider soar and dip like a bird. With further trials and adjustments, the glider performed better.

Tom had the option of two paths for his journey to far-off Siberia. He could have chosen to cross the United States, sail over the Pacific Ocean, and approach Siberia from the western coast above Manchuria. Instead, he decided on the Atlantic route, crossing Europe and sailing over Russia to reach his destination. The Atlantic route was shorter, offering more ships for assistance in case of emergencies. Tom's decision was also influenced by the quality of gasolene in France, which would eliminate the need to refuel in Russia. With Ned and Mr. Petrofsky in agreement, they set off on their airship, the Falcon, equipped with supplies and a wonderful air glider.

The Russian expressed concern that spies might have alerted Russia about their journey from Shopton. Tom needed parts for the dynamo and magneto, intending to visit a large city like Paris. The airship's progress towards France depended on the wind, which was favorable. Tom tried to fix the broken machinery but struggled. As they used more gas to ascend, Tom aimed to remain unnoticed by flying higher. Landing near a village, Tom set off for Paris to find the necessary parts. Despite language barriers, he navigated Paris and located a machine shop discreetly. Mr. Petrofsky was relieved that their presence hadn't caused a commotion. Tom, Ned, Mr. Damon, and the Russian worked tirelessly to repair the airship. While working outside, Tom noticed a man observing him closely.
