E) Youth's beliefs"|A) Youth's self-absorption|Yes
"""We often believe that today's youth is not as good as when we were young,"" Mr. Hardy remarked. ""This is a common human tendency. But Master McLean has a unique perspective. With forty years of experience guiding young people, he surely has insights. What do you think, Alexander?"" 

""Youth is youth,"" the schoolmaster responded thoughtfully. ""I mean exactly that. I believe it remains consistent across generations. The youth of today resembles that of ancient Babylon. In my classroom, I see similarities between this year's youth and that of ten, twenty, or even forty years ago.""

""Generally, I see it as self-centeredness. Youth's world revolves around itself, not looking beyond,"" he continued. ""We adults exist to serve youth. We are secondary to the main fact, which is youth itself."" 

""It's a timeless truth,"" the schoolmaster added. ""This self-absorption defines youth, giving it charm and simplicity. I wouldn't change it if I could, as it adds to youth's appeal.""

""Age is a mindset,"" Mr. Hervey chimed in. ""Beliefs vary at different ages, and each age considers its beliefs true. We can't judge the wisdom of different ages by the same standards. I agree with Mr. McLean that youth's character shouldn't be altered. Looking back at my youth, I find humor in it, but back then, it was real and valid.""

A faint light seeped through an uncovered window into the room. Robert intended to wait for Tayoga but halted at the doorway, struck by a surprising sight.

I've been twice a prisoner of the French, and my presence here is proof that I escaped both times. When I tire of your society and that of the captain, I'll leave you.""

The boat leaned to the side, missing its sails and spars, held in place by sand and rocks. Robert, driven by curiosity, boarded it, carefully navigating the slanted, slippery deck. Discovering a potential treasure trove, he scavenged the captain's and mates' cabins for supplies, hauling them to the beach.

Working tirelessly until midnight, he transported his findings ashore, securing them under a tarpaulin. Using a dinghy found on the ship, he ferried his precious cargo to his house across the island, making multiple trips. Reluctant to abandon the vessel completely, he continued to strip it of valuable tools, weapons, clothing, and ammunition, leaving behind items that could be useful in emergencies.|"1.

Fishing brought some enjoyment to Robert on the island. He used the ship's supplies to catch fish in the large lake and tried deep-sea fishing from a dinghy, but the big fish bit too quickly to hold his interest.

He considered lighting a bonfire for rescue but feared attracting pirates common in the area. Despite the pleasant weather, Robert remained cautious, opting to swim within the reefs after spotting a fin in the water. One day, he mistook a cloud for a sail, signaling an approaching storm, prompting him to seek shelter in the house.|"1. What did Robert use to catch fish on the island?

Robert managed to secure the door just before a fierce storm hit. The powerful winds and rain lashed against the sturdy house, causing it to tremble and shake, but it held its ground. Despite the howling storm outside, Robert found solace in watching the chaos from a small window on the eastern side of the house.

"""Montcalm and his troops made extensive preparations to defend against General Wolfe,"" Charteris explained. ""I was in Quebec at that time and witnessed their efforts. They constructed earthworks, bastions, and redoubts from Quebec to Montcalm's camp at Beauport. Montcalm's headquarters were initially in a large stone house at Beauport.

The city gates were fortified except for the Palace Gate. They had over a hundred cannons on the walls, a floating battery with twelve guns, gun-boats, and fire ships. About fifteen thousand men were at Beauport, along with militia and Indians. De Ramesay commanded two thousand in the city, making their force nearly twenty thousand, double ours.
