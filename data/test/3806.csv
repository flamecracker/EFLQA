Wrapping up a butterfly would almost kill it; the worms might get lost in the bedclothes; and the toads would likely fall out first thing.""""I think they will understand that it's a hospital, and be too kind to harm or scare their neighbors,"" started Nelly; but as she spoke, a chubby white dove strolled in, glanced around with its red-ringed eyes, and calmly pecked up a tiny bug that had just come out from the crack where it had hidden when the rain came.""Yes, we need the nets. I'll ask mom for some lace,"" said Nelly, observing that; and, carrying her pet dove on her shoulder, she explained about her hospital as she headed towards the house; for, loving all little creatures as she did, it saddened her to see any harm come to even the smallest or plainest of them. She had a lovely childlike belief that her playmates understood her language as she did theirs, and that birds, flowers, animals, and insects felt for her the same affection she felt for them. Love always creates friendships, and nothing seemed to fear the gentle child; but welcomed her like a little sun that shone equally on all, and never experienced an eclipse."|"4.
