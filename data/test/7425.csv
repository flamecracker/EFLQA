"Every so often, a gentle, rushing sound piqued Johnny's interest so much that he once limped painfully up the courtyard to peer into the trees. On one occasion, he caught glimpses of a small creature, adorned in blue, white, and gold, who peeked out from the green foliage, nodding and attempting to offer him a cluster of chestnut flowers. Overwhelmed with joy, Johnny reached out to her, forgetting his crutches, and almost stumbled if he hadn't gripped a window shutter quickly, straining his back. When he looked up again, the fairy had disappeared, leaving only dancing leaves in the wind. ""How I wish I could peek in and see how it truly looks! It sounds and smells so summery and nice in there,"" thought Johnny. Laughing at himself, he spoke to the white cat, who purred in response. Unable to describe the beauty below, Johnny returned to his picture. Enthused by the thought of emulating Monte Cristo, Johnny began chipping away at a loose brick with an old pair of scissors, eager to take a peek. After successfully creating a hole, he hesitated, then leaned forward to catch a glimpse of the enchanting scene beyond. He saw a bed of tulips, a colorful bird, a sleeping Princess, and more, feeling like he was peering into a fairy-tale world."|"1. What piqued Johnny's interest in the courtyard?
