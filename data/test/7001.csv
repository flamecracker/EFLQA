The decision to embark on an expedition to Camboja faced opposition due to the concerns of many in the city. The majority believed it unwise as it would deplete the city of men and the success of the mission was uncertain. Reports indicated that Camboja was under the rule of the king of Sian with a significant military presence. Proceeding with the expedition risked turning the king of Sian into an enemy, despite recent friendly gestures towards the city. Lieutenant-general Don Antonio de Morga and others advised against the expedition, but Don Luys, influenced by the support of the religious order, remained determined. The fleet encountered a storm, splitting the group. While some reached Camboja, tensions arose with the Chinese, leading to a violent confrontation. An attempt to negotiate with the local ruler failed, resulting in a daring but risky escape by the Spaniards back to their ships, evading pursuit. Captain Gallinato, upon his return, chose to abandon the mission and head back to Manila, rejecting further engagement with the region.|"1.

The journey led by Admiral Corneille Matelief from 1605 to 1608 was notable for its operations in Malacca, the Moluccas, and China. The fleet, comprising eleven ships and over a thousand men, faced challenges due to the unruly behavior of the crew, leading to insubordination throughout the voyage. The expedition encountered resistance from locals in various regions, with duplicity and treachery complicating interactions with the Dutch. Despite setbacks in Malacca and encounters with the Portuguese, the Dutch engaged in negotiations and skirmishes while striving to establish trade relations. Upon returning to Holland in 1608, Admiral Matelief emphasized the strategic importance of the East Indies due to ongoing conflicts with powerful adversaries like the Spanish and Portuguese. His reflections underscored the need for sustained Dutch presence in the region to counter the established colonial powers effectively.|"6.

If we want to establish ourselves well in the Indias, we need a station where we can be welcomed upon arrival from Holland. This would lead to great profits. Having refreshments ready for our crews and vessels would boost our reputation with Indian princes. The natives view the Dutch favorably but prefer trading with the Portuguese for protection. We need to show the Indians that we have the means and desire to settle among them. The trade in the Indias focuses on pepper from various places, cloves from Amboina and the Moluccas, nutmeg and mace from Banda, Cambaie, the Coromandel coast, and the Chinese and Japanese coasts. To avoid conflict and keep prices stable, it's important for one nation to manage each trade. While we share pepper trade with the English, we can control other spices to secure our profits.|"1.

In my view, we can attract the trade of nutmegs and mace without the need to capture Banda and construct a fort there, which would be costly and harm our reputation among Indian rulers. Instead, I propose making a treaty with the powerful king of Macassar, who supplies rice and food to Malacca and Banda. By sending the king three ships with 200 men, we can join forces with the Macassar troops to take over Banda. We would promise the king exclusive trading rights in Banda, only allowing our nation to trade there at a fixed price. This plan is likely to be accepted by the king of Macassar, who may even agree to build a trading post for us. To control the clove trade, we must remove the Spaniards from Ternate. This can be achieved by disrupting their supply route from the Manilles through a strategic attack on Panama or Panati. By eliminating Spanish vessels in the Manilles, we can cut off supplies to Ternate, leading to their downfall. Additionally, seizing a galley in Ternate would further weaken the Spanish position. To safeguard our commerce in cotton fabrics at Coromandel, capturing Malacca from the Portuguese is crucial as they could disrupt our trade routes. If we fail to besiege Malacca again, the Portuguese could use their fustas to obstruct our trade with Coromandel, posing a significant threat to our operations.|"1.

Delgado, in his book from 1892, talks about the wild amaranths called quiletes, also known as haroma by the natives. These plants are all edible. Pingré's translation of the Descubrimiento de las Islas de Salomon mentions a total eclipse of the moon on the 17th of October. Mendaña, in his will, named his wife Doña Isabella de Barreto as the lady governor of the fleet. The text also discusses a frigate found wrecked with the crew dead, and the crew of a galliot landing on an islet in Mindanao. The soldiers from the galliot were sent as prisoners to Manila. Lord Stanley translates a passage about devout fraternities and missionaries. The Spanish word dojicos is related to the French term dogiques, referring to natives who instruct their countrymen in the absence of priests. Santa Ines offers a slightly different translation of the same sentence, dated to the first year of Quercho. J.J. Rein publishes yet another version regarding the persecution of people from the Philippine Islands in Japan.|"1. What wild plants are discussed in Delgado's book from 1892?

In the British Museum, a manuscript called Dutch Memorable Embassies mentions a regent named Ongoschio who died on September 16, 1598, at the age of sixty-four after ruling for fifteen years. Japanese society was divided into five classes in the Recueil des voyages, with a battle fought at Sekigahara in October 1600, where firearms and cannons were used alongside spears and swords. The count of Essex captured the city of Cadiz in 1596, leaving it in ruins. Juan Francisco Valdés and Juan Gutiérrez were notable figures during this time. The governor's execution of rebels without trial or the intervention of the Audiencia was likely due to the lack of recognition of Holland's independence by Spain. This led to strained relations and seclusion by Japan.|"1. What event occurred in October 1600 at Sekigahara according to the text?

Argensola recounted a tragic event where many peaceful Chinese merchants were killed in the parián, while others took their own lives. General Hontay and the rich Chican were among the victims because of their refusal to support Eng-Kang. The alcalde of Pampanga sent 4,000 armed Pampangos to aid Manila during the turmoil. Cruelties were rampant, with Spaniards and natives hunting down the Chinese at the orders of Don Pedro de Acuña and Hernando de Avalos. The arrival of the Spaniards in the Philippines, along with Chinese immigration, led to the downfall of local industries and agriculture due to fierce competition. The deep-rooted animosity between Filipinos and Chinese has sparked legislative actions. Despite the historical significance of the Chinese question in the Philippines, the Chinese have persisted in their trade and occupations in the islands.|"1.

In the past, the Bagacay was a weapon used by the Moro people. It was a small, sharp reed hardened in fire, thrown with great accuracy at enemies. The soldiers, after entering a city, resorted to violence and pillaging, sparing no one, not even children or young girls. The consequences of such actions led to hostility towards the Spanish name, making it as odious as the Portuguese. The unfortunate king, exiled by the Jesuit Father Luis Fernández, suffered greatly, even being left to starve by Don Juan de Silva's administration. The king was described as having robust proportions, a cloud-colored complexion, and European-like facial features. His fierce appearance was accentuated by his campilan, dagger, and kris with gilded serpent heads. The Japanese settled in Dilao mutinied after a Japanese man was killed by a Spaniard. The poisoning of some individuals, believed to be instigated by the governor's envious enemies, caused further unrest.|"1. What was the Bagacay used for by the Moro people in the past?

Colin, in his book Labor Evangelica from Madrid in 1663, discusses the naming of the Philippines. He mentions Ptolemy's reference to the Maniolas islands, which some believe led to the name Manilas for the islands. However, Spanish writers, like James A. LeRoy in a letter from March 14, 1904, spent more time on this question than necessary. LeRoy suggests that old Chinese and Japanese documents likely contain information about the Philippines before the Spanish arrival. The exact location of the island of Tendaya, also known as Isla Filipina, remains unclear. Different sources place it in Panay, Leyte, or Samar. The traditions indicate that the Filipino Indians originated from Sumatra, but much of this historical knowledge was lost due to religious efforts to erase pagan records. For more on the ethnology of the Philippines, refer to Professor Blumentritt's work, Versuch einer Etnographie der Philippinen from 1882.|"1.

LeRoy suggests that old Chinese and Japanese documents likely contain information about the Philippines before the Spanish arrival. The exact location of the island of Tendaya, also known as Isla Filipina, remains unclear. Different sources place it in Panay, Leyte, or Samar. The traditions indicate that the Filipino Indians originated from Sumatra, but much of this historical knowledge was lost due to religious efforts to erase pagan records.

Pilê, a fruit from the Canarium commune tree, was highly valued for its usefulness in the islands. It grew in mountainous areas and was harvested by locals who extracted a white pitch from the tree. The fruit had a tough shell and tasted like a large almond. The tree itself was tall, straight, and had broad leaves. Another tree, the Cedrela toona or calanta in Tagál and lanipga in Visayan, had fragrant wood used for ship hulls due to its strength and lightness. The asana tree, also known as Pterocarpus indicus or naga in Visayas, had male and female varieties with pinkish and white wood, respectively. These trees were used for large timber work and had medicinal properties when in contact with water.|"1. What is the main use of the Pilê fruit from the Canarium commune tree?

In the past, Mindoro faced a decline in population and agriculture due to various reasons. Gaspar de San Agustin mentioned how the insurrection and the cutting of timber for shipbuilding led to a decrease in population. The town of Guagua, once rich with chiefs and abundant harvests, now lies submerged under the sea. The minister of the Colonies proposed sending criminals to repopulate the island. Colin noted that tattooing was a common practice among different tribes in the Philippines, while the Negritos and Igorrotes still continue this tradition. The Filipinos used black ink for tattooing, unlike the Japanese who used various colors. The arrival of the Spaniards caused a decline in the population of Panay, with many giving up gold mining due to mistreatment by the authorities. The Filipino people had a rich culture before Spanish colonization, as evidenced by their writing systems and customs.|"1.

To obtain fiber from the plant, the fruit is initially cut so that the leaves grow long and wide. Once developed, the leaves are removed, scraped to extract the fiber, washed, sun-dried, combed, and sorted into four grades based on quality. The resulting cloth is known for its softness and delicacy. The fruit, called Xi-cu by Chinese traders, is a scarlet fruit with a yellow variety as well. The fruit resembles an acorn but is the size of a lemon with a soft peel and honey-like interior. The tree is broad but not very tall, with small round leaves.

Agave, also known as pita in the Philippines, was used to make nipis, a native textile in Visayas. The term pita referred to braids or ornaments made from agave fibers. Imposts and restrictions still in place in 1890 forced the search for foreign markets as the local ones offered limited advantages. A document from 1640 mentioned that this trade brought the government 350,000 pesos yearly. Laws outlined the governor's and Audiencia's power in authorizing conquests by private individuals. The revenue from gold mines and jewels was substituted with imposts on property and industry.
