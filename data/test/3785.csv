Marie, you are too pessimistic. Death might separate lovers, but there's no need to fear it more now than before. Some disagreeable individuals have been harmed, but that shouldn't concern us. The nobles have been calling for reforms and willingly gave up their privileges. There's no reason for animosity towards us. My mother and the marquis want us to join them in Paris. They worry about us being alone in this uncertain time. My father is upset about the nobles fleeing the country, believing they're abandoning their responsibilities and causing suspicion towards the entire class. A week later, we left for Paris in three carriages, eager for a change. The marquis was deeply involved in the events unfolding, hosting gatherings with nobles and political figures. The atmosphere was a mix of lighthearted conversations, serious discussions, and indifference. The marquis engaged with everyone, from courtiers to politicians, trying to uplift Marie's spirits. By the end of July, tension rose as the situation in Paris became more precarious. Troops were leaving the city, leaving the royal family vulnerable. The marquis sensed danger as the National Guard's loyalty wavered. On the eve of August 10th, the tocsin rang, signaling imminent peril. Despite the king's reassurances, the marquis readied himself to defend the palace, leaving his family behind.|"1. What is the main reason for the marquis' concern on the eve of August 10th?

I don't have any connections to secure such a position, and they wouldn't hire someone my age without extraordinary influence. Another thought was to reveal I'm English to get arrested and end up in the same prison to help her escape. But that's too uncertain. The best option might be to bribe some guards cautiously. It's risky, but we must plan carefully. There's no immediate danger, so we have time to strategize. Have you considered any ideas?"" Harry inquired.

""I've pondered various options since this morning, Harry, but like yours, they seem like impractical plans when I think them through. I'm not sure if they allow people inside the prisons to sell items to the inmates. If they did, I could try to enter with something and see Marie, figuring out a way to get her out,"" Jeanne replied.
