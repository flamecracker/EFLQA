They lead the cows back home from the fields, Along the shady path, Where the quail sings loudly in the wheat-fields, Yellow with ripe grain. They discover the scarlet-lipped strawberries, Hidden in the tall grass, And collect the earliest snowdrops, Along with the first crimson rosebuds. They toss fresh hay in the meadow, And gather elderflowers, They find the dusky grapes ripening In the soft October light. They know where the ripest apples hang, Sweeter than Italy's wines; They're aware of the thickest fruit On the long, thorny blackberry vines. They collect delicate sea-weeds, Build small sandcastles, And pick up beautiful seashells, Drifted fairy boats. They wave from the tall tree-tops, Where the oriole's nest swings, And at night, they sleep soundly To the tune of a mother's lullaby. Those who work hard become the strongest; The humble and poor rise to greatness; From these brown-handed children Will emerge powerful leaders of the state. The pen of the author and statesman, The noble and wise of the land, The sword, chisel, and palette, Shall be held in the hands of these little ones.|"1. What do the children do along the shady path?

Snow sifts down on mountains, pines groaning, while I rest on my airy nest under the calm moon. I bind the sun's throne and the moon's with a girdle of pearl, creating a whirlwind banner unfurled.

Daughter of earth and water, nurtured by the sky, I pass through the ocean's pores, changing but never dying. After the rain, when the sky clears, I emerge from the caverns of rain, laughing as I rebuild once more. Joy fills the air in June, as perfect days arrive, with life murmuring and glistening all around. The high-tide of the year floods back what life had ebbed away, bringing happiness as leaves turn green and blossoms swell.

The stars in the midnight sky witness a magnificent sight, as the earth glows with joy on this Christmas night. Showers quench the thirst of flowers, casting light shade on leaves as they dream. The dew from wings awakens buds, cradled by their mother under the sun. Hail lashes the plains, then dissolves into rain, thunder laughing as it passes by. Snow sifts down on mountains, pines groaning, while I rest on my airy nest under the calm moon. I bind the sun's throne and the moon's with a girdle of pearl, creating a whirlwind banner unfurled. From cape to cape, a bridge-like shape hangs over the sea, as I march through with hurricane, fire, and snow under my million-colored bow. Daughter of earth and water, nurtured by the sky, I pass through the ocean's pores, changing but never dying. After the rain, when the sky clears, I emerge from the caverns of rain, laughing as I rebuild once more. Joy fills the air in June, as perfect days arrive, with life murmuring and glistening all around. The high-tide of the year floods back what life had ebbed away, bringing happiness as leaves turn green and blossoms swell. We sit in the warm shade, feeling the sap creep up and the breeze whispering the good news of the season. Everything is happy now, striving upwards, the heart as true as grass is green and|"5.
