Dick, feeling less confident after the gallop, was weighed down by Jackson's formidable reputation and the outnumbered Union troops at Cedar Run. The Confederate leader likely had triple the soldiers. Would the Union forces face defeat if separated into smaller armies? With Pope leading at least fifty thousand men, the situation seemed grim. As they rested, the Union army formed along the creek. Although Dick's colonel hadn't assigned any duties yet, Warner and Pennington were preparing for battle. The skirmishers' intense activity hinted at the impending fight. From the hillock, Dick saw the Southern troops emerging from the woods, led by the renowned Jackson. Despite the fear, Dick and his comrades, victorious in the west, vowed not to fail.

The infantry stood ready for the impending battle.|"1. What was Dick feeling after the gallop?

Despite Dick's reluctance to fight without orders, they agreed on the necessity of retreating. Lee and Jackson's strategic maneuvers had caught them off guard, causing confusion and leaving gaps in their defenses. The enemy's ability to keep them in the dark had led to unexpected attacks and losses. However, Dick remained optimistic about their ultimate victory, despite the challenges posed by Lee and Jackson. Meanwhile, news of Jackson's movements and the Southern army's advances added to the tension. As Pope's army prepared to retreat in the face of mounting pressure, skirmishes and battles erupted, with General Kearney falling in a fierce but inconclusive encounter. Dick, though not directly involved in the fighting, witnessed the aftermath and reflected on the resilience needed to overcome defeat, drawing parallels to historical examples like the Romans. Amidst the chaos, Sergeant Whitley's unscathed presence served as a reminder of the enduring spirit and determination in the face of adversity.|"5.

The retreat continued until they reached the Potomac and were in the great fortifications before Washington. Then Pope resigned, and the star of McClellan rose again. The command of the armies about Washington was entrusted to him, and the North gathered itself anew for the mighty struggle. When the Union army, defeated at the Second Manassas fell back on Washington, Dick was detached for a few days from the regiment by Colonel Winchester, partly that he might have a day or two of leave, and partly that he might watch over Warner, who was making good progress. Warner was in a wagon that contained half a dozen other wounded boys, all silent like stoics as they passed over the bridge to a hospital in Washington. His side and shoulder pained him, and he had recurrent periods of fever, but he was making fine progress. George's cot was near a window, and the pleasant sunshine poured in. Dick left George, saying he would come back the next day. The streets of Washington were full of sunshine, but not of hope and cheerfulness. The most terrible suspense reigned there. Never before or since was Washington in such alarm. A hostile and victorious army was within a day's march. The people were dropped from the golden clouds of hope to the hard earth of despair. They strained their eyes toward Manassas, where the flag of the Union had twice gone down in disaster. But Dick believed none of these rumors. He was sure that McClellan|"1.

Far ahead, behind the hills, the low grumble of cannons could be heard. Even further to the west, the same ominous sound echoed. The Confederates, spread out widely, were alert despite the imminent danger posed by Orders No. 191, which could lead to their complete destruction.

As McClellan set out on his delayed march, he found himself closer to Lee than Jackson, with the odds seemingly in his favor. However, lightning-fast perception and unwavering courage were the qualities that would determine the outcome of this crucial moment. The boys listened as the distant rumble of cannons grew louder, evolving into a distant thunder. Smoke and flashes of fire could be seen ahead, where high forested hills stood. A young Maryland cavalry officer nearby explained that the source of the cannon fire was a gap in South Mountain, although it remained hidden from view by the dense forest.|"1.

The feeling of failure spread through the entire army, even the privates openly discussed it. The two precious days lost before the battle of Antietam remained unforgettable.

His uncle, deeply moved, embraced him warmly, grateful for his unexpected visit. The colonel shared his worry about not hearing from Harry since spring, despite risking much to seek news. The town was deserted, with many fleeing due to the nearby armies and guerillas.

I have not only heard but also seen and conversed with him. Our encounter happened after the Second Manassas battle when we were both part of burial details on the field. Although I was present at Antietam, I didn't spot him during the battle. However, I learned from a captured soldier that he had survived unharmed and moved with Lee's troops into Virginia. Flower beds are not a priority nowadays, as Dick mentioned while discussing his horse's impatience and lawn damage. Dick's horse, well-rested, was eager as they left Pendleton. Riding through the deep woods in the late hours of the night, the cool October air provided relief after a scorching summer and fall. Despite the unusual dryness, they pressed on towards the army before daybreak. The news of a Confederate division nearing Frankfort for the state's inauguration prompted Colonel Winchester to send a scouting party, including Dick, to gather intelligence. Native Kentuckians in the group aimed to approach Frankfort discreetly through the hills. The dryness of the landscape, despite Kentucky's usual abundance of water sources, was striking as they neared the capital.|"1.

"The aridness amazed Dick. Dust was present here, much like in Virginia, but there it was stirred up by large armies. In this place, their small group raised the dust, and as the October breezes blew over the dry fields, it filled their eyes. Yet, it was a superb region, with enriching limestone beneath the surface, where the grass thrives thick and long, even through winter. ""If one was superstitious,"" said Dick, ""they might think it's a punishment for all the fighting and killing over matters many don't comprehend, which could have been settled differently."" ""It's easy to imagine,"" said Warner, ""but here we are, fighting and killing persistently. It's a simple math question: anger of the South plus anger of the North plus a bit of reason equals 100. With anger at 90%, what chance does reason at 10% have?"" As Dick spoke, Colonel Winchester, who had noticed the man, gave the order to halt. The stranger, Malachi White, approached, sharing a memory of Dick's stay at his house.

Dick and his companions continued their journey through the forest, reaching the sparsely inhabited high hills. The cool October nights provided a welcome relief from the day's heat and dust as they rode in silence. Powell, one of the group, suggested they could reach the old town of Frankfort by midnight. He offered to lead them close to the town, where they could stay hidden and observe from a vantage point. Excited, May and Powell, both young Frankforters, eagerly took on the task. As they rode through the open forest, they reached a creek with clear, cold water, allowing men and horses to drink and refresh themselves. Powell shared a story about a tree where Daniel Boone had killed a bear in the past. The night was illuminated by the moon, revealing the town of Frankfort below, occupied by Kirby Smith's division. Dick wondered which house housed Bragg, the triumphant leader.|"1. What did Powell suggest the group could reach by midnight?

Colonel Winchester, accompanied by May and Powell, scouted the area around Frankfort, observing Confederate preparations for the inauguration of Governor Hawes.
