He looked at himself as if paying tribute to Rubens, whom he had previously ignored, never having visited Antwerp (for, unless you have been to Antwerp, it's as silly to claim you've seen Rubens as it is to believe you've seen Murillo outside Seville or Raffaelle outside Rome). He carefully studied Gretchen, loving Scheffer, but failed to connect with her. His paintings were all about Phryne, in various settings and emotions, but always Phryne. One evening, pondering whether to paint in the historic Brabant street or seek new inspiration in the East, he saw a simple peasant passing by with a radiant face. He realized that there are women who repel evil, unlike Phryne. Despite this, he knew the inevitable outcome when the strong overpower the weak. Bébée, eager to help, wanted to pray for him but needed his name for Our Lady to understand. Despite the angels' wisdom, Franz couldn't see the point of being wise if it meant giving up almond gingerbread.|"1. What does the artist's paintings primarily focus on?
