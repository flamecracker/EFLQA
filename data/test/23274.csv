E) Will's fall off a cliff"|A) Larry's encounter with a wild animal|Yes
Larry, emerging from the snow like a ghost, shared the tragic loss of a mule that fell off a cliff. Will, saddened, started to recount his own mule's demise. Suddenly, Bunco yanked Will away from a cliff edge, saving him from a fatal fall. As a storm raged, they pressed on through the pass, braving the elements. The storm cleared, and they descended towards Columbia's plains. Transitioning from icy mountains to tropical heat, they relaxed in a canoe down the Orinoco. Larry, forgetting his food, was comforted by Will's foresight. Crocodiles and jungle noises disrupted their peace. At a tiger-hunter's camp, Larry's encounter with a wild animal caused chaos.
