"During a political event, Abraham Lincoln cleverly turned the tables on an adversary who had insulted him. Colonel Dick Taylor, a Democratic speaker, mocked the Whigs as ""rag barons"" and ""silk stocking gentry,"" contrasting them with the Democrats, whom he praised as the ""bone and sinew"" of the nation. However, when the Colonel's extravagant attire was accidentally revealed, Lincoln humorously exposed the irony by contrasting his own humble appearance with the Colonel's ostentatious display. This unexpected twist delighted the crowd and marked the end of Colonel Taylor's effectiveness as a campaign speaker. Lincoln's wit and ability to use humor to his advantage earned him a reputation as a skilled orator, leading to his election as a Whig representative in a predominantly Democratic county. Lincoln's success in moving the State capital to Springfield further enhanced his reputation and influence, setting the stage for his future political career."|"5.
