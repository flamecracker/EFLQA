The Toscaneli Map was a guide used by Columbus on his voyage across the Atlantic. It resembled the Behaim Globe, which depicted the world in 1492 based on Toscanelli's map. The Behaim Globe showed no continent between Spain and Japan, with mythical islands bridging the gap. Maps from 1548 and 1745 reveal evolving knowledge about the world. Geographical discovery has been driven by a desire to conquer, trade, and explore. Captain Cook's voyages marked a shift towards scientific curiosity. The history of geographical discovery traces the gradual knowledge of lands beyond the Mediterranean. Exploration often relied on guides who knew the territories well. The European partition of Africa exemplifies the convergence of conquest, trade, and scientific motives in exploration. The history of geographical discovery is intertwined with the history of conquest and the spreading knowledge of the world.|"1.

During the Middle Ages, much knowledge from ancient times was lost, and imagination and theory replaced it. The Arabs were the true inheritors of Greek science during this period and contributed to geographical knowledge. The discovery of America marked a new era in modern history and geography. In the last four hundred years, more of the world has been explored than in the previous four thousand years. This exploration has shaped modern society and will influence the future. Englishmen will play a significant role in addressing the challenges related to these discoveries. The Greeks learned about geography from the Phoenicians and Homer's poems. Homer imagined the world as a flat shield surrounded by a wide river called Ocean. These early conceptions influenced later views of the world. The Greeks likely got the idea of an encircling ocean from the Babylonians. They believed in seven zones or climates dividing the world, represented by islets on a map of Mesopotamia.|"1.

"After Homer and Hesiod, Greek knowledge expanded through colonization around the Eastern Mediterranean. Southern Italy still speaks a Greek dialect due to the vast Greek colonies there, known as ""Magna Grecia."" Marseilles, established in 600 B.C., sent colonies along the Gulf of Lyons. Greek cities dotted the Black Sea coast, with Byzantium being historically significant. Greeks also colonized North Africa and Aegean Sea islands. Anaximander of Miletus invented map-drawing in the 6th century B.C. The gnomon, attributed to Anaximander, helped determine latitude. Herodotus of Halicarnassus, known as the Father of History, extensively traveled and provided accurate information about Egypt, Babylonia, Persia, and Greece, also detailing Scythia and Persia's royal roads."|"1.

One of the intriguing tales he shares involves a group of five young men from the Nasamonians who embarked on a journey from Southern Libya, west of the Soudan. After traveling for numerous days to the west, they stumbled upon a grove of trees. To their surprise, they were captured by men of remarkably small stature. These captors guided them through marshes to a grand city inhabited by black men of similar size, with a large river flowing through it. Herodotus linked this city to the Nile, but based on the journey's description, it seems more likely to have been the Niger, suggesting that the Nasamonians might have reached Timbuctoo! Following Herodotus, Xenophon and Alexander's expeditions expanded Greek knowledge of Asia. Additionally, mariners' log-books revealed the Carthaginian admiral Hanno's voyage to Sierra Leone, where he encountered Gorillas. Another log-book by Scylax detailed sailing distances in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. These accounts, along with Alexander's admiral Nearchus navigating from the mouth of the Indus to the Arabian Gulf, and Hippalus discovering the monsoons' use for sailing from Arabia to India, enriched Greek geographical knowledge. Megasthenes' insights from his embassy to the Indian king of the Punjab and Pytheas' travels to Britain and Thule further broadened geographical understanding.

Another log-book by Scylax detailed sailing distances in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. These accounts, along with Alexander's admiral Nearchus navigating from the mouth of the Indus to the Arabian Gulf, and Hippalus discovering the monsoons' use for sailing from Arabia to India, enriched Greek geographical knowledge. Megasthenes' insights from his embassy to the Indian king of the Punjab and Pytheas' travels to Britain and Thule further broadened geographical understanding. Eratosthenes, the librarian of Alexandria, made significant contributions to scientific geography|"6. Whose travels to Britain and Thule further broadened geographical understanding?

"After Eratosthenes' time, the Roman Empire expanded, taking over lands from Alexander and Carthaginians, reaching Gaul, Britain, and Germany. STRABO, a Greek writer around 20 B.C., refined Eratosthenes' ideas, rejecting Thule but acknowledging Ireland as the northernmost habitable place. A seaman's manual, the _Periplus_ of the Erythræan Sea, detailed coasts from Aden to the Ganges, impacting Ptolemy's later work. Ptolemy, around 150 A.D., synthesized ancient knowledge, introducing latitude and longitude. Despite errors, his work influenced geography for centuries, though later corrected. He also speculated on a vast southern land, influencing later explorations. Ptolemy's legacy remains significant, shaping astronomy and geography for over a millennium. His method of dividing the Earth into ""climates"" based on day length was pivotal for determining latitude, despite its simplicity."|"1. What did STRABO refine from Eratosthenes' ideas?

In this chapter, I have briefly outlined the accomplishments and names of the Greek scholars who compiled the knowledge gained by traders, soldiers, and explorers about the known world in ancient times. Much of this information was acquired not through deliberate geographical exploration, but rather through military campaigns aimed at conquest. To understand how the Greeks and the Roman Empire acquired this knowledge, we need to delve into the various stages of conquest that led to the discovery of different regions in the Old World. The rise and progress of ancient civilizations in the East are detailed in the companion book of this series. Notably, early civilizations thrived along major rivers like the Nile, Euphrates, Tigris, Ganges, and Yang-tse-Kiang. The Romans, through a series of expansions and conquests, eventually amassed a wealth of information summarized by Ptolemy.|"1. What is the main focus of the text passage?

During the first century before our era, Rome's reach expanded under the leadership of Cæsar and Pompey. Cæsar pushed Rome's borders to Gaul, Western Germany, and Britain, while Pompey paved the way for Roman rule in Asia Minor, Western Asia, and Egypt. The Romans built straight, durable roads to move their legions across the vast empire, aiding in its preservation for nearly five centuries. Roman law and the worship of the Emperor unified the empire, fostering a sense of community. However, after the Roman Empire's fall, geographical knowledge was lost and distorted during the Dark Ages due to religious influences. Medieval geography was shaped by theological interpretations, resulting in maps depicting a circular world with Jerusalem at the center and Asia greatly exaggerated. Legends and mythical creatures were often included in maps, reflecting the limited knowledge and imaginative interpretations of the time.|"1.

During the eighth and ninth centuries, a significant movement took place in Europe that greatly impacted the knowledge and exploration of the northern European peoples. The Vikings, also known as Sea-Rovers, from Norway emerged as a formidable naval power. They conducted bold attacks along the European coastlines, establishing stable governments in various regions. The Vikings played a crucial role in preventing further disruptions in Europe, forming kingdoms in places like Iceland, England, and Ireland. Notably, they are believed to be the first Europeans to discover America, with evidence suggesting they settled in Vinland, possibly present-day North America. The development of the mariner's compass, which allowed sailors to navigate away from the shore, was a crucial advancement that facilitated extended voyages and exploration. The use of compasses spread from the Chinese to European mariners, enhancing their ability to navigate the seas accurately. The creation of detailed maritime charts called Portulanos further improved navigation, enabling safer and more precise voyages. These advancements in navigation laid the foundation for future explorations and discoveries, marking a significant period in medieval geography.|"1.

The earliest communication between nations was through the sea, with the Phoenicians establishing trade centers along the Mediterranean coasts. The Greeks followed suit in the Ægean and Black Seas. Caravan routes were also established between Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia. The Romans were great road builders, creating solid roads that have lasted for centuries. These roads were crucial for the expansion of the Roman Empire, allowing quick movement of troops. Stations were built along these roads, forming the basis of Europe's major highways today. Asia, with its plateaus and mountain ranges, had significant caravan routes that connected Eastern and Western Asia. Communication between Southern Asia and Europe mainly occurred by sea. Europe heavily relied on the East for luxuries like silk, spices, and gems. The East provided Europe with essential goods, from medical supplies to incense.

The earliest communication between nations was through the sea, with the Phoenicians establishing trade centers along the Mediterranean coasts. The Greeks followed suit in the Ægean and Black Seas. Caravan routes were also established between Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia. The Romans were great road builders, creating solid roads that have lasted for centuries. These roads were crucial for the expansion of the Roman Empire, allowing quick movement of troops. Stations were built along these roads, forming the basis of Europe's major highways today. Asia, with its plateaus and mountain ranges, had significant caravan routes that connected Eastern and Western Asia. Communication between Southern Asia and Europe mainly occurred by sea. Europe heavily relied on the East for luxuries like silk, spices, and gems. The East provided Europe with essential goods, from medical supplies to incense. Europe's culture and trade were greatly influenced by the East.|"2. Which civilization was known for establishing trade centers along the Mediterranean coasts?

"During the era of Prince Henry, the northwest coast of Africa was known up to Cape Bojador. Norman sailors had ventured beyond Cape Non, also called Cape Nun, believing nothing existed beyond it. Prince Henry aimed to determine if the African coast turned east after Cape Bojador and if ancient beliefs about the torrid zone's uninhabitability were true. Expeditions were sent each year, surpassing the previous ones. Madeira was discovered in 1420, and Cape Bojador was crossed in 1435. By 1455, the Gambia was reached, but locals were hostile. Prince Henry's men brought back around a thousand natives for the Portuguese nobles. The discovery of Cape Verde Islands in 1460 marked the end of Prince Henry's explorations. The Portuguese continued exploring, with Fernando de Poo finding an island in 1471, and Pedro d'Escobar crossing the equator. Stone pillars called _padraos_ were erected to mark their presence, and in 1484, the River Congo was discovered. Information about a Christian king to the east led to attempts by land and sea to reach him. Bartholomew Diaz rounded the Cape of Good Hope, later renamed from ""Stormy Cape"" by King João."|"1.

For nearly a decade after Prince Henry's plan to reach India was put on hold, Columbus successfully discovered a western voyage to the Indies in 1492 while working for the Spanish monarchs. This achievement made the traditional Portuguese route along Africa seem less appealing. King João passed away three years later, and his successor Emmanuel, in the third year of his reign, commissioned Vasco da Gama to attempt the eastward route to India. Facing challenges from Moors along the African coast, Gama eventually reached Calicut with the help of an Indian pilot. Despite initial resistance, Gama managed to establish an alliance with the Zamorin of Calicut. His successful voyage threatened the trade monopolies of the Venetians and the Sultan of Egypt, leading to tensions and naval preparations against the Portuguese. Subsequent Portuguese expeditions under Pedro Alvarez Cabral and Vasco da Gama further expanded their discoveries, including lands like Santa Cruz in Brazil and various islands.|"1.

During the 16th century, King Emmanuel of Portugal adopted the Venetian method of colonization, sending Vice-Doges to oversee trade and collect tribute in their colonies. Affonso de Albuquerque, a notable Viceroy, captured key posts like Goa in India and the Moluccas, also known as the Spice Islands. The Portuguese monopoly on spices led to a rise in prices in European markets. In 1521, the Portuguese secured the Spice Islands, just as Magellan reached the Philippines, nearing the same goal. The Pope's Bull in 1493 divided discoveries between Spain and Portugal, with Portugal gaining rights to the east. The line of demarcation was adjusted to include Brazil, discovered by Cabral. The Spice Islands' ownership was contested, eventually resolved through a family compact. Portugal dominated the Indian Ocean trade until the 17th century when new competitors emerged after the Spanish-Portuguese union. Meanwhile, the idea of reaching the Indies by sailing westward captivated a Genoese sailor, inspired by ancient beliefs in a round earth and mysterious islands to the west.|"1.

In 1642, ABEL JANSSEN TASMAN led an expedition to explore the southern land. Tasman sailed southeast from Mauritius and discovered Van Diemen's Land, now known as Tasmania. He then found Staaten Land, which was part of New Zealand. Tasman's voyage also led to the discovery of several Pacific islands. His explorations helped reduce the mystery surrounding the southern continent. Later, William Dampier explored New Holland and noted the kangaroo's habits. These Dutch voyages increased knowledge about the southern lands. Captain Lemuel Gulliver's journey to Lilliput in Swift's tale reflects the geographical understanding of Australia at the time. The search for the Spice Islands drove these discoveries, setting the stage for future explorations. James Cook later played a crucial role in furthering geographical knowledge through his scientific voyages.|"1. What did ABEL JANSSEN TASMAN discover during his expedition in 1642?

"Shortly after the Berlin Congress, England and Germany finalized their claims in South-West Africa. They also determined their ""spheres of influence"" in East Africa. The British East Africa Association managed the land north of Victoria Nyanza, bordered by the Congo Free State to the west and reaching the revolted provinces of Egypt to the north. In South Africa, a Chartered Company led by Mr. Cecil Rhodes controlled the region from Cape Colony to German East Africa and the Congo Free State. Agreements in 1890-91 set boundaries for Portuguese Angola, Portuguese East Africa, and Italian claims in East Africa. Delimitation agreements between Germany and England in 1890 defined borders in the Cameroons, Togoland, and along the Niger River. Friction persisted over unclear boundaries, especially between England and France in Africa. Political complications in Egypt led to joint administration by France and England, resulting in British occupation after a rebellion.

In the past, explorers like Baffin and Inglefield mapped out the islands in the North American region, with Smith Sound being a significant area reaching beyond the 80th parallel. Kane and later explorers like Hayes and Hall continued the investigations around Smith Sound. Concurrently, Professor Nordenskiold successfully navigated the northeast passage, opening up new commercial routes. Inspired by his success, Nordenskiold embarked on a journey towards Behring Strait. In 1878, he nearly completed the northeast passage, reaching Cape North. Despite challenges with ice, he eventually rounded East Cape, marking the completion of the northeast passage. This accomplishment led to increased interest in Arctic exploration, culminating in an international Polar Conference in 1879. The conference aimed to establish scientific observation stations around the North Pole. Subsequent expeditions, including Lieutenant Greely's, pushed the boundaries of exploration, with Nansen's bold plan to drift across the Arctic Ocean aboard the Fram proving successful. His journey reached 86.14° N, nearly 200 miles from the Pole, showcasing the spirit of adventure and discovery in Arctic exploration.|"1.

This accomplishment led to increased interest in Arctic exploration, culminating in an international Polar Conference in 1879. The conference aimed to establish scientific observation stations around the North Pole. Subsequent expeditions, including Lieutenant Greely's, pushed the boundaries of exploration, with Nansen's bold plan to drift across the Arctic Ocean aboard the Fram proving successful. His journey reached 86.14° N, nearly 200 miles from the Pole, showcasing the spirit of adventure and discovery in Arctic exploration.|"5.

In the past, explorers like Baffin and Inglefield mapped out the islands in the North American region, with Smith Sound being a significant area reaching beyond the 80th parallel. Kane and later explorers like Hayes and Hall continued the investigations around Smith Sound. Concurrently, Professor Nordenskiold successfully navigated the northeast passage, opening up new commercial routes.

In the past, Arctic exploration reached a pinnacle with Nansen's successful voyage. Following his daring method of abandoning his base, Andrée embarked on a balloon journey towards the Pole in 1897, equipped for a prolonged Arctic stay. While Andrée's whereabouts remain unknown after a year, inspired by Nansen, hope lingers for his safe return and the realization of a significant geographical discovery. Interestingly, the Arctic now captivates global attention for contrasting reasons: the pursuit of wealth and the thirst for knowledge and honor. Throughout history, notable milestones in geography include the invention of maps by Anaximander of Miletus, the first written geography by Hecatæus of Miletus, and the travels of explorers like Pytheas to Britain and Alexander to India.|"1.
