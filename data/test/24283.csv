After three days of hard work, we finished building the raft's body. We covered the long logs with shorter ones and added a flooring of slabs on the upper tier. The platform stood over a foot above the water, sturdy and ready to keep us dry. Now, it was time to construct the house, the most challenging yet rewarding part of our project. The house was to be eighteen feet long and six feet wide, placed in the middle of the platform. I crafted frames for the sills and plates, boarded them up and down, and added windows and a door. As we neared completion, a shortage of boards threatened our progress. However, a stroke of luck brought down extra boards in a rainstorm, which we caught with a boom. Unfortunately, a mishap occurred when my companion, Sim, slipped and fell into the water. Despite his inability to swim, I leaped in to save him, fearing for his life and the project's success.|"1.

I stayed up all night, keeping watch on the raft while my friends slept. As morning arrived, the sunlight and the songs of birds greeted me. Despite feeling tired, I let my companions rest. Flora woke up feeling refreshed, and Sim, who would have slept till noon, finally rose after a long slumber. We had a makeshift breakfast without a table or enough chairs. After steering for a while, I took a nap, and my friends allowed me to rest until the afternoon. We encountered various boats on the river without drawing much attention. By evening, I planned shifts for steering during the night. As we entered the Mississippi River, the current grew stronger. I took the helm again while Sim kept watch. Despite some doubts, Sim managed to stay awake and woke me at sunrise, reporting a near encounter with a steamboat during the night.|"2. How did Flora feel when she woke up?

I didn't plan to write about our daily journey down the river. Each day seemed much like the next, and all were the same. On the first afternoon on the Mississippi, we neared a village with a steamboat landing. Needing supplies, I tried to stop, but the raft was used to moving forward. We passed the village due to deep water, missing out on milk for my coffee. Later, we reached a larger village. There, I bought a clock, a sail, groceries, and provisions. I rigged the sail and improved our living space. With the sail up, we sailed faster, steering better and saving time by taking shortcuts. Sim and I shared steering duties, using the sail when the wind was right, making our journey easier and more comfortable.|"1.

"Almost every day we landed in a town during our river journey. On Sundays, we would stop and attend church if possible. One rainy day, we moored by a riverbank. The rain made it uncomfortable to steer the raft, so Sim and I rested while Flora read. I had set up the house on the raft to my liking. In one town, I bought a ""Panorama of the Mississippi River,"" a chart showing towns, streams, and distances. As we reached the Missouri River's mouth, the vastness of the water amazed us. St. Louis, a bustling city, left us in awe. We marveled at the steamboats and flat-boats passing by. Our journey continued towards the Ohio River, where the waters widened, and we experienced the transition from Wisconsin's spring to the South's summer. The lush greenery and pleasant weather enchanted us. Despite encountering reckless steamboats, we marveled at nature's beauty and the adventure that lay ahead."|"1.

As we observed the steamboats speeding down the river, disaster struck when one of them exploded, sending debris flying through the air. The violent blast shook our raft, causing chaos. Quickly, I abandoned the steering oar to help Sim as the raft spun in the strong current. We hoisted the sail and adjusted the ropes to navigate upstream. Despite our efforts, we struggled against the river's force. Meanwhile, the wreckage from the steamboat floated downstream. Spotting a person in need of rescue, we attempted to reach them but faced challenges due to the distance and the raft's movement. After failed attempts, we secured a long rope to aid in the rescue mission.|"1. What caused chaos on the raft?

I was a strong swimmer and felt confident in my abilities to help the person in danger. The Mississippi River's swift current made it a tough swim, but I managed to reach the girl in need.

Flora and I discussed our plan, deciding to remove her wet clothes. I carried her to my sister's room and laid her on a blanket. After closing the shutters and stoking the fire, I left Flora to rest.
