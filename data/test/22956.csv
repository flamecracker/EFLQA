The wide pathway, known as the Alley of the Oranges, led the children through the garden towards the center. Instead of the expected fruit and flower beds, they found themselves in a forest of trees neatly arranged in rows. As they walked, they glimpsed the Grand Alley in the distance, bustling with people strolling about. Rollo and Jane spotted children speaking fluent French and playing with hoops. After a brief rest on a stone bench in the Grand Alley, they continued their walk, marveling at the magnificent views around them. Eventually, they reached a large octagonal pond where children watched goldfish and sailed miniature ships. Feeling uneasy about engaging in such activities on the Sabbath, Rollo and Jennie decided to move on. Exiting the garden, they were met with grand buildings and bridges, signaling the end of their garden adventure and the beginning of a new chapter in the bustling square.|"1.

The square, though not empty, was a sight to behold. In the center stood an obelisk on a tall pedestal, surrounded by two grand fountains and colossal marble statues. The place was adorned with bronze and gilt columns for gaslights, smooth sidewalks made of artificial stone, and bustling roadways with carriages and horsemen passing through. The fountains were a marvel, with three towering basins stacked on top of one another. Water spouted from the top basin, cascading down into the middle basin, which overflowed into the lowest basin. Bronze figures of men holding fish spouted water into the middle basin. At the foot of the obelisk, the children marveled at its towering height, as tall as a steeple. Suddenly, they were surprised by the arrival of their uncle George and his American friend, who explained the engineering feat of the solid stone obelisk and its massive pedestal.|"1.

Mr. George explained the fascinating history of the obelisk to the students. The obelisk was not originally meant for its current location but was crafted in Egypt thousands of years ago. It was a challenging task to transport it to Paris. The French king sent a large team to dismantle and ship it. They constructed a special vessel for its transport and had to clear Arab huts and houses in its path. It took immense effort, with 800 men working for three months to move it to the river. The obelisk was carefully encased in wood to protect it during the journey. Once in Paris, it took nearly a year to set up the machinery to raise it onto a pedestal. The grand event attracted over a hundred thousand people, including the king and his family. The obelisk was adorned with ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, adding to its mystique.|"1.

As the group continued their walk along the Grand Avenue, Mr. George suggested that they follow him and his friend up the avenue of the Elysian Fields to avoid getting lost in the bustling crowd.

The Grand Avenue was wide and filled with carriages and horsemen, while side avenues were designated for pedestrians with rows of trees for shade. The children were captivated by the various sights and sounds, from a young boy on a pony distributing papers to a man selling stockings on the ground. As they walked, they encountered a boy baking griddle cakes and an elegant little omnibus drawn by goats, filled with joyous children enjoying their ride.|"1.

Jennie was thrilled with the omnibus, but what came next delighted her even more. A carriage, resembling a real one, was large enough for several children. It was open like a barouche, allowing the riders to see all around. Inside were two seats and a high one for the coachman in front and another for the footman at the back. The carriage, like the omnibus, was pulled by goats, four in this case. As the carriage passed, Rollo and Jennie searched for Mr. George and the other man to no avail. Nearby, a little girl read a card posted on a tree with a clear, silvery voice. She turned to Rollo and Jane after reading, smiling pleasantly. The square was bustling with booths selling cakes, toys like hoops and kites, and colorful pictures. A man with a can on his back sold drinks, using a bell to attract customers.|"1.

Nearby, a little girl read a card posted on a tree with a clear, silvery voice. She turned to Rollo and Jane after reading, smiling pleasantly.

After observing the readers and students through a glass partition, the children followed Mr. George back through the rooms they had traversed. Instead of exiting the way they came, they descended through new corridors to a room filled with people looking at engravings. The room was adorned with bound volumes of prints, some colored and others plain, all very beautiful. Mr. George informed the children that they could request any book from the attendants to peruse the prints. The room had a fountain in the center surrounded by a basin of water. Outside, the square was paved with asphaltum and shaded by trees where children played. Upon returning to the hotel, the children watched other kids playing in the square from Mr. George's room. Among them was a boy in unique attire, playing with a ball. Rollo and the boy communicated through gestures, as they spoke different languages.

Rollo decided to give the girl a coin after stopping to admire her chapel. He and Carlos strolled down the Boulevard, chatting in different languages without listening to each other. They enjoyed the companionship of the conversation, much like birds singing to their mates. They boarded an omnibus, noticing the unique sign indicating when it was full. After a series of adventures and bus changes, they arrived at the garden gates, passing by soldiers who allowed peaceful visitors to enter.

Rollo and Carlos explored the Garden of Plants, captivated by the sights around them. They chatted excitedly, pointing out various animals in their enclosures.

Rollo and Carlos observed the monkeys with keen interest. They found a great spot to watch from, as the land sloped up, allowing those farther back a clear view over those in front. Chairs were scattered under the trees at the top of the slope. Rollo noticed some empty chairs and gestured for Carlos to sit with him.
