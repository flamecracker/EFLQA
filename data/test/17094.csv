Meanwhile, Clara Barton was courageously aiding soldiers on the most violent battlefields. When you return home, inquire with your grandfather about the battles of Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and the Wilderness. Clara Barton was present at all these significant events.

Bertie, who was just six at the time, heard about the children suffering without shelter or food. Without a word, he took down his red savings bank from the mantel. Although we were still living in a cabin, we were slowly getting back on our feet. Bertie emptied his bank of ninety-three cents, added his tin soldiers, his grandmother's knitted mittens, and even his best Sunday clothes to the table. He was repaying the debt of gratitude he felt towards the Red Cross for their help during the floods. The Red Cross also played a crucial role in providing aid during other disasters like the Galveston flood and the Johnstown flood. The society collects donations to help those in need, ensuring that contributions reach those affected by disasters promptly.|"6.
