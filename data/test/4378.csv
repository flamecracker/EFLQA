In the quaint villages of South Kent with names like 'den' and the serene Sussex downs where villages end with 'hurst,' reside the humble folk who speak a simple language.

Market carts rumble down the London road during summer nights, carrying young men seeking a better life and girls looking for work. The influence of the city is felt close by, with the annual arrival of the hoppers and the distant sound of music from across the borders. Despite the picturesque hills, the local speech is not purely pastoral. This story tells of a practical aunt with savings and old furniture, torn between her two nieces. When an unexpected ankle sprain brings one niece to her aid, the tale takes an unexpected turn, revealing the complexities of family bonds and providential timing.|"1.

Whenever I think of 'home,' it's Whitecroft that comes to mind. The narrow windows, thatched roof, and surrounding farm buildings create an image of warmth. Whitecroft sits on a shoulder of the Downs, offering a clear view of the sea. From there, you can see Felscombe nestled snugly with its church, elms, and gardens. The wind from the sea sweeps across the Downs, making the house sway and chimneys rock. One stormy night, a stranger arrived seeking shelter. Wet and injured, he fainted, and we nursed him back to health. The stranger, Edgar Linley, an artist, had lost his way painting the sunset. He stayed with us, charming everyone with his ways. His time with us taught Lilian and him much, though my feelings remained a mystery.|"1. What comes to mind when the speaker thinks of 'home'?
