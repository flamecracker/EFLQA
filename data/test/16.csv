One significant outcome of the encounter at the lagoon was the newfound friendship between the redskins and Peter Pan. By rescuing Tiger Lily, Peter won the loyalty of her tribe, who vigilantly guarded their underground home, preparing for an imminent pirate attack.

When Peter asserted his authority by saying, “Peter Pan has spoken,” the redskins obeyed, contrasting their casual interactions with the other boys. Wendy, though sympathetic to the redskins, remained loyal to Peter. As evening fell on what would be remembered as the Night of Nights, the children gathered for a make-believe tea, causing a ruckus.

Peter was absent! The group stared at him, their sticks slung over their shoulders, each stick holding a bundle. Their initial assumption was that Peter had reconsidered letting them go. Tink flew up a tree, but no one followed as the pirates viciously attacked the natives. The air filled with screams and clashing steel above, while below, silence reigned. Mouths hung open, frozen in shock. Wendy dropped to her knees, arms outstretched towards Peter. All arms reached out to him, silently pleading for him not to abandon them. Peter grabbed his sword, ready for battle. In the savage laws of warfare, it's the natives who strike first, with cunning timing just before dawn. The white men had built a stockade on a hill, near a stream, anticipating the dawn attack. The night crept on, the savages scouting silently through the grass, imitating the coyote's call. The Piccaninnies displayed trust in Peter's honor, preparing diligently for the pirates' assault. The redskins meticulously scouted the island, confirming Hook's presence and setting up a deadly ambush. The redskins waited patiently, ready to strike at the break of day, while Hook's surprise attack caught the natives off guard. Tiger Lily and her warriors faced the pirates head-on, knowing their fate but fighting bravely until the end.|"1. What was the initial assumption of the group when they saw Peter was absent?

She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the Neverland, and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become; but he never noticed, he had so much to say about himself.

Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops.

Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls."|"1.
