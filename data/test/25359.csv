At bedtime, we find comfort with our loving mothers singing lullabies by our side, as the room darkens and we drift off to sleep. Playing by our father's knees in the evening is filled with joy, unlike the birds or lambs in the fields. The Sandman, with his bag of shining sand, visits children with eyes of blue, black, gray, and brown, gently coaxing them to sleep. His boat gathers sand from distant shores where no storm dares to disturb. When naughty children cry, he sprinkles gray sand to calm their restless eyes. So, when the Sandman's song whispers in the twilight, it's time to rest and let his magic sand bring dreams. And as we snuggle close to daddy by the warm fire, tales of fairy folk who dance under the moonlight fill our minds. The fairies, with their silver bells and crimson moth rides, visit children as they sleep, bestowing sweet dreams and tender kisses. So, little ones, snuggle close, for the fairy folk may visit you tonight.|"1. What is the Sandman's role in the passage?
