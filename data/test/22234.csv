I decided to let the goblins have their fun without bothering me. Some ladies admired my bravery for sleeping there, but I couldn't admit I was scared by a silly tale and a strange noise. I tried to distract myself by reciting the multiplication table, but my thoughts were too wild. Eventually, I gave up pretending to be brave and embraced my fear. As I lay there, imagining B. Tucker, a stealthy step outside my window startled me. It turned out to be a human foe climbing the tree. I decided to scare them back, brandishing a dagger and shouting.

"Yes, my dear, pins and people are alike, and that rusty darning-needle need not stare so rudely, for I shall prove what I say. We are divided into classes by birth and constitution, and each can do much in its own sphere. I am a shawl pin, and it would be foolish in me to aspire to the duties of those dainty lace pins made to fasten a collar. I am contented with my lot, however, and, being of a strong make and enterprising spirit, have had many adventures, some perils, and great satisfactions since I left the factory long ago. I well remember how eagerly I looked about me when the paper in which I lived, with some hundreds of relations, was hung up in a shop window, to display our glittering ranks and tempt people to buy. At last a purchaser came, a dashing young lady who bought us with several other fancy articles, and carried us away in a smart little bag, humming and talking to herself, in what I thought a very curious way.

When we were taken out I was all in a flutter to see where I was and what would happen next. There were so many of us, I could hardly hope to go first, for I was in the third row, and most people take us in order.
