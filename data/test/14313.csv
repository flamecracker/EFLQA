The troop marched the following morning. Ralph enjoyed the new experience but was relieved when they arrived at the village after two days. The soldiers stayed with the villagers, while the officers lodged at the inn. Besides raids to seize stills, which they found aplenty, there was little to occupy them in Ballyporrit. The local gentry visited, extending invitations to dinners and dances, but Ralph preferred solitude. O'Connor and Lieutenant Desmond embraced social events, leaving Ralph to take duty willingly. Ralph often strolled to the cliffs overlooking the sea, watching the waves crash below and seabirds soar above. The desolate land offered little human presence, with only sporadic sightings of revenue officers. Smuggling tales intrigued Ralph, but he never ventured down the treacherous rocks to the water's edge. Despite the lonely landscape, Ralph occasionally felt like he was being observed, glimpsing figures that quickly vanished.|"1. What did Ralph prefer to do during his time in Ballyporrit?

Ralph, who read about Ghent's history years ago, found the old town fascinating. It was hard to believe that its quiet streets were once filled with Europe's most turbulent inhabitants. The town witnessed battles where Von Artevelde was killed, and the streets flowed with blood from warring factions. The monks made up a significant part of the population, and it was odd to hear everyone speaking French when they were about to face the French as enemies. The locals were as curious about their English visitors as the visitors were about them. The English soldiers stationed in Ghent wore scarlet uniforms that amazed the townspeople. The soldiers stayed for two weeks before marching to Brussels. The military situation around Brussels was tense, with different divisions and armies strategically positioned. Napoleon's movements were unpredictable, and the allied forces were on high alert.|"1. What fascinated Ralph about Ghent's old town?

Soon after two o'clock, Picton's division, leading the column, heard cannon shots in quick succession, signaling the start of the battle. The weary men, having marched over twenty miles, straightened up as the pace quickened. A heavier roar of cannon to the left indicated Napoleon's attack on the Prussians. The troops pressed eagerly forward, their eyes fixed ahead, eager to join the conflict. The officers' confident voices urged the men on as messengers rode up, informing General Picton of the urgency to advance. The Dutch and Belgian troops, initially holding their ground, began to lose heart until Picton's forces arrived. The arrival of Picton's column boosted the morale of the allies, who met their foes with renewed courage. The French, who had been advancing triumphantly, were pushed back as the British forces, led by Picton, arrived on the scene. The battle's tide turned as the defenders were reinforced by the Duke of Brunswick's corps, and Picton's Ninety-fifth battalion cleared the way for communication between Quatre Bras and Ligny. Ney, however, prepared to advance with strength, using hedgerows for cover and positioning artillery strategically. The Duke of Wellington, returning from a conference, saw the French's heavy column behind the wood of Bossu and directed strategic movements to counter the enemy's advance. Despite the valiant efforts of the Belgian and Dutch troops, they were pushed back by the French advance and heavy artillery fire.|"1. What signaled the start of the battle?

In vain, the French cavalry charged repeatedly. Despite their efforts, the French infantry couldn't hold their ground. The positions they fought hard to secure were lost one after another. Picton's division reclaimed the village, while Piermont was taken by the Ninety-fifth and the German legion. The guards forced the enemy out of the wood of Bossu. As night fell, Ney retreated to Frasnes, and the British soldiers, exhausted but victorious, lit fires and camped where they fought bravely. The troops stacked their arms and began working. They chopped hedges, broke fences, and lit fires. Due to the late hour and confusion, rations were scarce. The soldiers helped collect the wounded, offering aid regardless of allegiance. The light company assisted in the effort, taking turns with other regiments. Despite fatigue and thirst, the troops were in high spirits. They had marched thirty miles and fought for six hours. Water was scarce, but they pressed on, tending to the wounded with care and bravery.|"1. What happened to the French cavalry during the battle?

O'Connor nodded in agreement, emphasizing the challenges of fighting alongside other nationalities.
