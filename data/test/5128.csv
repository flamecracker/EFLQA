When I was a young student, we often sympathized with the Carthaginians over the Romans at my school. We felt this way perhaps because we tend to support the underdog. However, we didn't know much about the conflict since our textbooks didn't cover the Punic wars. Hannibal, a skilled general, won battles against the Romans, nearly capturing Rome. The Romans, in turn, showed cruelty when they captured Carthage. While we may admire Hannibal, it was ultimately beneficial for Rome to emerge victorious. Carthage was corrupt, and Rome, despite conquering, aimed to civilize rather than enslave. The soldiers in the story are depicted resting in the afternoon heat, showing signs of fatigue from the scorching day. The soldiers belong to different groups, with the Numidian horsemen being described as lithe and agile, accustomed to the sun, armed lightly with shields, bows, and javelins, wearing colorful clothing and leather belts.|"1. Why did the young students sympathize with the Carthaginians over the Romans?
A) Because the Carthaginians were more powerful
B) Because the Romans were the underdogs
C) Because they admired Hannibal's military skills
D) Because their textbooks covered the Punic wars extensively
E) Because they wanted to support the winning side"|B) Because the Romans were the underdogs|üëç

The leadership structure in Carthage was flawed and led to its downfall. Initially, the government had three estates representing the king, lords, and commons. However, power shifted to a secretive council of thirty members who controlled all aspects of society. The judges were corrupt and easily influenced by the council, resulting in a mockery of justice. The state's resources were misused for personal gain rather than the country's welfare. Carthage's focus on wealth over military strength allowed Rome to surpass them. Malchus, torn between his father's wisdom and his cousin's ambition, witnessed the consequences of Carthage's mismanagement. An expedition led by Hamilcar to punish a tribe in Ethiopia faced challenges, including lions approaching the camp at night. In response, a hunt was organized under the moonlight to protect the soldiers and their horses.|"1. What was one of the flaws in Carthage's leadership structure that contributed to its downfall?

The Carthaginian army, led by Hannibal, faced a formidable enemy force of one hundred thousand soldiers. Despite being weakened from a previous battle and burdened with loot, Hannibal's strategic mind saw the impending danger. As they reached the river, the enemy planned to attack their rear during the crossing. Hannibal's troops maintained order, defending themselves with arrows and slings against the native attacks. Anticipating a morning ambush, Hannibal cleverly devised a plan to cross the river undetected. Under the cover of darkness, the army silently made their way across the ford, with infantry, wagons, cavalry, and elephants moving in unison. At dawn, the Carthaginians surprised the enemy, launching a successful counterattack as the Spaniards attempted to cross the river.

Nessus and Malchus were in a tight spot, hiding in a cave from the natives. They managed to escape a perilous situation by climbing a rope to the top of a rock.

To increase the modes of travel, the entire army was put to work. With the help of the locals, soldiers chopped down trees, carved out canoes, and made enough to transport the army across the river in just two days.

Malchus and Nessus found themselves adrift in a canoe on a swift river. Realizing they needed to lighten the load, Malchus suggested removing their armor and tying their sword belts around the canoe for safety. After freeing themselves of their heavy gear, they tried to steer the canoe towards the riverbank but were unsuccessful.

Exhausted and numb from the cold water, they managed to reach shore, leaving the canoe to drift away. After wringing out their clothes and resting, Malchus spotted a group of natives approaching.

The water was freezing cold as the soldiers waded through the waist-deep river during a flood. On reaching the opposite bank, the Roman general arranged his army for battle. The infantry, consisting of about forty-five thousand soldiers, formed three lines, with sixteen thousand Roman legionaries and six thousand light infantry. The cavalry, five thousand strong, positioned on the flanks. The infantry spanned a front of two and a half miles, while the cavalry extended a mile and a quarter on each side. Hannibal's forces, though inferior, had twenty thousand infantry, eight thousand light infantry, and ten thousand cavalry. The Carthaginian formation was deeper, with a battle line less than two miles long. As the Romans struggled with cold and hunger, Hannibal's troops, well-fed and in high spirits, prepared for battle.

At midnight, in silence, Malchus and Nessus left for the port. A boat waited at a secluded dock, rowing them to the anchored ship half a mile away, ready for an early start.

As spring progressed, Hannibal's supplies dwindled, and the ravaged land offered no provisions. Forced to relocate, he faced Roman advantages of constantly replenished supplies and flexibility in movement. The Roman consuls, Varro and Emilius, prepared for battle.

Neglecting their defenses, the Romans left their magazines vulnerable. Hannibal capitalized on this, seizing the supplies. The Romans, reinforced, advanced for battle. Varro and Emilius disagreed on strategy. Varro led an engagement, repelling Hannibal's forces. The Romans camped near Cannae, with Emilius securing the riverbank.

Hannibal's strategic positioning proved decisive in the battle against the Romans. By cleverly placing his army along the loop of a river, he prevented the Romans from outflanking him, nullifying their numerical advantage.
