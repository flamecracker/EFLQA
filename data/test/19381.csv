Passage|Question|Answer|Model_Response
Let me introduce you to the farmyard animals. It's important to get to know them as they work for us, and maybe some of us work for them too. Helping each other is a vital part of life. Although the farmyard animals may not look or talk like us, they are not so different. For example, the little Chicken who refused to eat gravel when scolded by his mother was relatable. I have many stories to share about our outdoor neighbors, like animals thinking, talking, working, and loving their babies. Animals even help each other in times of trouble. I once had a Quail visit my door during winter, seeking warmth. Animals have their ways of communicating and showing care, just like the Horses who wished the farmer understood their happiness. Enjoy your visits to the farmyard, but remember not to wear red when visiting the Turkey Gobbler.|"1. What is the main idea of the text passage?

In the bustling bee homes, everyone pitches in to help each other, creating a harmonious life. The Queen Mother is a busy bee, laying up to two thousand eggs daily. Most of these eggs are for the Workers, placed in small cells of the brood comb. Occasionally, she lays Drone eggs in larger cells but never Queen eggs, as only one grown Queen is allowed per hive. The Workers, foreseeing the need for a new Queen, prepare a special royal cell by enlarging a Worker egg cell. They feed the hatched Larva with royal jelly, making her grow rapidly. After a cocoon phase, she emerges as a Pupa and matures into a Queen in sixteen days. The Workers protect the young Queens from the Queen Mother, ensuring their safety until they are ready to rule the hive.|"1. What is the primary role of the Queen Mother in the bee hive?

In the bustling bee homes, everyone pitches in to help each other, creating a harmonious life. The Queen Mother is a busy bee, laying up to two thousand eggs daily. Most of these eggs are for the Workers, placed in small cells of the brood comb. Occasionally, she lays Drone eggs in larger cells but never Queen eggs, as only one grown Queen is allowed per hive. The Workers, foreseeing the need for a new Queen, prepare a special royal cell by enlarging a Worker egg cell. They feed the hatched Larva with royal jelly, making her grow rapidly. After a cocoon phase, she emerges as a Pupa and matures into a Queen in sixteen days. The Workers protect the young Queens from the Queen Mother, ensuring their safety until they are ready to rule the hive.|"2. Why do the Workers occasionally create Drone cells in the brood comb?

In the autumn, before the cold drove them to the barn, the Bay Colt wore a poke, remembering the lesson on jumping and running away. His mother was proud, and the Dappled Gray, rarely praising, saw potential. Yet, the Bay Colt grew cross when told to stop cribbing. Some Colts learn obedience easily, while others struggle with jumping, cribbing, and kicking. The older Horses sympathize, helping them understand that doing right leads to a fulfilling life. The farmer introduced a bit to the Bay Colt, gently correcting his behavior. The Gray Colt adapted, finding comfort in understanding the farmer's cues. Despite resistance, the Bay Colt refused to accept the bit, causing concern among the older Horses. The next days brought more driving lessons, where the Gray Colt adapted well, while the Bay Colt remained defiant, proud of his solid hoofs and unwillingness to conform.|"1.

"""A lot of Lambs are like that,"" his mother explained. ""More than you think. They resist and fight because they can't always get their way.

The Meadow Mice living near the farm were friendly cousins of the barn mice. They had distinct differences in size, fur color, voices, and lifestyles. Unlike their cousins, the Meadow Mice preferred the outdoors, never venturing into houses. They welcomed visits from farm animals grazing in the meadow but didn't return the visits. The cows and horses respected these tiny creatures, watching out for them in the grass. Meadow Mice built their homes in tree stumps or near ditches, raising large families. The babies, no bigger than bumblebees at first, stayed in nests until they were ready to explore the world. The parents were gentle, wise, and always kept clean, setting a fine example for their offspring. The eight baby mice were tiny and pink initially, but as they grew, they became a delightful sight for their proud mother and her neighbors.|"1.

As the night passed, all the fowls slept peacefully, except the Shanghai mother who noticed one chick looking unwell. She realized he needed gravel to aid digestion.

The Peacock thought highly of himself and his beautiful feathers. He believed others admired him for his beauty and never gave away his feathers except when he molted. The other fowls, like the Black Spanish and Dorking, were polite but didn't fawn over him.

One day, the Peacock stood on the fence, aloof and self-absorbed, as a group of young fowls passed by. Oblivious to their presence, he engaged the Bantam Chicken in conversation.
