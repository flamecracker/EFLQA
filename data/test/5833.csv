"Dear Sir,

Enclosed is a bill for groceries and goods provided to you over the past six months, totaling $67.34. It should have been settled earlier. As a minister, it is puzzling how you justify using goods without payment, contrary to the Bible's teaching of 'Owe no man anything.' Your prompt payment is expected.

Grant contemplated on the financial strain his family faced due to his father's modest income. His mother, with her practical wisdom, had stretched their budget admirably. Grant pondered seeking help from Uncle Godfrey to clear their debts and give his father a fresh start.

The looming debt to Mr. Tudor risked losing their only local grocery credit. Deacon Gridley, the parish treasurer, had amassed wealth but withheld timely payments to Mr. Thornton, showing little concern for the minister's financial struggles.

Willis Ford was eager to leave the house, worried that Mrs. Estabrook might find out about the missing items before he escaped. Once on the street, he felt relieved. He had enough money to pay his debt and have an extra four hundred dollars. Despite his stepmother's kindness, he only cared about not getting caught. He slyly thought of blaming the new boy, Grant Thornton, for the theft. Willis decided to visit Mrs. Estabrook again to divert suspicion towards Grant. The next morning, Willis met with Jim Morrison and Tom Calder to discuss bonds worth more than his debt.

"""There seems to be a mystery here,"" the broker remarked. ""Morrison gave Grant two bonds to sell, which were identified as belonging to my housekeeper. How did he come to possess them? That is the question.""

""Please refrain from jumping to conclusions, Mrs. Estabrook,"" Mr. Reynolds advised. ""The culprit who took the bonds will likely be revealed. Meanwhile, your losses will be partly compensated as Grant has the money from selling most of them.""

Grant felt overwhelmed when he found a key in his pocket that fit the housekeeper's drawer. He realized the damning evidence against him, yet he knew he was innocent. The thought of Mr. Reynolds believing him guilty was distressing.

""I believe the evidence is compelling,"" Ford interjected. ""Grant had the bonds, sold some, holds the money, and possesses a key that opens the drawer where the bonds were stored.""

Mr. Reynolds assured Mrs. Estabrook that he would cover her losses due to the missing bonds. He promised to investigate the matter, shrouded in mystery, to put her mind at ease.

""Grant, please join me for some questions,"" Mr. Reynolds requested.

"Dear Father,

I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to write to you sooner, but I had no opportunity until now. A man named Willis Ford convinced me to go with him, claiming you had sent for me. He took me on a ship where he made me fall asleep with a handkerchief. When I woke up, we were at sea. I do not know where we went, but eventually, we arrived in a small town in Illinois with the Bartons. Mr. Barton is often drunk, and Mrs. Barton works hard. Their son Abner is kind to me and wants to go to New York. He suggested running away if we had money for train tickets. I long to return home, and if you could send money for our fares, Abner and I would leave immediately. Please help us.

Your son,
Herbert"|"6. What is the tone of the letter?

Day after day, Herbert and Abner visited the post office, hoping for letters that never arrived. Herbert felt desolate, wondering if his father had forgotten him. Additionally, the lack of payment for Herbert's board at the Bartons' home added to his discontent. The boys, Herbert and Abner, sneaked out to check for mail. Abner, showing kindness, shared his bread with Herbert. As they journeyed, a kind man in a wagon offered them a ride. After a long walk, they rested and enjoyed a hearty breakfast. Despite the challenges, Herbert found himself surprisingly hungry after their walk. They continued their journey, covering twenty miles and spending the night in a farmer's barn. Despite the hardships, Herbert slept deeply and felt rejuvenated.|"1. What were Herbert and Abner hoping for at the post office?

"Dear Grant,

I am writing to you through Miss Stone's help as I did not hear back from Papa after writing to him from Scipio, Illinois. Mr. Ford took me out West and left me with a poor family. Abner, Mr. Barton's son, was kind and planned to run away with me to New York. We waited for Papa's help but decided to escape on our own. Dr. Stone and his sister are caring for me now.
