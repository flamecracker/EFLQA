The old and mismatched furniture in Janice's uncle's home was a sight to behold. Despite the shaky chair, toppling bureau, and scratched washstand, it was the bed with only three legs and a soap-box propping up the fourth corner that raised eyebrows.

This scenario was a common occurrence in the Day household, where repairs were only made when absolutely necessary. Janice also observed her cousin Marty, a carefree and idle teenager, and felt doubtful about his future. Despite the dilapidated surroundings, Janice tried to remain positive, suggesting other activities she could do in the garden.

Janice was silently shaking her head, acknowledging the likelihood of Marty's words. Marty's persistence made her willing to abandon the carrot patch.

Walking alongside Marty through the barnyard and paddock, it was evident Marty was right about the neglected horses' coats and the poor cow's condition. Janice refrained from suggesting repairs to Marty, as neglect and decay were evident all around the farm. The climb through the pasture and woodlot was delightful, and the sound of falling water delighted Janice. However, Marty expressed the challenges of working on rocky farms. Inside the house, Aunt 'Mira was busy with supper despite the unwashed dishes. Janice changed into a fresh frock and sat by the window, the loose rocker clicking as she swung back and forth.|"1.

The Union Sunday School had a library, but it faced similar criticisms like many other institutions of its kind. In Polktown, what was truly needed was a space for the village's youth to read and engage in recreational activities. The concept of a club-room for reading and games had to originate from the boys themselves, with minimal adult interference. An empty store on High Street was identified as a potential location for this room. To furnish it, a long table, small tables, a desk, shelves for books, lamps, a stove, chairs, and curtains were required. Janice Day sought Elder Concannon's help to cover the rent for the first three months. Despite initial reluctance due to concerns about the behavior of the local boys, the old minister eventually agreed to support the initiative.|"1.
