Gibraltar's harbor is small but could once hold a large fleet securely within its confines.

However, modern threats from the heights of Algeciras in Spain, just seven miles away, pose a risk. If Spain or another power controlled these heights, they could dominate Gibraltar's harbor. Despite this, Gibraltar's strong military history endures. In a different scenario, American officers faced a mix-up during a dramatic incident involving stolen government papers and a secret code.

The distance to the middle of North Channel was calculated to be around fifteen miles. The plan was for the yacht not to spot them during daylight. At night, the two launches would come closer, with Whyte serving as the pilot. Ensign Dave, equipped with night glasses, monitored the British launch's movements to adjust his course. Ropes with grappling hooks were thrown, securing the yacht's rail. Sailormen climbed aboard, and rope ladders were set up. Dave and his crew swiftly boarded the yacht. While exploring below deck, Dave suspected the skipper might only have a few crew members. Despite the tense situation, Dave remained calm and focused. With heightened senses, Dave noticed a peculiar disturbance in the water, which turned out to be a periscope rising to the surface.|"1. What was the distance to the middle of North Channel?

Darrin's signal had been acknowledged by both fleets, indicating that the submarine had been spotted. The agreed-upon signal of three blue rockets had been sent. Runkle, manning the gun, received the range from Ensign Darrin. After firing, Runkle anxiously watched the water for the splash to gauge his accuracy. The searchlight illuminated the target as Runkle maintained his focus. Despite his excellent gunnery skills, Darrin observed Runkle's frustration at missing the target. It was crucial to sink the submarine promptly. Darrin considered following the bubbles to track the enemy but ultimately had to slow down due to lack of visibility. As the Navy launch continued cautiously, Darrin strategized with his crew to prevent the submarine from doubling back undetected. Despite some missed shots, the crew remained determined to locate and neutralize the submarine.|"1.
