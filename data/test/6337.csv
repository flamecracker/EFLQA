The lieutenant explained that submarines have advantages like speed, protection from torpedo boats, and a weak periscope. He mentioned that torpedo nets are a defense, but submarines have tools to cut through them. Submarines can dive deep, stay submerged for long periods, and use tanks to control buoyancy. The lieutenant warned of an impending attack on a British battleship by Captain Von Cromp. The submarine's engine room was underwater, and the vessel was ready to engage. As the X-9 sped towards its target, the night was dark and stormy, making visibility poor. The captain strained to see through the darkness as the submarine approached the unsuspecting battleship. The scene was tense with the sound of the motor and water splashing against the sides.|"5. What added to the tension in the scene described in the text?

Two boys aboard a submarine heard signals, signaling the vessel's readiness for action. The crew prepared by securing the flagpole, folding part of the bridge, adjusting the periscope, and sealing the entrance. The submarine was about to submerge as the gasoline motors stopped, and electricity took over. Lieutenant Stein, near the boys, observed a British ship through the periscope. The sailors readied themselves near the torpedoes as the interior lit up dimly. The stale smell of oil lingered, making communication difficult due to engine noise and water sounds. The officer monitored the torpedoes closely, and the crew watched the signboard for orders. Despite the storm's impact, the submarine was rocked by the water's motion. The crew prepared to launch torpedoes, prompting thoughts of resistance from the boys, quickly dismissed as futile.|"1. What were the crew's preparations before submerging the submarine?

As the tense moments passed, the boys, Frank and Jack, along with the German officer, awaited the outcome. The first command vanished, and a new one appeared, prompting both boys to act. In a rush of bravery, they leaped towards the officer as he released the first torpedo. The torpedo shot out, setting its course towards its target. The officer, startled by their actions, attempted to stop them, but Jack swiftly struck him. The boys were then ordered to their cabin. Meanwhile, another torpedo was loaded into the tube. Under the water's silence, they anxiously counted the distance. Suddenly, the submarine jerked violently, causing chaos on board. The lieutenant, understanding their motives, offered them fresh air on the bridge. The boys quickly hid their weapons, ready for whatever came next.|"1.

A short while later, the boys found the small boat above water, hidden from view of the German on the bridge. They managed to release it unseen. Frank then prepared an explosive on the periscope of the submarine. He acknowledged the risks but felt the Germans deserved it. After firing the revolver to detonate the explosive, the submarine was obliterated, leaving only debris. The violent explosion caused the sea to churn furiously. No survivors were visible.

Jack's initial concern was for the small boat he had left behind, now seen floating upside down about a hundred yards away. Swimming swiftly towards it, he encountered another person in the water. Together, they managed to right the boat and climb aboard, feeling wet and weak. Looking back at the German submarine wreckage, Jack realized they needed to navigate carefully due to potential floating mines. Using their coats and some string, they improvised a sail to catch the breeze. Exhausted, Jack soon fell asleep in the boat while Frank kept watch for passing ships. Eventually, a British cruiser approached and rescued them. The captain offered them spots on board as midshipmen, which they gladly accepted, settling into their new quarters on the ship.|"1.

For a few days, the boys were given a break from their duties by Captain Marcus to recover from their intense encounter with the submarine.
