Mr. George decided to ignore the persistent commissioner and focused on chatting with Rollo while walking. The commissioner tried to attract their attention by listing places to visit, but when they showed no interest, he left. Soon, a beggar approached, asking for alms. Though Mr. George usually avoided giving to street beggars, the beggar followed them until Rollo discreetly slipped a small copper coin into his cap. Rollo, familiar with Swiss coins, was unsure if his uncle would approve, but he believed in honesty. As they continued, another commissioner offered help, but Mr. George declined politely. The narrow streets of Cologne posed a challenge, with carriages passing through tight spaces originally meant for pedestrians. The travelers finally reached a square where the ancient cathedral stood, its weathered facade covered in greenery, a testament to nature's resilience on old structures.|"1.

Long ago, chieftains often fought wars, with the weaker ones eventually falling under the rule of the stronger. This led to the merging of small territories into larger ones. As these amalgamations progressed, life for farmers and merchants improved as rules for tax collection became more stable. A system of law developed, promoting industry and public order. Eventually, many petty chieftains united under one ruler, forming a kingdom where descendants lived off the labor of others through taxes and rents. In contrast, America allows individuals to keep the fruits of their labor, with contributions made for public welfare. Along the Rhine River, old castles fell into disuse as rules replaced violence for collecting tribute. Some castles became fortresses, while others became summer homes.

The Rhine region features the Sieben Gebirgen, known as the Seven Mountains, with the highest peak being Drachenfels, boasting a ruined castle and an inn for travellers. Situated on the east bank of the river, these mountains mark the beginning of the Rhine's mountainous terrain when journeying from Cologne. Opposite on the left bank are more striking mountains with renowned ruins. The river flows between these highlands like a gateway.

Mr. George left Rollo to set off on his donkey alone, disappearing among the grapevines. The boy whipped the donkey to start their journey up the steep path, making it hard for Rollo to stay seated.

Rollo reached a pavilion with his uncle, offering a breathtaking view of the river. They rested and then continued up to a grassy mound where they saw a single ancient arch made of durable basalt. The arch seemed to be a window or door, standing as a reminder of the past. After exploring the ruin, they descended the hill, with Rollo walking down to avoid falling from the donkey.|"1.

Rollo walked to the riverbank, removed his shoes and socks, and dipped his feet in the water. As he relaxed, a large boat pulled by horses passed by.

The steamboat has departed up the river, leaving them behind. On the shore, there are several small boats with boatmen waiting to be hired. I plan to ask Uncle George if I can sail in one of them on Monday. I observe the students through my spyglass from above. They sit under the trees on the terrace, wearing peculiar caps, smoking pipes, and enjoying drinks. Down below, a man is having supper on the parapet by the road. A girl, likely his daughter, brings him food and drink. A raft approaches, manned by twenty-two people with large oars, rowing to steer the raft.

Two women and a man rowed a boat to Nuns' Island. As they landed, the women headed towards the nunnery while the man secured the boat. Meanwhile, students gathered on the landing, possibly preparing to return to Bonn in small boats. Dusk approached, signaling it was time to head home. The students crowded into a few boats, risking tipping them over. Drifting into the current, the students' boats, adorned with flags, moved swiftly without much rowing. Despite some attempting to sing, the boats got tangled up, causing laughter and commotion. A carriage with four students, two looking unwell, slowly passed by. The other two seemed fine and likely cared for the sick ones. The next morning, Mr. George and Rollo read from the book of Acts in a bower with a beautiful view, discussing the apostles' efforts to spread Christianity.|"1.

Mr. George explained the significance of the communion ceremony to Rollo. During the service, the priest consecrates the bread and wine, believing they transform into the body and blood of Christ.

The assistant assists in the ceremony, ensuring the proper handling of the consecrated elements. The priest then carefully drinks the wine, symbolizing the blood of Christ, in three portions.

The people living along the Rhine River have taken great care to maintain and restore the old castles that dot the landscape. Some castles have been meticulously preserved over the years, while others that fell into disrepair have been renovated and rebuilt to their former glory. These strongholds now serve various purposes, from being used as fortresses by state governors to serving as summer retreats for private individuals. One notable castle along the Rhine is Ehrenbreitstein, a formidable fortress strategically located at the confluence of the Rhine and Moselle rivers near the town of Coblenz. The Romans established a town at this pivotal location, known as Confluentes, which eventually evolved into Coblenz. The town sits on a triangular piece of land where both rivers meet, connected by stone and boat bridges. Rollo, intrigued by the engineering marvel of the boat bridge, observed how sections could be detached and moved to allow passage for boats. During a visit to the impressive Castle of Ehrenbreitstein, Rollo and Mr. George marveled at the massive fortifications and enjoyed a breathtaking view of the surrounding rivers and landscapes from the castle's esplanade.|"1.

Rollo explored the barracks and climbed to the top of the buildings at Ehrenbreitstein. The roofs were arched and covered in earth to protect against enemy bombs.

The furnished rooms displayed relics from feudal times, with polished oak floors requiring visitors to wear felt slippers.

We visited the Catholic church with a huge old gallery on one side and an organ in a loft. The church had ancient statues and images, making it look very old. Walking through the pathways, we could see green rocks and mountains towering over the town, adorned with grapevines and bushes. Nearby, up a steep path, lies the massive ruin of Rheinfels, visible from my window. Uncle George and I saw it from the outside, as the entrance was locked. Legend has it that the French destroyed it with gunpowder to prevent its use by enemies. A man played the trumpet by the river, creating echoes among the rocks. The area felt gloomy due to the deep gorge and crumbling castles. Uncle George planned to stay to write, finding the quiet and economical setting suitable.|"1.

The massive rafts on the river are left to float downstream by the current, with men at each end using oars to keep the raft centered. The rowing only serves to move the raft sideways. Rollo was puzzled by the sight of the men rowing vigorously without any oars along the sides. He soon grasped the concept as he observed the raft's movement. When the front of the raft approached him, Rollo boarded it from a boat. The top of the raft was a smooth floor made of boards, elevated above the water. Rollo saw the underwater structure made of large logs and timbers covered with a board flooring. Houses were situated in the middle of the raft, with women and children around. The women, speaking German, were curious about America and engaged Rollo in conversation. The captain welcomed Rollo and allowed him to stay on the raft until he signaled to go ashore.|"1.

There were many things to capture Rollo's attention, initially diverting him from his loneliness. A fire burned on the raft, near a house's door. Rollo discovered the fire was on a sand hearth, contained in a box. A screen shielded the fire from the wind. Rollo then explored the captain's platform, elevated for a commanding view. The raftsmen rowed with massive oars, six men to each. Rollo observed their synchronized movements, akin to a military maneuver. As a steamer passed, waves crashed against the raft's edge. Tourists aboard the steamer used spy glasses and enjoyed breakfast. The steamer swiftly sailed away, leaving behind a foamy wake.|"1. What initially diverted Rollo's attention from his loneliness?

After the steamboat passed, Rollo felt lonely on the raft, surrounded by dark mountains. The raft drifted slowly into a scary gorge. Rollo, with a hundred men who looked like brigands, felt helpless. He wished to be on shore. Looking down the river, he saw the town disappearing behind trees. Rollo decided to leave the raft and go back to the boat. The captain quickly arranged for him to be rowed ashore. Rollo gave the oarsman some money and started his way home. Feeling embarrassed to return so soon, he decided to fish by the river to make his absence seem longer.

Mr. George explained how the River Rhine uses its upper branches for timber growth, which is then cut down and floated downstream to Holland and Belgium. In the lower areas, the land is used for farming grain and flax due to its flat terrain. Unlike America with its abundant forests, every inch of European land has been utilized for over two thousand years. Europeans carefully manage their land for the most profitable use, whether for agriculture, vineyards, or timber. The steady flow of the river aids in transporting goods downstream. A steamer with an engine capable of twelve miles per hour in still water would travel fourteen miles downstream and ten miles upstream in a river flowing at two miles per hour. Despite the appearance of equal help and hindrance, the current's effect is different over a given distance due to the time spent navigating against it.|"1.

Mr. George explained how river currents can impact the navigation of boats. He illustrated this using the example of a steamer traveling on a river flowing at two miles per hour. The steamer took three hours to go downstream and four hours to return upstream. Mr. George emphasized that for navigation in both directions, the current is a disadvantage. However, for one-way navigation like rafts coming downstream, the current is a great advantage. He concluded that the flow of water in rivers can be beneficial as there is usually more cargo coming downstream than going upstream. Mr. George and Rollo then enjoyed their meal, discussing honesty and openness in their interactions. Mr. George shared how he had discreetly arranged for Rollo's safety during a recent expedition, intending to inform him later, but Rollo felt it was a little artful.|"1.

B) It is always an advantage for navigation
C) It is beneficial for downstream navigation only
D) It is beneficial for upstream navigation only
E) It has no impact on navigation"|C) It is beneficial for downstream navigation only|C
Mr. George explained how river currents can impact the navigation of boats. He illustrated this using the example of a steamer traveling on a river flowing at two miles per hour. The steamer took three hours to go downstream and four hours to return upstream. Mr. George emphasized that for navigation in both directions, the current is a disadvantage. However, for one-way navigation like rafts coming downstream, the current is a great advantage. He concluded that the flow of water in rivers can be beneficial as there is usually more cargo coming downstream than going upstream. Mr. George and Rollo then enjoyed their meal, discussing honesty and openness in their interactions. Mr. George shared how he had discreetly arranged for Rollo's safety during a recent expedition, intending to inform him later, but Rollo felt it was a little artful.|"6.

Mr. George and Rollo had a pleasant evening on the Rhine. They landed at Bingen, a town with a floating pier. The pier, built on a boat anchored in the river, ensured a steady platform for passengers to disembark. The town was nestled between the Rhine and the Nahe rivers, much like Coblenz. As they approached, Mr. George shared a story from the guidebook about a man who mistreated poor people. Once ashore, porters swiftly handled their baggage, and the duo settled into a cozy hotel room. Rollo admired the steep vineyard-covered banks across the river, known for producing excellent grapes like those from Rudesheim and Johannisberg. The terraced fields stretched for miles, divided by walls and paths, with watchtowers dotting the landscape. Laborers lived in villages along the shore, tending to the vines and harvesting the grapes.|"1. What type of town is Bingen?
