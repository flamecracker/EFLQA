Surprisingly, upon realizing his eyes were missing, he vigorously hurled himself into another bush and managed to scratch them back in place. In a playful rhyme, we recount the tale of catching a fish alive, only to release it after it nipped the little finger on the right.

The bells of St. Helen's claim, ""You owe me a debt."" Old Bailey's bells inquire, ""When will you settle yet?"" Shoreditch's bells ask, ""When wealth do you foresee?"" Stepney's bells query, ""When will that be?"" The grand Bell of Bow admits, ""I do not know."" Whitechapel's bells chime, ""Two sticks in an apple show.""

St. Peter's bells claim, ""Old shoes and slippers we share."" St. John's bells intone, ""Pokers and tongs we declare."" Jenny Wren sat by her shed, Her tail wagged, her head bobbed. Asked a man, ""Where are you off to, my pretty maid?"" ""Milking,"" she said, and he asked to aid. ""What does your father do, my pretty maid?"" ""A farmer,"" she said, unafraid.
