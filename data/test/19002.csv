Alice found herself in a peculiar situation. She decided to kick down the chimney to confront an animal she thought was Bill. A series of voices arose, suggesting to burn the house down. Alice threatened to set Dinah, her pet, on them. She then shrank in size and fled the house, encountering a group of animals outside. One of the animals was a little green lizard named Bill. Alice ran into a nearby wood to figure out how to reach a beautiful garden. As she pondered, an enormous puppy appeared, and Alice tried to play with it using a stick. The puppy joyfully engaged in the play, causing Alice to dodge around a thistle to avoid getting trampled. Despite the puppy's size, Alice found it endearing and wished she could teach it tricks. She then realized she needed to grow back to her normal size but was unsure how to achieve this transformation.|"1. What did Alice do when she found herself in a peculiar situation?

Let me share a delightful story with you, my dear friend, to brighten your Easter. Imagine waking up on a summer morning, hearing birds chirping, feeling a gentle breeze, and seeing the world through half-closed eyes. It's a dreamy feeling, almost sad yet beautiful, like a painting or poem that brings tears to your eyes. As you wake, it's as if a mother's hand draws back the curtains and her voice calls you to rise and embrace the day. Do you think God only wants us to be serious on Sundays? I believe He enjoys our innocent laughter and joy every day. So, let's not divide life into solemn and carefree parts. Let's cherish innocent amusements like this story and remember that a brighter dawn awaits us all one day. Enjoy the sunlight, dear child, and may this Easter fill you with life and hope.|"1.
