The Virginia that the three ships from England were sailing towards in the 16th and early 17th centuries was a vast land stretching from cold, fur-bearing animal lands to warm regions with canebrakes, figs, magnolias, chameleons, and mockingbirds. Initially, cartographers believed North America to be narrow, like an extended Central America, with huge rivers possibly being estuaries. As contact and experience increased, the understanding of Virginia changed. By the end of the 17th century, the northern part became known by different names, while to the west, it seemed to expand as the South Sea and Cathay faded into the distance. The Virginia they encountered was a country of moderate climate, rich soil, great rivers, and stunning landscapes from mountains to marshes, offering mineral wealth, water power, and fertile land for agriculture. This Virginia, not the gold-rich land they initially envisioned, became the goal of the Susan Constant, the Goodspeed, and the Discovery.|"1.

Virginia was founded and established by English people who moved through forests, crossed shining waters in boats, and lived in hamlets built of wood. The climate and nature were different from England, but the settlers came from Middlesex, Surrey, Devon, and other English shires. Scotchmen, Welshmen, Irish, Poles, Germans, and French vinedressers also arrived. Political and economic life was developing, with tobacco becoming a major crop shaping customs and habits. The rich soil, fertile from layers of decaying forests, allowed for abundant tobacco growth. Laborers were needed, and indentured men were brought in to work the fields. Land ownership and cultivation practices in Virginia mirrored those of England, but with larger individual holdings due to seemingly endless land. Industries like glass works, iron works, and agriculture flourished, with tobacco overshadowing other crops. Governor Yeardley was succeeded by Sir Francis Wyatt in 1621, who brought literary figures like George Sandys, the first literary man of the English New World, to Virginia. Literature from Virginia, including works by Smith, Percy, Strachey, Hamor, and Whitaker, reflected the strength and style of Elizabethan and Jacobean writing.|"1.

In 1644, during the Marston Moor battle, Virginia faced its own conflict. Opechancanough, an aged leader, unleashed a surprise attack on the outlying settlements, resulting in the deaths of hundreds.

In 1635, the first Assembly in Maryland met with Leonard Calvert and his Council alongside the burgesses to create laws. These laws were sent to the Lord Proprietary for approval, but due to long voyages and slow procedures, his veto did not reach Maryland until 1637.

During the civil war in England, sentiments in Maryland leaned towards the King. Disorder arose in Maryland, with a Puritan ship causing trouble and an insurrection led by Richard Ingle. Leonard Calvert had to flee, but upon his return with support from Virginia, Ingle was forced to retreat.

Berkeley's influence was evident in the actions of the Assembly.

At a crucial moment, Bacon became ill and passed away. Some believed he was poisoned, but this was never proven. The illness that struck him during his time in Jamestown and persisted after his victory appears to have been the cause of his death.

In the past, a King, known for his good nature, commented on Berkeley, a zealous man who governed Virginia. The King criticized Berkeley for hanging more people than he did for the murder of his father. Berkeley's harsh actions led to a rebellion in Virginia.

In Maryland, troubles brewed even before the death of Cecil Calvert. Corruption seeped into public offices, mirroring Virginia's woes.

The specter of insurrection faded, but challenges persisted for the third Lord Baltimore. Encroachments by the Dutch and Englishman William Penn added to Maryland's woes. The Protestant majority in Maryland opposed the Catholic Proprietary's rule, setting the stage for political and religious clashes. The Revolution of 1688 marked a turning point, pitting Protestants against Catholic leadership in Maryland.|"1. What is one similarity between Maryland and Virginia during this time period?

In Maryland, life mirrored that of Virginia, with rural plantations and farms connected by challenging roads or waterways. Planters' homes overlooked the water, surrounded by outbuildings, cabins for laborers, and fields of crops like corn, wheat, and tobacco. Artisans among laborers provided goods like furniture and clothing, while ships from England brought other necessities and luxuries. Virginia's settlers looked south to vast, unexplored lands called South Virginia, later known as Carolina. In 1653, settlers like Roger Green moved into the region, seeking new opportunities and freedom from persecution. These pioneers lived in isolated cabins, farming, hunting, and trading with Native Americans, fostering independence but lacking social interaction. This area eventually became North Carolina, a rugged land of forests, streams, and a unique way of life.|"1. What types of crops were grown on planters' farms in Maryland and Virginia?

In 1669, the Lords Proprietaries sent three ships from England with about a hundred colonists aboard to establish a settlement in Carolina. Unfortunately, the Albemarle was wrecked by a storm near Barbados, and the Port Royal was destroyed by a hurricane near the Bahamas. Despite these setbacks, the Carolina ship, along with a Barbados sloop, safely reached Bermuda before heading to Port Royal, South Carolina. The colonists decided to settle between the Ashley and Cooper rivers, founding Charles Town. Over the years, more colonists arrived from places like Barbados, England, Scotland, Ireland, France, and Germany, increasing the population.

South Carolina initially experimented with tobacco and wheat, but a bag of Madagascar rice left by a ship at Charleston in the late 17th century changed everything. The rice thrived in the low-lying lands, becoming the staple crop. African slaves were brought in for the rice fields, leading to the rise of large plantations and an aristocratic society. Unlike Virginia, where planters lived on their own land, South Carolina planters resided in Charleston, leaving employees to manage their vast estates. The plantation system in South Carolina, with its extensive use of slaves, differed significantly from the more communal life in Virginia. The Carolinas also welcomed individuals seeking religious freedom, fostering a diverse and evolving society. In North Carolina, a mix of immigrants, including Huguenots, Swiss, Germans, and Scots, shaped a hardworking and freedom-loving agricultural community.|"1.

"In the late 1600s, Virginia and South Carolina had distinct characteristics. South Carolina boasted grand plantations and a refined town society with a sophisticated clergy and aristocratic lifestyle. Initially, colonial life in both North and South was concentrated near the coast and rivers. Over time, English settlers expanded inland, reaching the hills and eventually crossing the mountains.

In Virginia, a Scottish clergyman named Dr. James Blair held an influential position in the Council due to his role as Commissioner of the Established Church. He envisioned establishing a college in Virginia, which was supported by local planters eager to educate their sons. With subscriptions from the planters and additional funds collected in England with the help of influential figures like Archbishop of Canterbury Tillotson and Bishop of Worcester Stillingfleet, Blair secured a charter for the college. The construction of the college, named William and Mary, began in Williamsburg. Many notable figures, including three American Presidents and signers of the Declaration of Independence, were educated at William and Mary. As the seventeenth century drew to a close, the colonies, including Virginia, felt the impact of the ongoing conflict between France and England, leading to heightened vigilance and preparations for defense.

The area also had offices, committee rooms, and prisons. The Governor's House hosted grand events like Birth-Nights and balls. While Virginians were mainly country dwellers, villages and hamlets began to form around county Court Houses. The colony had over twenty settled counties, with vast frontier counties extending to the mountains. The Appalachians acted as a barrier, keeping Virginians along the seaboard.

Spotswood, a practical man, founded the Order of the Knights of the Horseshoe, but his real legacy was the Vision of the West. He encouraged settlers to move from the coast to the Piedmont region, where new counties like Spotsylvania and King George were named in his and the sovereign's honor. German craftsmen settled in Spotswood's estate, leading to the creation of Germanna. After retiring as Governor in 1722, Spotswood became the deputy Postmaster-General for the colonies. He even appointed Benjamin Franklin as the Postmaster for Philadelphia. Although he died before sailing to Cartagena in 1740, his influence lived on. Lawrence Washington, who joined the expedition, later named his estate after Admiral Vernon. This era marked the transition from colonial Virginia to the revolutionary period.

In 1732, James Oglethorpe led over a hundred Georgia settlers aboard the Anne, a ship that set sail from England. They landed in Charles Town, South Carolina, where they were warmly welcomed. After a brief rest, they continued their journey south to the mouth of the Savannah River. Oglethorpe and a select group scouted the area and chose a beautiful spot on Yamacraw Bluff to establish their town, Savannah. They built a town and soon more settlers arrived, including German Protestants and Moravians. Oglethorpe also brought Tomochi-chi, the chief of the Yamacraws, to England to garner support for the growing colony. As tensions rose with Spain, Oglethorpe recruited Scottish Highlanders to bolster the defenses of the settlement, leading to the establishment of New Inverness and Darien in Georgia.|"1.
