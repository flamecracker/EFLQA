"Mr. Williams, determined to find a way to raise wind, used his creativity. He built a box with a valve at the bottom to let air in and a hole in the front to let it out. A piston helped force the air out. By using a lever to raise the piston and weights to push it down, he created a continuous blast of wind. Natives helped operate the contraption. They worked admirably, but there were some issues like sucking in fire and long intervals between blasts. To fix this, Mr. Williams made another box to work alternately with the first. The natives also helped in making planks, spinning twine from tree bark, and constructing a vessel named _The Messenger of Peace_. Despite temptations to escape, he stayed true to his promise, whispering ""honour bright"" to himself."|"1. What did Mr. Williams build to raise wind?
