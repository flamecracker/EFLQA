In the classroom that afternoon, history recitations were interrupted by a sudden shriek as Nick Pell leaped from his seat and fled from his desk, startled by a snake. The boys reacted differently, some believing it was real, others suspecting a trick. The teacher cautiously approached the desk armed with a ruler, only to have the snake hiss and strike. Tom threw a book, hitting the snake, and chaos ensued as the boys hurled objects until the snake was cornered. Dick finally subdued it with a geography book. Meanwhile, Nick collapsed, prompting urgent calls for medical help. Doctor Fremley arrived and attended to Nick, leaving with a grave expression. Dick then confessed the events leading up to the snake incident, implicating Tad Sobber. The discovery of Sobber's compositions added to the mystery, causing him to flee the school.|"1.
