On Monday morning, Carl departed from Milford and arrived in New York after a two-and-a-half-hour journey. Following Mr. Jennings' guidance, he secured passage and a stateroom on a luxurious Hudson River steamer bound for Albany. Although the vessel was crowded, Carl managed to secure a fine room by acting promptly. As he settled in, he savored the scenic beauty along the Hudson, relishing his first long trip. Reflecting on his progress from a year ago when he left home with little to his name, Carl appreciated his current situation. Later that night, Carl retired to his stateroom with a newfound friend, Mr. Stuyvesant, who unexpectedly absconded with Carl's valise and wallet while he slept.
