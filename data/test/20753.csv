John returned to the wagon and picked up the second gun automatically. The Professor comforted him, then went back out. This time, he boldly walked towards the edge of the clearing.

The Professor hinted that John might be developing a dual personality due to memory loss and a new beginning. The boys were left pondering the significance of memory and its role in defining humanity. The group decided on a cautious approach as they faced an increasing besieging force, knowing they couldn't ford the wide rivers surrounding them.

During the early evening, the Professor devised a clever plan to outsmart the savages. He proposed building a raft from logs to help the yaks carry the wagon across the river. With John's help, they gathered driftwood and constructed a small raft. Quietly, they cut logs further away to avoid detection. They floated the logs down the river, tied them to the raft, and poled it across. The yaks were then yoked up and led to the river. Harry and the team worked together to float the wagon on the logs. The Professor and George disguised the wagon to deceive the savages. With Harry's guidance, the yaks successfully crossed the river, and the group moved inland to throw off the enemy's pursuit. Tired but relieved, they found a hiding spot to rest and keep an eye on their foes.|"1. What did the Professor propose to help the yaks carry the wagon across the river?

The boys were surprised by the sudden news. The low ammunition due to intense fighting made them see the wisdom in the decision. As the yaks headed north, the chief's warning glance was ignored, later proving significant. Traveling over rough terrain, the team moved slowly. Approaching small huts, the party was noticed by the tribal village. The locals appeared different and armed. The Professor noticed the lack of ammunition among the villagers and their unconventional use of firearms. The villagers attacked with arrows, prompting the party to defend themselves. The warriors fled after being outmatched. The boys, John, and the Professor chased them, reaching a large hut. Inside, they celebrated, mimicking the savages' cries.

Yes, I was going to mention that. We were hungry and walked along the shoreline, then moved inland where we found unfamiliar vegetables and berries. We ate quickly but later heard voices and saw a group of nearly naked savages dragging a captive. We were terrified. These savages have distinguishing features like a row of shells and colored bands, along with dark brown hair. They capture enemies for their hair to make head ornaments. We traveled west from the mountains, resting by a stream. We fell ill from berries, then found nuts and sweet potatoes. We lost track of time, distance, and direction, aiming to go north but ended up south. We evaded capture for months, stumbling upon a savage camp sacrificing a victim, which might have been a captive from another tribe. Sacrifices occur at specific times, and we feared the unknown fate that awaited us.|"1. What did the group of nearly naked savages use to make head ornaments?

The teacher interrupted, explaining how different cultures commemorate events historically. For instance, the Israelites kept a brazen serpent as a memory in the ark. In early church times, memories were celebrated. The narrative then shifted to a daring escape by captives who evaded enemies but faced starvation. Desperate for food, they entered a village, which led to capture. However, a transformation in their appearance postponed their sacrifice due to the natives' superstitions. The captives were treated kindly, given liberty, and eventually escaped. They encountered a different tribe and boldly demanded food, surprising them with a watch that caused fear and led to a feast. The captives were welcomed by the tribe, given bows and arrows, and integrated into their group. Yet, they were eventually captured by hostile forces, narrowly escaping sacrifice.|"1.

To explain the distance between the moon and a fixed star, drawings of the sky are essential. The first sketch, Fig. 13, depicts the northern hemisphere, while the second, Fig. 14, shows the southern hemisphere. Fixed stars are named and categorized by magnitude. The loss of a boat at South River had troubled Harry and George, prompting a plan to recover it with the Professor's support. However, repairing the damaged boat for a journey seemed impractical due to the extent of damage. Despite this setback, the group prepared for a hunting trip with guns, ammunition, spears, and bolos. As they journeyed, they made good progress, covering about forty to fifty miles in two days. A sudden encounter with an animal led to a swift response and a surprising turn of events.|"1.

The savages were in a frenzy, causing Ralph and Tom confusion. They decided on a plan: pretend to retreat west, then head north to cross the river and hurry home. Harry suggested two stay back to mislead the savages while the rest crossed the river. Ralph and Harry volunteered to stay back. The group, with the wagon, went north, circled east, and reached the river. They hid, gathered driftwood, and crossed the river. They recognized the trail, which was rough. They traveled about fifteen miles by night, straining the animals and wagon. They rested briefly, continued at dawn, and reached the forest edge by evening. They felt relieved but stayed vigilant. The group evaded the savages, pleased with their escape. The Professor was understanding about losing the boat. George tried to navigate using stars but needed more practice.

John welcomed them back, while Chief, observing, extended a friendly hand. Chief's curiosity and learning process intrigued the group. His interest in tools and the workshop, especially the grindstone, delighted him.

They had reached the recess, and George suggested examining the entire cave, with Ralph leading the way. The calcareous deposit covered everything in white. Near the chests with copper vessels, a stark contrast emerged. After carefully replacing the coins, Harry proposed further exploration. He moved right, Tom and the boys following closely. At the spot where the Professor had placed them, five skeletons appeared, shocking the group. The skeletons, some with knives in their ribs and one with a bullet in the skull, presented a horrifying sight. The group had left the skeletons, treasure, and weapons untouched in the cave's other part, never informing the Professor of their secret visit. As they moved around a wall, a strange sound from the second chamber startled them. A hollow laugh followed by two hearty laughs greeted them as the Professor and John emerged. John praised the boys' bravery against unseen enemies. Later, John shared details about another cave with hidden treasure, leading to further discussions.|"1.

The concept of gravity was demonstrated through an experiment involving hanging objects of different weights. By suspending three objects from a wire between two walls, the effects of gravity were observed. The objects hung closer to the walls at the top than at the bottom due to the gravitational pull. The setup allowed for a clear visualization of the gravitational forces at play. The passage also describes the preparation for a practical test involving a raft below a waterfall. The raft was assembled and tested for stability in the water. The characters in the story were getting ready for a journey through the forest, emphasizing the importance of caution and preparation before embarking on an adventure.|"4. What was the purpose of testing the stability of the raft in the water?

The group journeyed near a river, camping for the night. In the morning, they decided to navigate away from a rough valley towards a forest. John and Ralph explored the area, suggesting heading south to cross the river or investigate the mountains. They built a raft and ventured forth, finding better terrain. After crossing the river, they made good progress. At night, Angel's unease hinted at danger from wild animals. A scouting party was formed to investigate a nearby campfire, likely left by savages. John led the team cautiously, aiming to intercept the band before nightfall. Despite their efforts, the group didn't encounter the enemy that day. Plans were made to cautiously approach the enemy's camp, ensuring to maintain a safe distance.|"1.
