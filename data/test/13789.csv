"This project began many years ago when I delved into newspapers and journals from 1860-1865 at the British Museum to study English public opinion during the American Civil War. As a teacher at Stanford University in California, I further explored diplomatic correspondence between Great Britain and the United States. While collaborating on a biography of Charles Francis Adams, who served as the American Minister to Great Britain during the Civil War, our work was interrupted by the outbreak of the Great War. In 1920, I resumed my research on ""Great Britain and the American Civil War,"" hoping to access English materials collected by Mr. Adams. Despite restrictions on citing diplomatic archives beyond 1859, I obtained approval to use these materials for my historical work. Studying private papers like the Russell Papers and the Gladstone Papers in England has enriched my research."|"1. What was the initial motivation for the project described in the text?

"None of the interactions between governments significantly impacted British policies towards America. The ""War of 1812,"" known as ""Mr. Madison's War"" in the United States and derisively named by Tory contemporaries in Great Britain, stemmed from serious conflicts where the governments were in clear opposition. It was essentially a clash between belligerent and neutral interests. Britain initially fought to preserve Europe from French revolutionary influence, later against Napoleon's Empire plan. The dispute with America revolved around blockades, contraband, and the British ""rule of 1756."" The core issue was the British practice of impressment, where they claimed once a person was born a British subject, they could never cease to be one. This led to a clash over citizenship rights and the right of search at sea. The War of 1812 also arose from conflicting maritime and naval interests between America and Britain."|"1.

In American history, the War of 1812 is often seen as a second fight for independence and a crucial battle against Britain's unfair control of the seas. This war was significant as it was one of the few major conflicts the United States engaged in until the Mexican War of 1846. The British perspective, however, was that of a nation fighting a life-and-death struggle against a powerful European enemy. While some in Britain saw an opportunity to crush Napoleon's ambitions, the war was not primarily about the American democratic system for the British government. The peace treaty signed in 1814 at Ghent marked the end of the war, but tensions persisted. The issue of the right of search in times of peace remained a point of contention, with Britain using its navy to combat the African Slave Trade. This disagreement over the right of search continued to strain relations between the two nations, leading to further diplomatic challenges and misunderstandings.|"1.

The dispute over the right of search ended when American power became a significant factor in global policy. American leaders had long envisioned separating the interests of the Western Hemisphere from Europe's. Washington warned against entangling alliances with Europe. Britain, facing French intervention in Spain and Spanish America, proposed a joint declaration with America against French involvement in the Americas. However, America, led by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and President Monroe, preferred a separate declaration. This led to the Monroe Doctrine, opposing European colonization in the Americas. The Doctrine allowed the US to expand its influence. The US population grew rapidly, and as it expanded westward, tensions arose with Britain over American territorial ambitions. The British, reliant on American cotton, were wary of US expansion, especially concerning Texas and slavery.|"1. What event marked the end of the dispute over the right of search?

The fate of Texas was a pivotal point in British policy towards America. Pakenham, the British minister to Mexico, advocated for British pressure on Mexico to prevent the reconquest of Texas and to support Texas in maintaining its independence. The goal was to create a strong Anglo-Saxon state in Texas that would act as a buffer against American expansion to the southwest. Ultimately, the hope was to lead Texas to abolish slavery. Despite tensions, Britain aimed to avoid war with America. The British government's involvement in Texas's fate was met with mixed reactions in America, as it seemed to hinder American expansion. Texas eventually chose to join the United States in 1846 after a decade of independence. The British government's role in this episode was seen as unfavorable by many Americans.|"1.

The goal was to create a strong Anglo-Saxon state in Texas that would act as a buffer against American expansion to the southwest. Ultimately, the hope was to lead Texas to abolish slavery. Despite tensions, Britain aimed to avoid war with America. The British government's involvement in Texas's fate was met with mixed reactions in America, as it seemed to hinder American expansion. Texas eventually chose to join the United States in 1846 after a decade of independence. The British government's role in this episode was seen as unfavorable by many Americans.|"2.

In 1860, the tensions between the governments of the United States and Britain seemed to have eased. The issues of impressment and British expatriation theories had largely been resolved. The right of search in peacetime had been settled by Britain's renunciation in 1858. Disputes over American territorial expansion had subsided since the annexation of Texas. While minor conflicts in Central America were resolved amicably, deeper underlying differences persisted. Commercial ties between the two nations were vital. After gaining independence in 1783, America's commercial relationship with Britain changed. The British colonial system no longer favored American trade. Despite legal restrictions, trade between New England and the British West Indies resumed, although not as profitable as before. The War of 1812 disrupted direct trade with Britain, leading America to develop its own industries. The post-war period saw British merchants flooding the American market with cheap goods, aiming to hinder American manufacturing growth.|"1.

During the early 1800s, British merchants' actions upset American businesses, leading to a call for protection in the United States. The American government, mainly representing agriculture, passed a temporary Tariff Bill in 1816 to cover war expenses. British policy favored colonial expansion, focusing on British North America's maritime provinces and trade with the West Indies. This policy affected American trade, leading to a push for protectionism in the U.S. By 1820, the issue of West Indian trade became a major concern, resulting in political action. Congress retaliated by passing a law in 1818 to restrict British vessels from American ports. This sparked a change in American economic policies, culminating in the Tariff Bill of 1828. The U.S. embraced protectionism, contrasting Britain's move towards free trade. The clash of economic theories and interests between the two nations persisted until 1846 when Britain embraced free trade. Southern cotton interests in the U.S. opposed protectionism, leading to the 1854 reciprocity treaty with British American Provinces. Despite British disapproval of slavery, trade ties with the Southern States grew due to cotton exports and mutual economic interests.|"1.

While criticisms of American social customs were common due to a preference for British ways, there was a fascination with American political ideals and institutions. British emigration to America, especially by laborers seeking better wages and social equality, was fueled by stories of prosperity and democratic living. The British lower class saw America as a land of opportunity and personal happiness, shaping a positive image of the country.

"After 1832, the British governing class shifted from sympathy to a critical view of America, viewing it as a rising nation impacting British prosperity and power. British travelers' books post-1840 focused on American industry and policy rather than political institutions.

From 1830 to 1850, British sentiment against slavery was strong. There was hope that the Northern States in the US would end slavery in the South.

The day may come when conflicting interests weaken the Union, but no one can predict when this might happen. The hidden ties that bind the states together are like invisible threads, keeping the giant man united. Any attempt to unravel these ties only strengthens them. When one state talks of leaving, the others band together. If a foreign nation threatens, the entire Union unites. Thus, in every dangerous situation, there is also safety. Despite talk of dissolution, many believe the Union is secure. The British press viewed the slavery controversy in America as a quarrel between North and South, but not an immediate threat to the Union. The turmoil surrounding Lincoln's election was seen as favourable to anti-slavery, with British newspapers condemning the South's stance. The _Times_ praised Lincoln's election, hoping it would halt the spread of slavery and its domineering influence. Other leading journals echoed similar sentiments, with the _Economist_ attributing Lincoln's victory to a shift in voter sympathies and the _Saturday Review_ expressing caution toward the Republican party's potential actions.

At a distance of three thousand miles, Southern planters were likened to English country gentlemen, fostering kinship with those in England who revered old traditions. This 'Southern gentleman' theory, though partly true, was often discussed by reviewers and London Clubs. However, not all reviews shared this view; the Radical _Westminster_ argued that slavery was the core issue. Lincoln, elected on an anti-slavery platform, focused on preserving the Union rather than abolishing slavery where it existed. Efforts were made for compromise, but as secession loomed, uncertainty grew in Britain regarding American affairs. Some believed British interests could benefit from America's division, causing a shift in British sympathy. The British government, attentive to its interests, was accused of secretly hoping for America's breakup. Yet, amidst the passions of the Civil War, criticism of Britain's stance should be viewed with caution.|"1.

When examining the evidence from official and private diplomatic sources, there is no concrete proof of animosity towards the United States from Lord John Russell and Lord Lyons. The British Minister at Washington, Lord Lyons, maintained impartiality in his reports, even amidst the rising tensions following Lincoln's election. Lord Russell instructed British agents to remain neutral and avoid expressing opinions that could worsen relations with either American faction. The first issue requiring British intervention arose when South Carolina seized the Federal customs house in Charleston. Despite the uncertainty and division between Northern and Southern statesmen, Russell believed that the break-up of the Union was inevitable. He hoped for a peaceful resolution and instructed Lyons to act cautiously to protect British trade interests from the potential consequences of a civil conflict in America.|"1.

Until March 1861, British public and official views did not anticipate armed conflict or a strong Northern effort to reclaim the South. This initial British stance was based on a misunderstanding. As the true situation unfolded, public sentiment shifted away from a united pro-Northern stance towards a more critical view. Some speculated that the Northern States should have seized the opportunity to separate from the South. There were even suggestions that Britain might allow the North to annex Canada for compensation. The _Times_, a prominent British newspaper, shifted its stance as civil war in America loomed. It expressed concerns about the impact of war on British trade and commerce. The paper began to acknowledge the strength of the South and its military capabilities. This change in tone was reflected in other British publications as well. Ultimately, public opinion in Britain was against a war to restore the Union, viewing it as futile.|"1.

In February 1861, during the American Civil War, British statesmen faced a dilemma over their governmental attitude towards the conflict. Lord Lyons, the British representative, was unable to provide guidance on the Southern movement. Consuls in the South, like Bunch, offered insights. Bunch was critical of the South, particularly Davis, whom he deemed the only capable leader but with aggressive expansionist tendencies. Despite Bunch's negative views, he acknowledged the South's independence. Meanwhile, Seward, the future Secretary of State, expressed confidence in restoring unity in America. However, he also hinted at the possibility of a foreign war to unite America against European interference. British statesmen, led by Russell, emphasized a neutral stance and cautioned against provoking American hostility. The appointment of Charles Francis Adams as Minister to London was seen as a positive step towards maintaining amicable relations.|"1.

Lyons advised Russell not to reject the Southern Commissioners upon their arrival in London but to treat them well, hoping this would change Seward's perspective.

In June of 1859, a brief Conservative Government led by Lord Derby was replaced by a coalition Liberal Government with Palmerston at the helm, alongside Foreign Secretary Lord John Russell. Political pundits foresaw potential clashes due to differing ideologies.

"The British Government's attitude toward democracy during the American Civil War in 1861 was not clearly defined. The government, led by various liberal elements, operated with each representative managing their department independently. Palmerston's opinions held weight, but he rarely expressed them. Lord Russell, particularly in foreign affairs, held significant influence. The government was often referred to as the ""Palmerston-Russell Ministry."" Gladstone and Lewis were prominent figures, with Gladstone's abilities acknowledged, although his political stance was unclear.

On May 3, Russell received a memorandum from the Attorney-General regarding the recognition of the South's belligerency and their right to issue letters of marque and reprisal. The memorandum acknowledged the risks to British commerce but saw no immediate solution.

Russell quickly matured British policy, deciding to recognize the South's belligerent rights. This decision was communicated to Lyons on May 4, followed by formal instructions on May 6.

On May 2, Ewart in the Commons raised concerns about Privateers under unrecognized flags being treated as Pirates, reflecting Parliament's worry over Davis and Lincoln's proclamations. Russell assured that British interests were protected by a fleet sent out. Gregory, a Southern sympathizer, questioned whether the US knew effective blockades were required for recognition and if the South could issue letters of marque.

The British Parliament's discussion regarding the American conflict focused solely on legal matters and their potential implications. On May 15, Russell shared the official Proclamation with Lyons, leaving it to Lyons' discretion to communicate it to Seward. This discretion was common in diplomatic practices since the Proclamation was directed at British subjects, not the belligerents. The lack of official communication of the Proclamation led to disagreements, with the United States objecting to its issuance and timing by the British Government. Adams, the new American Minister, arrived in Liverpool on May 13 and sought an audience with Queen Victoria after an interrupted meeting with Russell. The press, especially the _Times_, emphasized the need for strict neutrality in the conflict, as both American sides sought British support. The _Times_ viewed the war as driven by selfish motives rather than principles or patriotism, likening it to historical conflicts resolved by force. Adams expressed concerns about the uncertain British stance on the conflict, fearing it could worsen the North-South divide.|"Question 1:

"The American Minister at that time did not privately hold a view of ""unfriendly animus."" On July 2, 1861, his son, who was a secretary, expressed confidence that the English were supportive of the American cause. However, doubts arose later. The British believed that issuing a Proclamation would help maintain neutrality amid the looming dissolution of the Union. When this did not go as expected, they tried to correct their mistake. Historical analysis now clears the British Government of any unfriendly intentions. The Proclamation was seen as premature by some, including John Bright. The British Ministry initially maintained a hands-off approach but had to act swiftly once actual conflict erupted in America.

The sympathies of an Englishman naturally lean towards the North, but forming any kind of alliance with the current officials could lead to an unsustainable position. They would likely make endless demands and show no regard for our neutral rights once they felt secure.

In 1861, during the Civil War in the United States, there was a delay in the official French Proclamation supporting the British Proclamation. Lyons, the British representative, trusted Mercier, his French colleague, who had been instructed to back the British Proclamation. However, no official French Proclamation was issued until June 10, causing Lyons to feel the need for an explanation. Mercier informally shared his instructions with Seward but made no official communication at Seward's request. Lyons later adopted the same approach.

In the new Cabinet, Chase of Ohio and Seward of New York were key figures expected to lead. Seward, the Secretary of State, was seen as the logical leader due to his political experience and high regard among anti-slavery groups. Seward, a former candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, was believed to shape the administration's policies. However, challenges to Seward's leadership arose, particularly regarding the handling of Fort Sumter. Seward's conciliatory approach aimed to delay conflict and believed in a strong Union sentiment in the South. Despite assurances to Confederate representatives, Seward's policy faced scrutiny as the decision on reinforcing Fort Sumter loomed. The situation highlighted the tension between Seward's strategy and the need for decisive action within the Cabinet.|"1. What role did Seward play in the new Cabinet?

The issue was at a standstill for a while. The Confederate Commissioners viewed Seward's delay strategy as advantageous for the South's plans and did not push for a decision.

"Seward's theory about the unifying impact of a foreign conflict was known in Washington. He shared this idea with Schleiden on January 26, expressing a wish for a war with England, France, or Spain to restore internal peace. Despite this, Lincoln's administration took a different approach, emphasizing friendly relations with foreign powers. However, by April 27, upon hearing that Russell was non-committal on British policy, Seward turned to threats. This shift in tone was evident to Lyons, who described Seward as ""arrogant and reckless toward Foreign Powers."" Seward's belligerent stance became more pronounced when he learned of Britain's neutrality declaration. On May 17, in a letter home, Seward expressed confidence in his foreign policy but lamented the lack of trust in his efforts. This led to the drafting of ""Despatch No. 10,"" which Lincoln softened to avoid provoking war. Adams, the recipient, was advised to use the spirit rather than the content of the despatch with discretion."|"1. What did Seward express a wish for on January 26?

Lyons was almost a month behind in knowing America's foreign policy towards England. He mistakenly believed an American attack on England was imminent, but this wasn't the case. Despite this, it was understandable given Seward's influence and Lincoln's lack of it. Lyons reported suspiciously due to Seward's actions, but later Seward clarified there was no intention of causing trouble with England. Seward credited himself for avoiding conflict by not acknowledging England's support for the South. Lyons, however, attributed the change to England's stern stance rather than the President's intervention. The correspondence between Adams and Seward played a crucial role in easing tensions between the nations. Seward's initial foreign war policy was later denied, and the Northern disaster at Bull Run did not influence the friendly expressions towards foreign powers. Lincoln's refusal to follow Seward's lead and the lessening of his aggressive tone preceded any news from England, lightening the initial tensions. Seward's policy did not lead to war as Lincoln intervened promptly.|"1. What was Lyons' mistaken belief regarding America's foreign policy towards England?

During a historical negotiation between Great Britain and the United States, which has been largely overlooked in history, there was a significant impact on the relationship between the two nations. Although this negotiation did not lead to a treaty, it played a crucial role in shaping the attitudes of both countries and their representatives.

After receiving instructions, Adams met with Russell on May 18 to discuss the American stance on the British Proclamation of Neutrality. Adams mentioned the need to adhere to the Declaration of Paris through a convention. Russell indicated that negotiations could proceed through Lord Lyons.

In 1891, an analysis was published that depicted a strained relationship between Russell and Lyons, with Russell being accused of deceit and evasion. The analysis highlighted a selfish British policy and France blindly following Russell's lead. The American proposal aimed to improve international war practices. When Frederic Bancroft, a biographer of Seward, examined the negotiation, he questioned if there was more to it than met the eye. Seward's goal was to have European nations treat Southern privateers as pirates, but this was not clear to all involved. Despite obstacles, Seward persisted, aiming to force other nations to view the Confederates as pirates. The negotiation was complex, with ulterior motives suspected on both sides. Seward's persistence, even after European recognition of Southern belligerency, showed his determination but lacked foresight into potential complications.|"1.

This passage discusses the views of different historians on the negotiation during the Civil War era. Charles Francis Adams, in his work about his father, disagreed with his brother Henry Adams' perspective.

During the Civil War, diplomatic negotiations between nations like Britain and the Confederacy played a crucial role. For example, in July 1861, British Minister Lyons started discussions with the South through Consul Bunch in Charleston. This move was later supported by British Secretary Russell.

During the Civil War, diplomatic negotiations between nations like Britain and the Confederacy played a crucial role. For example, in July 1861, British Minister Lyons started discussions with the South through Consul Bunch in Charleston. This move was later supported by British Secretary Russell. On August 14, 1861, the Confederate Commissions protested against a British order that seemed biased towards the Union, affecting the Declaration of Paris talks. Despite some interesting facts about Southern privateering during this time, like no privateer leaving a foreign port or entering a British one, the public remained mostly unaware of these diplomatic intricacies. Meanwhile, in America, after the attack on Fort Sumter, President Lincoln rapidly mobilized troops and increased the army and navy to prepare for the impending conflict, resulting in over 300,000 available troops by July 1.|"6. What did President Lincoln do after the attack on Fort Sumter?

"In the South, Davis was busy calling for volunteers to protect the Confederacy. Seven states seceded, joined by four more. Lincoln's ""border state policy"" held Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri to the Union. The Northern Congress approved Lincoln's measures, authorizing an army and loans. The British press believed the South had the decision to secede. The North prepared to preserve the Union. The _Economist_ questioned the South's actions, urging the North to avoid a futile war. By June, British press and public opinion shifted towards the South. Motley's letter defended the North's position against secession. He argued against peaceful secession and denied a Northern anti-slavery purpose. This led to a reevaluation of the American conflict by the British press, questioning the moral principles at stake."|"1. What was Davis busy doing in the South during this time?

During the early stages of the American Civil War, the British press closely followed the preparations of both Northern and Southern forces leading up to the first battle of Bull Run on July 21. The Northern army, initially successful, faced a humiliating defeat in this battle, which revealed their lack of military strength. British newspapers, such as the _Daily News_, initially praised Lincoln's leadership and the North's cause, but the outcome of Bull Run shifted opinions towards skepticism about Northern fighting capabilities. War correspondent W.H. Russell's reports in the _Times_ further emphasized the South's energy and determination, casting doubt on the North's abilities. The British public, influenced by these reports, began to question the North's chances of success in the war. Despite these sentiments, the British government maintained a policy of strict neutrality, avoiding official statements that could upset either side.|"1.

The Civil War in America had nothing to do with black slavery, as the conflict stemmed from the North's idolization of their Republic. The false principles of the American Republic were being exposed, revealing it as a mere bubble or a worthless tyranny of the sovereign mob. This early hint of democracy's future was a topic of cautious discussion in newspapers. While some believed the North would succeed in reducing the South, others were more skeptical. Various publications debated the American crisis, with differing views on secession and the role of slavery. The _Spectator_ and the _Daily News_ took contrasting stances on the conflict, with the former defending the North and the latter criticizing the South. The British press was divided on the issue, with some advocating for the dissolution of the Union for the benefit of Europe, while others warned against the potential consequences of such a breakup.|"1.

In the fall of 1861, British policy towards America was one of strict neutrality, approved by all papers and speakers. As the war in America progressed without major battles, attention shifted to the economic impact on England and the North's effective blockade. The _Saturday Review_ supported neutrality but emphasized distinguishing between observing the blockade and recognizing the Confederacy's government once the Southern states secured their independence. The British press, known for its vigorous writing, generally agreed on neutrality but varied in tone from dignified criticism to extreme vituperation.

Bunch had given Mure a paper that was seen as a passport by Mure and the United States.

"The undersigned declines any responsibility for the statement that Great Britain has taken the first step towards recognizing the Southern States, as Her Majesty's Government has only acknowledged them as belligerents, not as a separate independent state. Russell was cautious, advising Lyons to express diplomatically that any misunderstandings with the Washington Government would be resolved, and Lyons hoped to avoid abstract assertions, instead focusing on British recognition of Southern belligerent rights. Bunch's denial to Lyons focused on three points: disbelief in Mure carrying official despatches, assurance that all documents were for Her Majesty's service, and clarification of the ""passport"" as a certificate for Mure. Russell and Lyons were dissatisfied with Bunch's handling of private correspondence and his lack of denial regarding gossip of recognition steps. Seward instructed Adams to revoke Bunch's exequatur, citing Bunch's perceived partisanship towards the South. Lyon's view was that the charges against Bunch lacked substantial evidence, and he diplomatically left the meeting with Seward after reading the revocation instruction."|"1.

Lyons foresaw the American decision against Bunch on personal grounds, which he shared with Russell. While Lyons suggested the British response to the allegations, he accepted the American decision. Russell, anticipating Seward's actions, maintained neutrality, even considering the return of Southern Confederates to the Union. Despite Lyons' concerns about future U.S. relations, Russell remained composed. The Bunch controversy highlighted Britain's attempt to engage with the Southern Government, leading to a dispute over British claims to communicate with the Confederacy in defense of British interests. Amidst the _Trent_ affair, tensions rose, but the matter was eventually closed. The debate over cotton scarcity led to discussions between Lyons and Mercier, with Lyons cautioning against intervention due to potential repercussions. The British Cabinet also addressed the cotton issue, influenced by French arguments advocating a robust American policy.|"1. What did Lyons foresee regarding the American decision against Bunch?

In London, Lyons received Mercier's ideas at a crucial time. Just after Adams' complaint and Russell's response, while waiting to see Seward's reaction, Russell wrote to Palmerston about Mercier's insights. Russell believed that any action taken must be significant. He mentioned that England and France breaking a blockade for cotton wouldn't be wise. He stressed that proposing fair terms for peace might be more effective. Meanwhile, in Washington, Seward crafted a diplomatic message to Paris, emphasizing defiance against foreign intervention. Seward skillfully handled the cotton issue while maintaining a firm stance. Lyons and Mercier had differing views on national policy toward America, with Mercier pushing for recognition of the South. However, Lyons remained cautious, indicating that recognition might not be the right move. Their discussions intensified as Mercier tried to persuade Lyons, who remained steadfast in his position.

A letter from Lyons to Russell dated October 28, 1861, discusses the withdrawal of Bunch's Exequatur. There are two intriguing omissions in the letter.

A letter from Lyons to Russell dated October 28, 1861, discusses the withdrawal of Bunch's Exequatur. There are two intriguing omissions in the letter. The first omission suggests that Mr. Bunch was targeted to please the American public, while the second indicates the impact of Mr. Seward's despatch on Lyons. In another source, Bonham's research reveals that Bunch was more supportive of the South than Lyons believed. Lyons had proposed letting Bunch stay in Charleston discreetly. It is argued that the United States viewed Bunch as a scapegoat, evidenced by his role as an arbitrator in a U.S.-Colombia case in 1875 while serving as the British Minister in Bogota.|"6. How was Bunch viewed by the United States in the U.S.-Colombia case in 1875?
A) As a mediator

D) As a villain
E) As an ally"|B) As a scapegoat|Yes

Today, Chancellor Dr. Lushington, and other officials met to discuss the American cruiser's arrival to search the West Indian packet carrying Southern envoys. According to international law, the cruiser could stop and search the neutral packet for enemy despatches.

In history, it's known that Adams quickly learned of the softened language in the first draft of instructions to Lyons. Prince Albert advised toning down the message, hoping to convey that Captain Wilkes' actions were unauthorized. Lyons, before receiving instructions, expressed fear of the outcome and chose to remain silent. Cowley in Paris shared similar concerns, worried about the North and South uniting against Britain. Despite the bitterness in America, the idea seemed unlikely. Confederate agents in London tried to use the Trent affair, but Britain remained neutral. The delay in communication allowed for a calmer assessment by British leaders. Many, like Gladstone and Argyll, hoped to avoid war with America, seeing it as a calamity. Russell, cautious of Seward's policy, considered postponing hostilities if America refused recompense. The press initially demanded immediate action, but Russell sought Parliament's approval before going to war. The public mood shifted from outrage to a more reasoned approach, urging caution and delay in dealing with the crisis.|"1.

"During the tense period following the boarding of the British ship Trent, emotions ran high on both sides of the Atlantic. In London, an American resident expressed fears of immediate war due to the intense anger among the people. Meanwhile, in Edinburgh, another American noted the widespread indignation towards the incident. The British press responded with a sharp tone, reflecting the heightened tensions. The American public, equally incensed, celebrated the detention of British envoys and the exercise of the ""right of search,"" seen as a retaliatory measure. The North, already disheartened by the lack of progress in restoring the Union, found a momentary sense of triumph in this bold action. The incident also stirred memories of past grievances, particularly the British practice of the ""right of search,"" leading to a jubilant belief that the United States had finally given Britain a taste of its own medicine.

The incident also stirred memories of past grievances, particularly the British practice of the ""right of search,"" leading to a jubilant belief that the United States had finally given Britain a taste of its own medicine. Governor Andrews of Massachusetts even hailed Captain Wilkes' actions as a heroic service. The legality and wisdom of the boarding were debated extensively, with Congress eventually thanking Wilkes for his actions. Despite the widespread approval, Secretary of State Seward and other Cabinet members refrained from endorsing the incident, with hopes pinned on diplomatic solutions to avoid escalating tensions further."|"6.

Lincoln's silence on the _Trent_ matter puzzled many. The _Times_ expressed unease at the rapid military buildup in the US. As tensions simmered, Adams assured Russell that Wilkes had acted independently. American sentiments towards the _Trent_ incident shifted, influenced by British support for their demands.

"Adams' estimation was accurate. Even the _Morning Post_, widely recognized as Palmerston's mouthpiece, and during the _Trent_ crisis the most 'forceful' of all city newspapers, acknowledged the general public's desire for a peaceful resolution. However, on December 30, it questioned, ""... can a Government [the American] recently elected by popular vote, relying solely on popular backing, risk disappointing public expectations?"" The answer, unfortunately, seemed to be negative. The _Post_ (thus Palmerston?) did indeed, as later accused, ""prolong the tension,"" but not with its previous hostility towards America. The fact that the _Post_ was seen as Palmerston's mouthpiece justified this stance, as it would have been unwise for the Government to prematurely announce an outcome that was still uncertain. Yet, within the Cabinet, there was a more optimistic outlook. Argyll believed Adams' statement to Russell on December 19 was almost conclusive, and Adams himself now believed that the prevailing notion of an American plan to continuously ""humiliate"" Britain was fading: ""at least in this instance, no such intentions had been harbored."" Everyone was puzzled and frustrated by the delay in receiving a response from America, but optimistically believed it signaled an eventual compromise. There could be no certainty until the actual outcome. Russell wrote to Palmerston on January 7, ""I still think Lincoln will yield, but not until the last minute. If it comes to war"|"1.

Seward's response was quickly published in American newspapers. Lyons noted that it was well-received, and the public seemed calm and satisfied with the outcome. He believed that the war preparations had actually prevented a war. Seward's argument covered many aspects of the incident, discussing international law and the past relations between the nations. He concluded that the envoys should be handed over promptly. This decision faced challenges as Seward had to convince the President and Cabinet, support Wilkes, and manage the public's expectations.

The demand for the release of Mason and Slidell was not what stirred America the most, but the warlike tone of the British press and their government's preparations. Even after their surrender, America was further angered by British bragging that America had given in to a threat of war. This led to a cartoon in _Punch_ showing Uncle Sam apologizing to escape punishment from Britannia. America yielded to a threat but resented being told so, viewing it as a sign of British ill-will. In England, there was relief at America's decision but a determination to ignore the released envoys. The _Times_ criticized Mason and Slidell, claiming they were responsible for American prejudice against England, which was not entirely accurate.

The demand for the release of Mason and Slidell was not what stirred America the most, but the warlike tone of the British press and their government's preparations. Even after their surrender, America was further angered by British bragging that America had given in to a threat of war. This led to a cartoon in _Punch_ showing Uncle Sam apologizing to escape punishment from Britannia. America yielded to a threat but resented being told so, viewing it as a sign of British ill-will. In England, there was relief at America's decision but a determination to ignore the released envoys. The _Times_ criticized Mason and Slidell, claiming they were responsible for American prejudice against England, which was not entirely accurate. The British public, except for extreme pro-Southern factions, showed a shift in support towards the North, recognizing the dangers of aligning with a pro-slavery South.|"6. What was the British public's attitude towards aligning with a pro-slavery South?
A) Supportive
B) Indifferent

During the Civil War in America, the British government faced a dilemma regarding their stance on the conflict. Influential figures like John Stuart Mill believed that Britain had to show support for the North to prevent the spread of slavery. Despite some debate in Parliament, the government maintained a policy of strict neutrality. Bright, in a speech, emphasized the abolition of slavery as a crucial aspect of the war, aiming to ease American resentment. However, Palmerston defended military preparations as necessary precautions. The incident involving the _Trent_ further highlighted the complexities of Britain's relationship with America during the war. Ultimately, the British public expressed relief when the _Trent_ issue was resolved, emphasizing the importance of avoiding entanglement in the conflict due to differing views on slavery.|"1.

During the Trent Affair in 1861, there was a lot of debate about whether Lincoln or Seward had the wiser approach. While some believed Lincoln's view was more prudent from the start, it is shown that Seward did have the opportunity to read the instructions on the nineteenth. There was suspicion surrounding Seward's anti-British policy, even within Washington, as seen in a dispatch from Schleiden to the Senate of Bremen. Lincoln's reported language, suggesting pressure on Seward to release the prisoners, was actually part of a strategy to propose arbitration to Great Britain.

In the six months after the _Trent_ incident, the relationship between Great Britain and America seemed calmer. However, tension began to rise due to the Northern blockade of Southern ports, affecting British trade. This blockade was initially declared by President Lincoln in April 1861. Even before this, concerns arose about British ships trading with the secession port of Charleston, South Carolina. Efforts were made to prevent any interference with British trade, with hints of possible British intervention to protect it. Despite initial opposition to any blockade, by April 1861, there was a shift in views, considering an attempted blockade better than legislation closing Southern ports. These discussions aimed to caution the American government and prevent actions that could lead to British and French recognition of the Southern Confederacy.|"1.

Lyons believed he could intimidate the North out of a blockade campaign, but when the Civil War began, and Lincoln declared a blockade on April 19, Lyons felt it must be recognized if conducted lawfully. The blockade began at certain Virginia ports on April 30, and by the end of May, warships were stationed at important Southern harbors. The method of warning vessels at the port created uncertainty for British merchants. Lyons was skeptical about blockading a 3,000-mile coastline, but Seward assured him it would be effective. The British press also doubted the blockade's success, believing the war would be short. While there was early acceptance of the American effort, when a plan to close Southern ports legislatively was revived in June, Britain opposed it vigorously. Russell defended Lincoln's method and believed the blockade, if legal and effective, deserved British recognition. The introduction of a Bill in Congress to proclaim closed ports stirred opposition from Britain, especially Russell, who protested vigorously to America. France initially supported the protest but later withdrew, fearing American retaliation. Despite the Bill passing both Houses of Congress, England declared it would not observe a legislative closing of Southern ports. Lyons expressed concern over the potential consequences, as even Sumner supported the Bill, indicating a serious intention to enforce it. Russell sent formal protest instructions, but authorized Lyons to use discretion in communicating the message.|"1. What was Lyons' initial belief regarding the North's blockade campaign?

Lyons believed he could intimidate the North out of a blockade campaign, but when the Civil War began, and Lincoln declared a blockade on April 19, Lyons felt it must be recognized if conducted lawfully. The blockade began at certain Virginia ports on April 30, and by the end of May, warships were stationed at important Southern harbors. The method of warning vessels at the port created uncertainty for British merchants. Lyons was skeptical about blockading a 3,000-mile coastline, but Seward assured him it would be effective. The British press also doubted the blockade's success, believing the war would be short. While there was early acceptance of the American effort, when a plan to close Southern ports legislatively was revived in June, Britain opposed it vigorously. Russell defended Lincoln's method and believed the blockade, if legal and effective, deserved British recognition. The introduction of a Bill in Congress to proclaim closed ports stirred opposition from Britain, especially Russell, who protested vigorously to America. France initially supported the protest but later withdrew, fearing American retaliation. Despite the Bill passing both Houses of Congress, England declared it would not observe a legislative closing of Southern ports. Lyons expressed concern over the potential consequences, as even Sumner supported the Bill, indicating a serious intention to enforce it. Russell sent formal protest instructions, but authorized Lyons to use discretion in communicating the message.|"4. How did Seward reassure Lyons about the effectiveness of the blockade?
A) By providing evidence from previous wars
B) By promising British military support
C) By assuring him it would be a short-term measure
D) By emphasizing the legality and effectiveness of the blockade
E) By downplaying the importance of the blockade"|D) By emphasizing the legality and effectiveness of the blockade|Yes

"In June and revised in July, the original instructions hinted at ""reprisals,"" drawing possible French opposition.

Within three months, the British government faced their first serious debate on the effectiveness of the American Civil War blockade. Pressure from France prompted a reevaluation of their neutrality policy due to the blockade's impact. Simultaneously, the Mexican Republic posed a challenge to European nations, leading to joint efforts by France, Great Britain, and Spain to address Mexican debts. President Buchanan warned Europe against territorial ambitions in Mexico. France, however, had ulterior motives, aiming to establish a colonial empire. British Ambassador Cowley and Foreign Secretary Russell grew wary of France's intentions, leading to British forces withdrawing from Mexico. This suspicion of France's hidden agenda in Mexico influenced British policy towards the Civil War, aligning them more closely with the North.

"Spence's summons to London indicated the government's concern about a potential pro-Southern move in Parliament. Spence met with key figures like Palmerston and Russell, but missed Gladstone. The prevailing sentiment in London was one of ""postponement"" due to the belief that the North would soon face financial collapse. Spence acted as an intermediary, advising against delay.

The government presented a comprehensive report on the blockade to Parliament, sparking debates challenging its effectiveness. Gregory and others argued for declaring the blockade ineffective, while opponents like Forster highlighted the blockade's impact on trade and the need for British neutrality.

"Spence's summons to London indicated the government's concern about a potential pro-Southern move in Parliament. Spence met with key figures like Palmerston and Russell, but missed Gladstone.

Gregory's speech was cautious and aimed to maintain a judicial tone, focusing on facts. In contrast, Forster's speech exuded confidence, as if he believed his cause was already won. Henry Adams described Gregory's speech as lacking passion, comparing it to a funeral eulogy. The Solicitor-General supported the effectiveness of the blockade, countering Gregory's argument by warning of the consequences of not recognizing it. The debate highlighted the North's supporters' approval of the Government's policies towards America. The Solicitor-General's speech indicated that the motion would not succeed unless it became a partisan issue, which did not seem likely. Lord Russell upheld the legality of the blockade and predicted the end of the conflict within three months with a form of union.

In the same letter, Lyons discussed the Northern excitement over recent military triumphs.

During the Civil War, news traveled slowly to England, much like McClellan's cautious advance in the peninsula. Two foreign diplomats, Mercier in Washington and Lindsay in Paris, independently sought to mediate the conflict.

I discussed Mr. Mercier's plans with him and offered advice on his approach. I mentioned the misconception in the South about forming an exclusive alliance with a European power. Some believed they could entice France with commercial privileges. Mr. Davis and his associates may not hold such beliefs, but it's essential to eliminate this notion. Mr. Lyons met Mr. Mercier a few times and maintained a facade of harmony with France. Mercier returned from his trip to Richmond, recognizing the South's determination for independence. He mentioned that the Confederates no longer expected European aid and were resolved to stand alone. Mercier shared his views on recognizing the South's independence, believing it might not hasten peace at present. He suggested waiting and observing events before taking any action.|"1.

Mercier's recent journey led him to believe that the Confederates were gearing up for a final push, bringing out their last resources and armies. If defeated, they would likely accept the terms offered. Talk of retreating inland was deemed futile. The United States taking control of the Border States and Coast would end the need for further conflict. Those opting to retreat inland were free to do so. Mercier's trip had him reiterate earlier views, advocating for early Southern recognition. However, Russell and Lyons had differing opinions, with Russell questioning the sustainability of U.S. control if small Confederate groups resisted. Seward aimed to clarify Mercier's trip through a newspaper statement, dispelling misconceptions. Napoleon's alleged involvement left many puzzled in London and Paris. Confederate agents initially believed Napoleon backed Mercier, later fearing Seward's influence. Despite mixed signals, Southern hopes were also pinned on another diplomatic incident preceding Mercier's visit to Richmond, stirring both Confederate agents and the British Ministry.|"1.

In short, Lyons opposed getting involved unless there was a clear move towards peace in the North, and even then, he saw this as only a possibility. Russell, too, stuck to the established policy. He mentioned the news from York Town, New Orleans, and Corinth, hinting at potential Southern defeat. He pondered over whether the South truly desired separation or if the Union could be restored with lingering issues. Separation seemed like the only fair solution to him, but he knew the North wouldn't agree. Meanwhile, Thouvenel from France maintained strict neutrality, waiting for events to unfold. Efforts towards mediation were personal, as France and Britain hadn't taken up the idea yet, especially with Northern victories ongoing. In London, Mason summed up the situation, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the future. Southern leaders were advised to remain calm and avoid public displays against the government's inaction. Seward's attempt to retract Southern belligerent rights was met with resistance, showing a mismatch in European and American perspectives. Lyons, not taking Seward's demands too seriously, sought leave to return home, indicating a lack of immediate concern.|"1. What was Lyons' stance on getting involved in the conflict?

A month had passed in London without any significant news from America. While there was a belief that Richmond might fall to McClellan's army, the South's determination to resist gave hope to their British supporters. Lindsay considered making an effort in Parliament for peaceful mediation between the North and South. This idea arose due to rumors of Washington's mediation and the failure of previous motions on recognition and the blockade. However, not all supporters of the South agreed with this approach. A clash between Palmerston and Adams over General Butler's order in New Orleans caused tension. Despite misunderstandings, Adams remained composed and diplomatic in his responses, ensuring the situation did not escalate further.|"1. What was Lindsay considering doing in Parliament?

Adams cautiously waited for a response from Britain before making any moves. Palmerston's actions might have been a tactic to relieve pressure for policy change.

During June 1862, the Civil War in America appeared to reach a stalemate in the eyes of the English. McClellan's failed advance on Richmond by Lee marked a significant setback for the North. The Peninsular campaign was deemed a disaster, overshadowing earlier Northern victories. The progress of the campaigns in the West for the North was overlooked. The time was ripe for a strong Southern effort as Parliament's adjournment neared. By July, hopes were pinned on the cotton districts to potentially aid the Southern cause due to the increasing depression since the war's onset. The belief in the power of cotton, as the backbone of Southern wealth and influence, was deeply ingrained in Southern minds and had a significant impact on international relations, particularly with England.|"1.

During June 1862, the Civil War in America appeared to reach a stalemate in the eyes of the English. McClellan's failed advance on Richmond by Lee marked a significant setback for the North. The Peninsular campaign was deemed a disaster, overshadowing earlier Northern victories. The progress of the campaigns in the West for the North was overlooked. The time was ripe for a strong Southern effort as Parliament's adjournment neared. By July, hopes were pinned on the cotton districts to potentially aid the Southern cause due to the increasing depression since the war's onset. The belief in the power of cotton, as the backbone of Southern wealth and influence, was deeply ingrained in Southern minds and had a significant impact on international relations, particularly with England.|"4.

"During the American Civil War, the South believed in the power of cotton to influence British foreign policy. However, the failure of the first Commission to Europe and British neutrality despite the lack of cotton gradually opened the eyes of the Southern states. The ""King Cotton"" theory, which suggested that England would depend on the South for cotton, was proven false as the Lancashire Cotton Famine caused serious hardships in England. About 500,000 workers in Lancashire's 2,195 cotton factories depended on the Confederate South for cotton supply. The war initially caused an accumulation of raw cotton in England, but the shortage eventually led to a rise in cotton prices, affecting the English cotton trade. Despite initial relief from trade depression, the blockade proclamation by President Lincoln further impacted the cotton trade in England."|"1.

During the American Civil War, the impact on the English cotton trade was initially felt in Liverpool's speculative and importing markets for raw cotton. Prices surged to over a shilling a pound in October 1861. Rumors of British intervention led to a near panic on November 23, but prices rebounded in five days. However, news of the _Trent_ incident on November 27 caused market confusion, not due to hopes of increased cotton supply but fears of war with America. The blockade from the South halted cotton supply, with only 11,500 bales received in six months. The situation led to pressure on the government for action to secure cotton. Despite the unexpected wealth in the cotton trade, manufacturers prospered from rising prices. The cotton industry was saved from disaster, and profits increased due to the inflated price of stocks on hand.|"1. What impact did the _Trent_ incident have on the English cotton trade?

During the mid-1800s, Lancashire faced a severe crisis due to a shortage in cotton supply. This led to many factory workers losing their jobs and relying on public aid or private charity for basic needs. The number of people needing assistance increased rapidly, reaching over 550,000 individuals at one point. Despite the distress, there was no starvation as the community came together to support those in need. While discussions arose about government intervention to secure more cotton, the majority sympathized with the North during the war and did not pressure the Cabinet for action. The crisis also sparked conversations about finding alternative sources of cotton and adapting to the changing circumstances. Overall, the Lancashire community showed resilience and unity during this challenging time.|"1. What was the main cause of the crisis faced by Lancashire during the mid-1800s?

Persigny subtly informed Slidell about private instructions from Napoleon to Thouvenel, who was visiting London. Napoleon wanted England to recognize the South, but Palmerston had already opposed this in Parliament. Despite rumors, Thouvenel believed interfering in America was risky and would not be well-received by British officials. Southern hopes rose due to knowledge of Napoleon's desires. Amid distress in Lancashire, Lyons in London feared mainly for cotton, not an immediate clash with America. The debate on July 18 aimed to sway the Ministry in favor of the South. Lindsay argued for mediation, citing Lancashire's plight. Pro-Southern speakers highlighted Lancashire's distress, urging recognition for the Southern states. However, Forster warned that mediation might prolong the war and worsen English commercial troubles.

Persigny subtly informed Slidell about private instructions from Napoleon to Thouvenel, who was visiting London. Napoleon wanted England to recognize the South, but Palmerston had already opposed this in Parliament. Despite rumors, Thouvenel believed interfering in America was risky and would not be well-received by British officials. Southern hopes rose due to knowledge of Napoleon's desires. Amid distress in Lancashire, Lyons in London feared mainly for cotton, not an immediate clash with America. The debate on July 18 aimed to sway the Ministry in favor of the South. Lindsay argued for mediation, citing Lancashire's plight. Pro-Southern speakers highlighted Lancashire's distress, urging recognition for the Southern states. However, Forster warned that mediation might prolong the war and worsen English commercial troubles. Ultimately, Palmerston opposed the motion to avoid taking sides prematurely and risking future interventions.|"3. What was Lyons in London mainly concerned about?
A) A clash with America
B) Napoleon's desires
C) Mediation between North and South

"Lindsay's efforts on July 18 seemed unsuccessful on the surface. Lyons described it as ""ill-timed,"" unsure of the disaster's extent to McClellan. The parliamentary debate hinted at support for mediation, causing Lyons to fear Mercier's push for it. Henry Adams shared the sentiment, believing interference was inevitable if they remained in Virginia by July. Slidell's actions hinted at France's potential separate action, offering deals without authority. Slidell's persistence in seeking French action conflicted with advice to follow Britain. Mason considered demanding recognition from France and Britain after the North's failures. The British government's uncertainty was evident in delayed responses and hints of a shift in neutrality, with Gladstone privately anticipating change."|"1.

The ongoing conflict needs to stop. The South has shown unity and determination, but reopening ports like New Orleans hasn't brought any relief. The distress in manufacturing areas could pressure the government. In Parliament, there were sneers at cotton manufacturers in Lancashire.

In August, Parliament adjourned after passing an Act to help the distressed in Lancashire by giving more power to the Poor Law Guardians. Pro-Northern groups in London believed the Southern push for a change in British policy had failed. Despite Russell hinting at future action, many saw it as a gesture to the South. Both Southern and Northern circles outside the Cabinet were unaware that the Ministry was leaning towards mediation. The North faced setbacks as McClellan was removed, and the Northern army retreated from Virginia. Stuart reported that hopes of obtaining cotton seemed bleak and the peace party was losing ground. The British Ministry's hopes for Northern weariness of the war were fading. Argyll wrote to Gladstone about the North's determination, indicating that mediation was not yet possible. The British Ministry was surprised by the renewed Northern energy, which led to a shift towards mediation.|"1. What was the purpose of the Act passed by Parliament in August?

Mercier's idea of taking action in October aligns with your own thoughts. I will return to England before October, and then we can discuss it further. However, the war may lose momentum before that time. An intriguing book titled _Cotton is King, and Pro-Slavery Arguments_ was released in Augusta, Georgia, in 1860. It compiled works by Southern scholars defending slavery from various perspectives like political economy, ethics, and law. This publication aimed to justify slavery, highlight cotton's significance, and argue that the U.S.'s power rested on controlling the cotton supply. The editor, E.N. Elliot, was the President of Planters' College in Mississippi. Additionally, a letter from Bunch to Russell in December 1860 revealed the importance of cotton in diplomatic negotiations. The South's heavy reliance on cotton was evident when Col. Gorgas urgently sought three ironworkers from England due to a lack of industrial diversity beyond staple products.|"1.

"During the Civil War in America, there was a misconception in England that the cotton disaster was solely due to the war. However, it was later understood that the famine was also caused by oversupply. In a debate in June 1862, speakers like Egerton, Potter, Villiers, and Bright discussed the distress in the manufacturing districts without criticizing America. Orders for cotton were described as including ""foreign-owned"" cotton, purchased by British citizens for export. Despite the challenges, the English resolved to uphold their laws and not recognize any side until the war ended. This stance was maintained even when faced with the temptation to engage in conflict with America, a decision deemed more serious than the Mexican adventure."|"1.

The stock market, a reflection of government actions, experienced sudden changes after Gladstone's speech, hinting at potential war involvement. Cotton prices fell sharply, causing concern among Southern supporters. Bright, a Northern ally, hoped Gladstone's words were to spur action rather than mere persuasion. Newspapers initially approved but soon grew wary of unclear policies. Within the Cabinet, Gladstone's unconventional speech stirred debate. Despite Russell's displeasure, he proposed an armistice, highlighting the South's resilience and the North's flawed emancipation plan.

A neutral observer might agree with Lord Russell's historical perspective and wish for a peaceful end to the war between the conflicting sides. However, decisions on proposals from the English Government are influenced by passionate partisans rather than unbiased bystanders. The focus should not be on how philosophers or calm individuals would perceive the proposals but on how they would be received by the intended audience. Lincoln's emancipation proclamation, although possibly aiming to incite conflict, actually highlighted the deep bitterness that hindered rational discussions. Any action by Britain other than strict neutrality was deemed risky. Statesmanship required caution and a consideration of potential consequences. Despite differing views within the British Cabinet, the prevailing sentiment was to maintain a stance of neutrality and observe the war's course before taking further action.|"1.

G. Lewis proposed a plan for England, France, and other major European powers to request America to pause the war. However, this proposal was not initially considered by Russell, who believed that all five powers needed to be involved for it to work. Despite some shifting positions, Russell maintained that he had always contemplated a joint action by the five great powers of Europe.

"On October 27, Cowley discussed American affairs with the Emperor Napoleon, who proposed a joint mediation by England, France, and Russia. However, Cowley had no instructions. Napoleon then suggested a six-month armistice to calm the current tensions. The next day, Cowley reported that Drouyn de Lhuys mentioned the Emperor's desire to end the war but was unsure about the timing.

_The Index_ was steadfast in its belief that within the Cabinet, Russell was viewed as the primary adversary of the South. Slidell, who was better informed, expressed surprise at Russell's support for accepting the Emperor's proposal, apart from Gladstone. Napoleon was upset as he expected his proposal to be accepted, possibly leading France to act independently.

England's decision not to intervene in America pleased the public and the Government. Lyons, upon arriving in America, found opposition to mediation, especially from the Conservatives. The Northern press rejected foreign aid, showing no gratitude to England, blaming Napoleon III instead. Seward and Adams accepted Britain's unchanged policy after the answer to France in November. Seward's calm approach to foreign affairs led to a Cabinet controversy, but Lincoln's intervention prevented Seward's resignation.

In August 1862, Stoeckl advised against European mediation in the American Civil War, fearing it would worsen the situation. He believed waiting until the next spring was best. Lyons, the British ambassador, also cautioned against mediation without being prepared for war. Mercier, a French diplomat, was eager for action, hoping France's involvement would force the United States to yield. However, Stoeckl disagreed, stating that mediation would only work if backed by force to open Southern ports. In October, Russell proposed inviting France and Russia to join England in offering peace services to the U.S., with hopes of Russian support. Granville's opposition and the Queen's likely disapproval, along with the necessity to act before Parliament reconvened, influenced the decision-making process.

In September, McClellan's victory over Lee at Antietam marked a turning point. Lincoln issued a proclamation on September 22, 1862, promising steps to persuade loyal border states towards voluntary action. On January 1, 1863, a second proclamation declared all slaves in designated states free. The purpose of the emancipation proclamation was to weaken the South economically and bolster the North's military strength by enlisting freed slaves. Lincoln's motive was not to incite a servile insurrection but to shift the balance of power. The proclamation aimed to demonstrate a moral cause to foreign nations. Despite British interests, the North's anti-slavery stance was pivotal. Even before the war, Southern intentions to revive the African Slave Trade were known. The North's actions regarding slavery influenced British opinion and support for the Union cause.|"5. How did the North's actions regarding slavery influence British opinion according to the text?

During the American Civil War, England had mixed opinions on the North's approach to slavery. While some English publications like the _Times_ criticized the North for not taking a strong stance against slavery, others like the _Spectator_ believed that the North needed to make it clear that the restoration of the Union did not mean the continuation of slavery. Officially, England held the view that the separation of the North and South would eventually lead to the end of slavery in the South. Despite the North's efforts to suppress the African Slave Trade, England viewed these actions as weak attempts to gain sympathy rather than genuine anti-slavery efforts. The London Emancipation Society was founded to protest England's perceived support for the South, emphasizing the importance of the anti-slavery cause in the Civil War. Lincoln was advised by some to issue an emancipation proclamation to clarify the North's stance on slavery and prevent foreign intervention, but there is little evidence to suggest that he did so to correct the foreign view.|"1.

On July 13, Lincoln informed Seward and Welles about the planned emancipation proclamation, marking the first time he discussed it. Seward responded positively but wanted time to fully consider the proposal. The next day, he sent a copy of the Bill introduced in Congress to agents overseas, outlining Lincoln's gradual emancipation plan. This swift action was unusual. Seward forwarded the Bill without much commentary, indicating it aligned better with his views on slavery concerning foreign relations than an immediate proclamation of emancipation. Meanwhile, concerns grew in America about potential shifts in British neutral policy. Adams reported on July 11 that the British Cabinet might take a new stance soon, adding to Seward's hesitance to issue the proclamation. Despite Seward's arguments against immediate action, Lincoln decided to delay. Seward's approach aimed to prevent foreign intervention by threatening a servile war, emphasizing a materialistic perspective. His views resonated with initial responses from government circles abroad, particularly in England.

The construction of Confederate war vessels like the _Alabama_ in British ports and the subsequent controversies have been extensively studied from legal, diplomatic, and international law perspectives. The focus here is on examining the key incidents related to Southern ship-building in British yards at that time. The intentions of the British Government hold more significance in this analysis than the correctness of its actions. In 1860, the issue of a belligerent's right to obtain or build warships in neutral nations was not clearly defined in international law. The British Foreign Enlistment Act of 1861 prohibited British subjects from aiding belligerents in any ship-related activities. However, the Act had a loophole as it required proof of the offense after it had been committed, making it challenging to prevent violations. The South, lacking a navy, sought advice from British lawyers and carefully followed the Foreign Enlistment Act to construct war vessels in British yards without violating neutrality laws. Captain J.D. Bullock was a key figure in this process, ensuring strict adherence to the law. The steamer _Oreto_ cleared from Liverpool in 1862 with a declared destination but was later reported to be completing its equipment as a Southern war vessel. The _Alabama_, equipped with British guns and crew, operated as a commerce destroyer, capturing and destroying Northern merchant ships. The North viewed the _Alabama_'s actions with growing resentment, questioning British neutrality.|"1. What is the main focus of the text?

Adams felt let down by the debate's outcome, believing it undermined Lord Russell's speech rather than supported it. He and his English advisors were uncertain whether to trust Russell's hints of more active government efforts or accept that Palmerston had dismissed his advice. Despite their anxiety, they failed to realize that the delay in announcing a new policy didn't mean the old one would continue. The pressure on the government came from America's threat to deploy privateers if their demands weren't met. Russell's reaction to the debate was indifferent, as he ordered the detention of suspicious ironclads. The seizure of the _Alexandra_ marked a shift in policy, with public support for preventing further ship-building for the South. Russell's change in stance was driven by concerns over American privateering and the need to counter the South's blockade-breaking ships.|"1. What was Adams' reaction to the debate's outcome?

During the Civil War, Russell, a British diplomat, feared the American plan could harm British trade and lead to war. Seward, the American Secretary of State, hinted at using privateers against British ships. Russell, alarmed, asked for explanations and prepared naval instructions to protect British commerce. Lyons, the British Minister, worried about escalating tensions and the possibility of war with the U.S. He believed Seward's actions were driven by political motives. Despite initial concerns, Seward's conciliatory response to British protests calmed tensions. The crisis peaked in March-April 1863 over Southern ship-building in Britain. Seward's efforts to improve relations with Britain in August contrasted with the usual historical focus on the threat of war. The Laird Rams incident, involving British-built ships for the Confederacy, highlights the importance of British reactions to American plans during the Civil War.|"1.

In England, public opinion turned against Southern ship-building. Ship-owners in Liverpool urged changes to prevent Southern ships being issued from neutral ports. The ship-owners feared British commerce would suffer if England became a belligerent. The ship-owners found it disgraceful that British law was being publicly violated. The under-secretary, Hammond, claimed the law was sufficient if proof of intent to violate it was found. Ship-owners, distinct from ship-builders, were alarmed. Attention shifted to the trial of the _Alexandra_, where a decision against the Government was appealed, causing anxiety among Northern and Southern agents. Rumors about the Rams' ownership were spread, but evidence for seizure was hard to obtain. Diplomatic tensions rose, with threats of war hinted at by both sides. Adams presented evidence to urge the immediate seizure of the Rams, fearing British involvement in the war if they escaped. The government hesitated to act due to the lack of concrete evidence.|"1.

Russell was criticized for delaying the seizure of the Rams, which were intended for use as warships against the United States. Adams, the American Minister, was initially dissatisfied with the delay and criticized the law officers of the Crown. However, once informed by Russell about the situation, Adams was pleased with the firm action taken. British officials and diplomats were also pleased with the seizure of the Rams, which occurred in mid-October after being under surveillance since September 9. Despite some opposition in Britain, the Government's decision was generally supported. Legal opinions were against the seizure, prompting Adams to press for changes in British law or a mutual agreement on neutral duties with America. The Government defended its actions, emphasizing that they aimed for honest neutrality. Opposition parties in Britain criticized Russell for allegedly yielding to American threats, but the Government defended its decisions.|"1.

In the mid-1800s, the issue of neutral countries building and arming ships for warring nations was unclear. An example of this confusion occurred during the Texan war of independence against Mexico in 1843. Mexico contracted two warships from an English firm, with British naval officers on leave to command them and British-made guns. The British Foreign Secretary, Aberdeen, initially allowed the ships to be fully equipped. However, when Texas objected, Aberdeen changed his stance, allowing only one ship to sail as planned while the other had to be stripped of its equipment. British confusion on neutrality in such cases was evident, with some officials supporting Mexico while others were unsure of the correct course of action. This historical event sheds light on the complexities of international relations and neutrality.|"1.

In the mid-1800s, the issue of neutral countries building and arming ships for warring nations was unclear. An example of this confusion occurred during the Texan war of independence against Mexico in 1843. Mexico contracted two warships from an English firm, with British naval officers on leave to command them and British-made guns. The British Foreign Secretary, Aberdeen, initially allowed the ships to be fully equipped. However, when Texas objected, Aberdeen changed his stance, allowing only one ship to sail as planned while the other had to be stripped of its equipment. British confusion on neutrality in such cases was evident, with some officials supporting Mexico while others were unsure of the correct course of action. This historical event sheds light on the complexities of international relations and neutrality.|"6. What does this historical event during the Texan war of independence shed light on?

During September 1863, there was a significant crisis involving the Rams, ironclad ships built by the Confederates. Adams, feeling anxious, believed the crisis peaked in September, but historical evidence suggests the real decision-making moment for the government occurred in April. The British government finally seized the Iron Clads, causing tension with the Americans. Despite doubts about the legality of the seizure, the British were confident in their actions. The Foreign Office believed they had prevented a violent attempt to get the ships to sea. The South had already expelled British consuls by October 1863, leading to further diplomatic tensions.|"1.

"The plan to seek support from the Tories did not gain much traction initially and showed no immediate progress during the parliamentary debate on February 5, 1863. Derby supported the Government's decision to reject Napoleon's proposals. Russell, having recovered from Cabinet setbacks, expressed weariness with ongoing mediation talks and emphasized the need for both sides to tire of the conflict before considering peace efforts. The House of Commons was against taking any immediate action, fearing it would be futile for the South and might strain relations with the North. Southern efforts to influence the British government were temporarily stalled, leading to a shift towards financial strategies. The Confederate Cotton Loan aimed to raise funds for Southern agents in Europe and garner support for the South. Financial challenges plagued the Confederacy, hindering its operations both domestically and abroad. Efforts to establish credit in England faced obstacles due to the depreciation of Confederate currency. Initially, drafts were issued through Fraser, Trenholm & Company, but as Confederate money lost value, alternative methods were explored, including using cotton as collateral. Despite various attempts to secure funds, the Confederacy struggled with financial instability, prompting the consideration of a formal ""cotton loan"" in Europe."|"1.

The loan that had sparked excitement was now struggling, causing concern among promoters and diplomats. Adams was suspected of supporting the bonds, and tensions rose as Spence and Erlanger & Company clashed over market stabilization methods. Eventually, Mason reluctantly allowed funds to be used to buoy the bonds, fearing the loan's collapse. Despite efforts to prop up the loan, it failed to generate significant revenue for the Confederacy. The loan, intended to garner public support, instead became a reflection of Southern fortunes, lacking the stability of a sound investment. The loan's fluctuating value eroded confidence and failed to sway opinions in favor of the Confederacy.|"1. What was the main issue the King faced regarding the loan?
A) Lack of excitement

In an attempt to prevent any errors from the telegraph, I am clarifying that M. Mocquard's note is confidential and should not be utilized. Although shared with Messrs. Roebuck and Lindsay, it should remain confidential. Roebuck sought information from Baron Gros and learned that no formal communication had been made to Russell regarding Napoleon's desires. Lord Campbell questioned Russell in the House of Lords, revealing discrepancies between accounts. Roebuck's motion urged the Queen to negotiate with foreign powers for Confederate recognition, citing benefits to England. However, the debate revealed contradictions and lack of evidence to support claims. The debate highlighted the complexities of diplomacy and the risks of involvement in the war, leading to calls for continued British neutrality. Ultimately, the debate underscored the importance of accurate information and cautious decision-making in foreign affairs.|"1. What is the main purpose of M. Mocquard's note?

I received your note on the 29th of last month. In today's newspapers, the debate in the House from last night, which I attended, is detailed. Lord Russell's response to Lord Campbell in the House of Lords regarding the French situation remains unclear. Without the Emperor clarifying his intentions in writing, we can't fully understand his true motives or benefit from his private revelations. The public opinion is that the Emperor speaks differently in private versus to his ambassador in England. The debate will resume tomorrow, with Lindsay providing further explanation. The _Times_ and the _Economist_ both opposed premature recognition of the Confederacy, emphasizing the need for force to back any actions. Roebuck's motion faced criticism and doubts about its success, with concerns about its impact on relations between Britain, France, and the North. Palmerston, back in the House on July 6, aimed to avoid further debate on Napoleon's involvement, urging Roebuck to drop the matter to maintain good relations between France and England.|"1.

The following day in the Commons, Sir James Ferguson asked Roebuck to drop his motion due to the uncertain situation in America. Palmerston agreed, suggesting that personal matters should not be discussed in the House. Despite Palmerston's efforts, Lindsay continued the debate, advising Roebuck to postpone the motion. The debate continued with criticisms of Roebuck's and Lindsay's actions. Northern supporters were pleased, while Southern backers felt uneasy. The debate was seen as damaging to the South's cause. Roebuck eventually withdrew the motion, not because of Southern victories, but to avoid defeat in a vote. The debate marked the end of discussions on mediation or recognition. News of Lee's setbacks at Gettysburg and Vicksburg's fall reached London, shifting perceptions on the war's outcome. The surrender of Vicksburg was seen as a significant blow to the South, altering views on the war's progress.|"1. What was Sir James Ferguson's request to Roebuck in the Commons?

During July 1863, the fall of Vicksburg deeply affected Spence, causing him distress. Adams reported that the news led to panic among Cotton Loan bond holders. The upper classes were relieved they had not supported Roebuck's motion. The crisis of Southern efforts in England was seen as doomed from the start, worsened by Lee's setbacks in Pennsylvania. The real turning point had already passed, evident in Benjamin's recall of Mason from London. Mason, realizing British intervention was unlikely, withdrew on September 21. While Mason hoped for support from France, England remained neutral. The North was pleased by British inaction, with Lyons reporting a possible joint action by England, France, and Spain against the North. This idea was met with opposition, especially from Lyons, due to the ongoing denial by Seward that the war aimed to crush rebels, causing diplomatic tensions.|"1.

The British government faced a dilemma regarding their stance on the American Civil War. While some believed that a firm approach would be more effective than appeasement towards the Americans, others were wary of the potential consequences of such a declaration.

The _Index_ newspaper, controlled by Henry Hotze, used secret funds to influence writers in London during the Civil War. Hotze was connected to Southern agents in Europe but not fully trusted by Mason or Slidell. Materials from Hotze, including letters and cash books, were once in possession of Charles Francis Adams but have since been lost. Hotze provided news and editorials to London papers and distributed items like cigars and whiskey. Despite complaints about not having a paid writer at the _Times_, Hotze paid Percy Gregg, who later wrote about the Confederacy. Slidell believed strong influences would support their cause. Schwab's account of Erlanger's presence in Richmond is incorrect. Mason's role in Confederate finance is detailed in Walter M. Case's thesis.

Schwab suggests that Erlanger & Company may have been suspiciously involved in holding the bonds in question and then selling them to Confederate agents when the market was collapsing.

Northern friends in England were quick to organize public gatherings after the second emancipation proclamation in 1863. In contrast, Southern supporters, confident in the Confederacy's success, initially relied on newspapers for their views. By mid-1863, Spence recognized the need to counter Northern influence, forming a Southern Club in Manchester and others in neighboring towns.

Despite financial challenges, Spence's efforts gained momentum, leading to public meetings and petitions for Southern independence. The initiative received praise for its vigor, with plans to expand to major cities like Liverpool and London. The goal was to convert passive support into active advocacy to influence government policy.

"After December 1862, there was no further mention of the Association. It is possible that its trivialities led to its demise, and in any case, it was not meant to attract public attention. The launch of the Southern Independence Association indicated a new strategy in London to coordinate and direct efforts already underway in the provinces. A detailed constitution and address highlighted the heroic struggles of the Confederates and England's ""general sympathy"" for their cause. It criticized the North for governmental tyranny, corruption, ruthlessness in war, and animosity towards Great Britain. The Association aimed to foster goodwill between Great Britain and the Confederate States, advocating for the gradual abolition of slavery while preserving property and civilization for the African American population. The Association, with its esteemed Committee and officers, had a substantial membership fee, but its effectiveness remained uncertain. The movement's strength was primarily in Manchester, where a peculiar situation emerged when pro-Northern speakers questioned the lack of Southern public meetings. The Association's appeal to the elite hindered its reach to the broader working-class and Radical England, already supportive of the Northern cause. Goldwin Smith's pamphlet criticized the Association for being aristocratic and aiming to incite war with the North, alienating potential supporters. The Association's lack of public meetings and the London branch's inactivity hinted at its faltering impact. Plans to challenge the Government's detention of Southern vessels were in motion, with hopes of rallying public opinion against unfair practices."|"**1.

Mr. Adams' claims are bold, his arguments flawed, and his threats comical, yet he has managed to have an impact. We see his influence in the detention of the _Alexandra_ and the legal battles that followed, in the surprise attack on the rams at Birkenhead, and in the government's plan to amend the Foreign Enlistment Act to align with the United States' demands. Despite his questionable methods, Mr. Adams has achieved some success, especially in avoiding conflict between the two nations. The relationship between British Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Earl Russell, and the United States Secretary of State, Seward, has improved, with both sides showing less hostility.

From February to June 1864, there was a significant focus on a particular issue.

Palmerston's willingness to listen to suggestions for a change in British policy towards America, his satisfaction that Lindsay planned to delay the parliamentary motion, and his friendly attitude towards someone he had recently criticized for interfering in diplomacy, all point to a desire to prevent Southern allies from joining the growing criticism of the Government's Danish policy. Lindsay may not have fully understood this, appearing to have been misled in his correspondence with Mason. It is likely that the government was keen on not alienating supporters, hence the subtle use of the Danish situation without overt threats. The public press, previously pessimistic about the South, was now more optimistic, with the _Times_ leading the way. The Society for Promoting the Cessation of Hostilities in America proposed a deputation to Palmerston, representing a significant portion of the population, to push for action aligned with Lindsay's initial proposal.

Lyons, a British official, reported to Russell in April 1864 about Captain Goodenough's confirmation of his American reports.

"After three years of intense efforts by the North to defeat the South and the South's defensive campaigns turning into offensive battles, the Civil War seemed to have reached a stalemate. To neutral observers in Europe, the war appeared to be at a standstill, much like how the Great War seemed to American neutrals in December 1916 after two years of conflict. The war had defied expectations of a swift resolution, and with each passing month, the scale of the conflict grew, and society seemed to normalize war. By mid-1864, many foreign observers, including those from Britain, believed that both sides were deeply entrenched in a conflict that showed no sign of a clear military victory. Despite this, there was a prevailing belief that the South would ultimately prevail due to its commitment to resistance until independence was secured. However, the North's association with emancipation and the South's defense of slavery had become a significant obstacle for Southern advocates. The issue of slavery had become a focal point, with even Southern supporters acknowledging the need for its gradual extinction. This shift in perception posed challenges for the South, as Northern allies capitalized on this vulnerability, labeling slavery as ""The Foul Blot."" The Index, in response, argued against this characterization, emphasizing that the South treated enslaved individuals as fellow human beings with respect and mutual obligations, refuting the notion of slavery as perceived in England."|"1.

When Lincoln was elected, significant changes were predicted: the South would likely give up the fight; the once unproductive lands worked by enslaved labor would thrive again with free labor; and the Confederates would need to rely on their own skills rather than the labor of others. Surprisingly, these ideas were penned by M. Henri Martin, a renowned French historian. A week later, _The Index_ criticized the support pouring from Germany to aid the North, suggesting that white-skinned Germans were being sold to fight in the South. Even the Confederate Secretary of State, Benjamin, accused France of deceit, claiming the French Emperor was taking advantage of the South's struggle to further his own agenda. This period also saw a change in British opinion of Lincoln, from initially portraying him as silly-faced to recognizing his abilities and power.|"1.
