The delay gave us time to prepare for defence. Mercy strategically positioned six hundred cavalry to cut off the French cavalry on the right. Our barricade was well-made with narrow openings between square piles. The Germans fired on us, but we waited until they were close before retaliating. Major O'Mahony and Colonel Wauchop led our regiments in a successful counterattack. The French regiment occupied the church and the battery, while Vaudemont's corps approached. The Irish garrison surprised the Austrians with heavy musketry fire. Eugene, upon hearing of the defeat, tried to negotiate with the Irish but was met with defiance. The battle continued with Marshal Villeroy wounded, D'Entregues defeated, and the Spanish Governor injured. Eugene's attempts to persuade the Irish to surrender were unsuccessful.|"1.

We discovered Mademoiselle Pointdexter and were informed that her carriage, along with the horses, remained in the stable. We retrieved it, harnessed the horses, and placed her attendant, an elderly woman, in the carriage. Mike drove, I rode a horse, and we escorted her to her father's residence in Versailles. After ensuring her safe arrival, we hurried back just in time for the regiment's formation on parade. I had not encountered Baron Pointdexter and was uncertain of his actions—whether he would conceal the incident or report it to the king. Until I learned his decision, I believed it prudent to remain silent. Upon my visit to Versailles today, I discovered that he had brought the matter to the king's attention. The Vicomte de Tulle, responsible for the offense, had been banished to his estates.

While I acknowledge the baron might swiftly return to his lands, the vicomte could be ready to depart upon receiving the news. However, he must ride about eighty miles to intercept our path. He might head north to find a suitable spot for an ambush. Even if he hastens, we will be halfway to Paris before any potential encounter. My men should rendezvous with us by then.

They left a lookout at Pont Gibaut, and Desmond scouted the area but found no sign of the enemy. Later, a scout reported that the enemy had taken a route to Croc with a carriage and a horse litter.

In general, people tend to support the winning side. In Madrid, they would cheer for the Archduke Charles as much as for Philip, except in Catalonia and Valencia. These regions fear Peterborough and support the Austrian cause because they see him as almost supernatural. Some cities show equal loyalty to both candidates without clear reasons. The French fight for Philip due to his relation to Louis, but they have little faith in their Spanish allies. The Spanish military strength has declined due to past defeats and resource depletion. The ongoing war involves England against France, as the Dutch and Austrians are preoccupied elsewhere.

During the ongoing conflict, Marlborough and Eugene led the main body to the river for crossing, while Vendome planned to attack them. Burgundy, however, wanted to continue the march to Ghent.

Marlborough then ordered an attack on the French at Eynes, leading to the capture and dispersal of several battalions. A fierce battle ensued with both sides fighting fiercely in difficult terrain.

Mike, you've helped me greatly. When you told me your sister was coming to clear up the mystery of my birth, I never imagined she'd provide proof of my heritage. I aim to prove I'm James O'Carroll's son, even if regaining the estates may be challenging due to my past in the Brigade. Lord Godolphin's support might help. But my true goal is to establish my Irish lineage. I plan to return to France, seeking officers who knew my father for evidence. Your sister's testimony is crucial, backed by Mrs. Callaghan's account. The officers' recognition of my likeness to my father would strengthen my case. The chain of evidence, from my baptism certificate to your sister's care for me, seems solid. Even if I lose the estate, proving my name's legacy matters most.|"1.
