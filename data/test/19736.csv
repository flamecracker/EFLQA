"Russ eagerly took the skate wagon to the top of the sidewalk ""hill,"" as the Bunkers called it. With one foot on the board with roller-skate wheels, he demonstrated how to push off and coast down.

Despite her pleas for the dog to move, she collided with it. The dog, startled and hurt, quickly ran back into its yard. Thankfully, Rose only ended up with a few scratches on her knees.

The little dog was safe behind his fence, looking out and barking. He had been knocked about but not hurt much, just a bit bruised and mussed up.

Mun Bun and Margy joined after playing in the sand pile, too small to coast alone. The roller-skate wagon was faster than Mun Bun's junk cart. It was early August with plenty of summer left. The weather was hot, but there was shade at Aunt Jo's house. They found a pocketbook, thinking it belonged to a poor woman. The six little Bunkers had fun playing, going on excursions, and riding the skatemobile. Tom's top accidentally broke a window, but the hired man fixed it.|"1.
