Roger observed his cousin Ethel Blue with admiration, noting her practical side amidst her dreamy nature. They planned a Rose Fête at Rose House, where they would convert Chinese lanterns into roses for a charming evening ambiance. The United Service Club, known for its good deeds, organized the event to turn Mr. Emerson's farmhouse into a summer retreat for mothers and babies.
