Rollo paused during his walk to enjoy some raspberries. He believed they would complement his bread nicely, adding variety to his lunch. After eating his fill, he decided to gather some for Jonas, who was occupied with work. The raspberries were abundant and plump, making it easy for Rollo to fill his dipper quickly. As he sat on a log, he pondered whether planting raspberry seeds directly would have been a simpler option than transplanting bushes. Realizing that spring was the planting season and raspberries wouldn't last till then, he planned to consult Jonas. Carrying his dipper carefully, he continued his walk until he reached a brook with a makeshift bridge. Watching insects skimming the water's surface, Rollo marveled at their ability to stand on water. He was intrigued by air bubbles emerging from the brook's bottom and pondered the source of the water's never-ending flow.

While the druggist was measuring his remedies, Rollo was intrigued by the small balance scales he used. Rollo had never seen such tiny scales before. The weights were also small, square brass weights with intricate designs on them. Curious, Rollo asked the druggist about the cost of such scales. The druggist explained that they ranged from one to five dollars, which Rollo felt was too expensive. However, James suggested a frugal alternative using a knitting needle and thread to create makeshift scales. The druggist then demonstrated how to calibrate a one-grain weight using a square of lead. He encouraged Rollo to replicate the process at home to create additional weights. After receiving his medicines and paying the bill, Rollo carefully stored the change and items in his pockets, ready to head home with newfound knowledge and a practical lesson in weights and balances.|"1.

Jonas described a fearsome character named Old Zero who wreaks havoc during winter storms. He roars through the forests, burying everything in snow, breaking trees, and unroofing houses.
