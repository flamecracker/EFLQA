Ten years ago, during the failed secession attempts of 1850 and 1851, Andrew Pickens Butler, a prominent South Carolinian, opposed the movement despite his desire for secession. He argued against it to prevent dividing the Southern States. Robert Barnwell Rhett led the secession advocates, but Butler believed that forcing a state into secession against its will would only create reluctant allies. Despite Butler's efforts, secession gained momentum. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina successfully seceded. Meanwhile, in Georgia, the secession debate raged. Governor Brown hesitated due to President Buchanan's alleged promise not to alter military positions in Charleston. However, when news broke that Anderson had moved troops to Sumter, Governor Brown seized Fort Pulaski, marking the beginning of Georgia's secession. This event signaled a shift in sentiment among previously hesitant citizens towards secession.|"1. What was Andrew Pickens Butler's stance on secession during the failed attempts of 1850 and 1851?

B) He opposed secession.
C) He was indifferent towards secession.

A belief that Washington had begun to act aggressively spread through the lower South. State conventions were held in quick succession: Mississippi on January 9, Florida on January 10, Alabama on January 11, Georgia on January 19, Louisiana on January 26, and Texas on February 1, passing ordinances of secession. Georgia saw a strong opposition from Unionists, including Stephens and Toombs. The debate was not about the right to secede, which virtually no one disputed, but about the wisdom of doing so. Despite efforts to delay secession, the majority voted in favor. Stephens emphasized his allegiance to Georgia over the United States. The radicals in Alabama and Texas were eager to secede without delay, despite some attempts at conservative resistance. The Confederate States of America were swiftly organized, adopting a Constitution similar to the United States with some changes. Davis became President, and Stephens Vice-President. Army recruitment began, and diplomatic efforts were made to negotiate treaties and sway Virginia to join the Confederacy.|"1. What was the main concern of Unionists like Stephens and Toombs during the state conventions?

C) The wisdom of seceding

The upper South faced a dilemma, torn between sympathizing with seceding States and desiring to preserve the Union while maintaining local autonomy.

Sumter marked a crucial moment in history. The sound of the first cannon aimed at the fortress is iconic. The debate over who gave the order to fire rages on. The South Carolina authorities sought advice from the Confederate leaders when they learned of Lincoln's plan to resupply the fort. Despite warnings, the decision was made to demand Sumter's surrender. General Beauregard, in charge of the Charleston militia, was instructed to make the demand. As tensions mounted, a telegram hinted at a Federal force coming to reinforce Sumter. Beauregard, convinced of Federal deception, demanded surrender on April 11th. Anderson, in Sumter, refused immediately but hinted at a looming surrender due to dwindling supplies. As the night passed without action, anxious crowds dispersed. Reports of a Federal ship near the harbor prompted a late-night visit to Sumter, resulting in an ultimatum for surrender or face bombardment.|"1.

The council of the aides at Sumter is a captivating detail that has intrigued historians, leading them to indulge in a literary interpretation. The scene of four young men holding the fate of a people in their hands, at a crucial moment, is so intense that it tempts artistic embellishment.

The account of a fiery Virginian, Roger A. Pryor, adds drama to the story. The dawn of April 12, 1861, marked the beginning of the conflict at Sumter. Charleston, with its preserved charm, witnessed the bombardment with crowds gathering at East Battery to watch the spectacle unfold. The city's skyline and the fortifications at Sumter created a picturesque backdrop for the unfolding events.|"1. What has intrigued historians about the council of the aides at Sumter?

This marked a shift towards centralizing military control and was seen as essential for success, despite some opposition.

"A true portrait of President Davis during the height of his power showcased his determination and strategic abilities. He organized and equipped armies, fortified Richmond, and supported his appointed commander, Lee, during the Army of the Potomac's retreat after the victory at Second Manassas. This victorious period marked a bright spot in Confederate history. The Administration's robust military strategy led to powerful Confederate armies, inspired by Lee's successes. The peak of hope was the planned triple offensive in August 1862: Lee invading Maryland, Bragg invading Kentucky, and Van Dorn challenging Federal forces in the Southwest. The goal was to influence Northern elections, reclaim territories, and shift the tide against the Lincoln Government. Despite financial challenges, the illusion that ""Cotton is King"" persisted until harsh realities set in with events like the surrender of Fort Donelson."|"1.

"During the first year of Confederate foreign affairs, the South had to buy various goods from Europe, such as arms, cloth, and machinery. Christopher G. Memminger, the Confederate Secretary of the Treasury, faced the challenge of establishing the new government's foreign credit. A significant aspect of this period was a commercial campaign between Federal and Confederate agents to control the European munitions market. Despite facing challenges due to credit issues, the Confederate agents managed to secure contracts for items like rifles. To fund these purchases, the Confederacy relied on seizing specie from the Southern branch of the U.S. Mint and Southern banks, as well as a loan and a direct tax. However, the Confederacy also resorted to issuing paper money, leading to its depreciation and causing financial hardships for government workers and soldiers.

In 1861, despite the concerns of plantation owners, the belief in King Cotton's dominance remained strong. The Confederate leaders seemed unfazed by the blockade that year, viewing it as beneficial. They saw it as a way to boost manufacturing through protective tariffs and to pressure England by cutting off cotton exports. Laws were passed to restrict cotton exports, and planters were advised to hold onto their cotton. In 1862, there was hope in the Confederacy, with Mason receiving support in England. However, the tide turned against the Confederacy due to the Emancipation Proclamation and military setbacks. The cotton shortage in England caused distress, leading to failed financial schemes.

"During the Civil War, there was a lack of transparency in the Confederate Administration's efforts to secure arms from Europe. The Charleston Mercury criticized the government for delays, but the truth was that they were quicker than the Union in sending agents abroad. Despite this, the country remained unaware of these facts. The government paper, the Courier, did not address the accusations directly, instead offering general praise for President Jefferson Davis. The Mercury and Courier engaged in a heated debate, mirroring similar conflicts in Richmond between the Enquirer and the Examiner. The Examiner was known for its fierce attacks, with writer Edward A. Pollard standing out for his extreme views. Pollard's book, ""The First Year of the War,"" blamed Davis for various failures, portraying him as arrogant and incompetent. The book aimed to undermine the Confederate Administration, accusing Davis of poor decisions and neglecting the welfare of soldiers."|"3.

During the Civil War, there was internal criticism within the Confederate Government. Pollard accused the government of not enforcing the conscription law properly. The Examiner and the Mercury supported President Davis on conscription but criticized his handling of it.

Brown, even compared the conscription acts to an attack on constitutional liberty. By the autumn of 1862, discontent was rising, partly due to the government's secrecy. President Davis, while possessing good qualities, lacked flexibility and humor, which affected his leadership during the war. His health issues and dogmatic nature also contributed to his challenges as a leader.|"1.

It was a significant part of Davis's journey to stand alongside a brilliant leader like Lee without recognizing his genius. Davis, however, never truly grasped Lee's exceptional character, despite their amicable relationship during the Seven Days' Battles. Davis's unwavering faith in his own abilities led him to believe that together with Lee, they could achieve victory. Despite Davis's limited military experience, he compared himself to Lee, who had a far more distinguished military career. Davis's leadership style lacked the charisma and influence that Lee possessed. His choices in personnel, like his confidence in Bragg, were questioned by later military analysts. The Cabinet members under Davis also faced criticism for not meeting the demands of the time. One unique figure was Judah P. Benjamin, a Jew from the West Indies, who had a remarkable legal and political career. Benjamin's intellect and adaptability made him a standout, yet his tenure was marred by controversies. Davis's unwavering loyalty to Benjamin, despite opposition, reflected his commitment to those he trusted. Davis's presidency faced challenges due to his focus on government efficiency rather than building popular support. This approach may have contributed to his administration's unpopularity and the eventual crisis they faced.|"1. What was one of the reasons Davis never truly grasped Lee's exceptional character?

During the Civil War, the Confederate Government had six Secretaries of War. Leroy P. Walker, Judah P. Benjamin, George W. Randolph, Gustavus W. Smith, James A. Seddon, and General John C. Breckinridge served at different times. In 1863, the government introduced three main programs. Two of these, the Impressment Act and the Tax in Kind Act, were well-received initially. The Impressment Act led to a rapid drop in prices, benefiting the economy. The Tax Act aimed to generate revenue without using depreciated currency. However, a bill proposing to suspend habeas corpus rights created a rift between the government and opposition. The Mercury supported the Tax Act but strongly opposed the suspension of rights, leading to a significant divide between the two factions.|"5.

"During the Confederate Congress, a heated debate arose over reviving the expired second Habeas Corpus Act.

The idea of the government owning slaves was met with resistance from Southern planters who feared the potential power and disruption it could bring, including industrial competition and military control. Concerns about favoritism and labor system upheaval led to a reluctance to acquire slaves. The control of slaves during the war also posed issues as the fighting population decreased, leaving a need for oversight. Laws exempting overseers from military duty and hiring substitutes for drafted men caused social unrest, with accusations of favoritism toward the wealthy. Women of all classes played crucial roles in supporting the war effort, enduring hardships and sacrifices. The war brought about a shift in societal dynamics and perceptions, highlighting the challenges faced by both the wealthy and poorer classes.|"6.

The hardships faced by people during the Confederacy have become well-known. These difficulties mainly stemmed from three factors: the blockade, poor transportation systems, and the greed of speculators. The blockade severely impacted the South by disrupting the cotton-based economy, hindering the import of essential goods like medicine, and depriving the population of basic necessities. The shortage of medicines persisted throughout the war despite efforts to produce them locally. The limited industrial capacity in the South, with only a few facilities capable of producing military supplies, led to struggles in meeting demands. The inefficient railway system exacerbated the situation, causing congestion and hindering the transportation of vital supplies. Speculators took advantage of these challenges, driving up prices and profiting from the suffering of the people. Bishop Pierce highlighted the ruthless actions of speculators, who hoarded food while the population starved.|"1. What were the three main factors contributing to the hardships faced by people during the Confederacy?

During the Civil War, soldiers' families faced tragic circumstances. If a soldier didn't own land, his family struggled due to the high cost of living and low pay. Local charities were the only barrier between these families and starvation, providing relief through state, county, and neighborly assistance. Families often had to flee to remote areas to escape the war's destruction, enduring perilous journeys and seeking safety from lawless outlaws. Despite the challenges, heroic women led these families, displaying remarkable courage and resilience. The Southern spirit remained strong even after setbacks like the battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg. While the Secretary of War tried to downplay the losses, the reality was that the South faced increasing hardships and isolation, with the Trans-Mississippi practically cut off. This marked a turning point in the war, where the odds were stacked against the Confederacy.|"1. What was a significant challenge faced by soldiers' families during the Civil War?

During the four months between Vicksburg and Chattanooga, distressing events unfolded, leading to the semi-isolation of the middle region of the lower South. Mississippi and Alabama faced their most desperate chapter in history, caught between financial and military demands from Richmond and ruthless raids from the North. By 1864, Confederate lines were irregular, leaving Mississippi and parts of Alabama beyond aid. The civilian population, although hopeful, faced the harsh reality of the war's impact on their lives. Richmond's call for resources fueled resentment, highlighting the struggle between local and Confederate authorities over conscription. The administrative duel, exemplified by the clash over habeas corpus, further complicated matters. Alabama's troubles were exacerbated by raids, like Wheeler's daring ride, leaving towns stripped of provisions and livestock.

From the Confederate perspective, all seemed lost. The situation grew too intricate to follow closely. In summary, the papers were sold to the United States, the secret was exposed, and the United States launched a forceful attack on the Imperial Government. Slidell, overwhelmed by anxiety, sent a note to the Emperor that was blunt and ill-advised.

The situation in Georgia was dire, leading Davis to personally intervene. Leaving Richmond with a somber mindset, he aimed to convey the military perspective to the people. His intent was for them to grasp the soldier's viewpoint, focusing solely on defeating the enemy.

Lee lamented the lack of recruits due to conscription policies, while the Mercury accused Davis of neglecting South Carolina's defense against Sherman. The labor shortage worsened due to military orders, affecting projects like the Columbia and Augusta Railroad. Magrath proposed a regional alliance to counter Confederate disarray, prompting Governor Vance to call for political acumen over military strategy.

Despite the President's initial reluctance, he eventually yielded to Congress and signed a bill on January 26, 1865, creating the office of commanding general, appointing Lee to the position.

"In the Confederacy, a segment of the population lacked worldly experience, mainly comprising small farmers and semi-peasants exempt from taxes but denied education. These individuals, devoid of the mental grounding of the upper classes, were quick to fight but limited in their understanding of life, incapable of envisioning diverse circumstances. When faced with hardship, like sudden taxation or a turn in the war requiring imagination and faith, they panicked childishly. Believing in talk as a solution, they clung to the fantasy of endless discussions reconstructing the Union. In North Carolina, state sovereignty supporters saw secession as a defense of their principles. Despite having no interest in promoting slavery, they resisted any interference. The uneducated populace, reacting strongly to taxation, began questioning their alliances and pondered if leaving the Union could lead to better conditions. Their hope lay in returning to the old Union, a sentiment echoed in the catchphrase ""the Constitution as it is and the Union as it was."""|"1.

In Georgia, during the Civil War, Alexander H. Stephens emerged as a prominent figure. He strongly opposed the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus and the Conscription Act, criticizing President Davis for his policies. Stephens, known for his constitutional beliefs, questioned Davis's intentions and accused him of aiming for absolute power. Despite his extreme views, Stephens was never disloyal in his actions.

During the Northern elections, Davis hoped for support from anti-Lincoln men. Stephens publicly suggested that Davis wanted the Northern peace party to fail. Davis, surprised by this claim, wrote to Stephens demanding an explanation. Stephens, in a lengthy response in mid-December, defended himself on two grounds.

Stephens believed such a convention could have ended the war and secured Southern independence. Secondly, Stephens mentioned a case involving a Northern soldier who claimed to be a peace envoy to Davis but was not taken seriously. Stephens believed Davis thwarted peace negotiations. Stephens later proposed resolutions for peace in 1865, despite Lincoln's nationalistic re-election. The peace intrigue involved figures like Napoleon III and Francis P.

During the Civil War in 1865, General Lee faced a critical decision about using African American troops. He feared that if the enemy continued to advance, they would recruit the able-bodied men among the enslaved population, turning them into soldiers and ultimately emancipating all slaves.

While Lee proposed employing African American troops and gradual emancipation, the state of Virginia did not immediately act on his recommendations. The delay in making a decision only added to the challenges faced by the South. Despite the mounting pressure, Lee chose not to intervene in broader Confederate politics but focused on the local crisis in Virginia.

The debate between the Government and the opposition reached a climax involving various political motives. Some, like Smith and Lee, supported emancipation by the States' free will. Others preferred subjugation over arming slaves, leading to conflicting views. Some were open to arming slaves but not granting them freedom. R. M. T.
