War seemed distant, but the sight of Sumter's flag reminded them otherwise. Colonel Talbot shared his thoughts on an impending great war, overshadowing past conflicts. Later, they chased a spy, Shepard, through the streets. Despite the pursuit, Shepard managed to escape.

Trains were slow as Harry and Arthur journeyed through a low, rolling country, crossing rivers and seeing large houses and small negro cabins. The region was still recovering from winter, but greenery was beginning to emerge in the valleys. Spring was in the air, lifting the spirits of the young Palmetto Guards. Arriving in Montgomery on the Alabama River, they awaited the inauguration of President Jefferson Davis. Despite their eagerness, the strict discipline of Colonel Talbot and Major St. Hilaire kept them in line. The guards, mostly South Carolinians, set up camp near the town. That night, as the chill of early spring settled in, the troops gathered around fires, cooking bacon, ham, and coffee. Harry, tired but content, sat by the fire with his comrades, including the cheerful Tom Langdon, anticipating the events that lay ahead.|"1.

We were a small group facing the iron rain that day, yet many would have given much to be at Monterey with us. Harry, moved by memories, recalled his father's words about the gallant Mexican fighters. At Frankfort, they honored Kentucky's fallen heroes with O'Hara's poem. The sentimental era was filled with poetry, but as night fell, solemn thoughts emerged. Langdon, breaking the seriousness, shared a poem by Holmes lamenting South Carolina's secession. Despite the poem's accusations, Langdon defended their departure with pride, not passion. They enjoyed a hearty supper by the fire, basking in its warmth, while sentinels patrolled in the shadows. Harry realized the weight of military discipline, knowing leaving was no longer a choice. The reality of their impending duties began to sink in.|"1.

Their big day arrived. Bright sunlight bathed the town, the hills, and the brown Alabama waters. It was a uniquely Southern place, Harry noted, different from his Kentucky, more spirited, perhaps, and less concerned about consequences. People arrived not just by train, but also in wagons and on horseback from distant lands. Distinguished men wore long black coats, wide-brimmed black hats, and white shirts with shiny or heavily ruffled fronts. The excitement was palpable, even among the black residents, despite the looming war. Eager to explore Montgomery, Harry and his friends refrained from asking permission, as Colonel Talbot had adamantly denied all requests. Adorned in their pristine uniforms, they were ordered to line up after a hearty breakfast, ready to march into town. The sight of the well-dressed soldiers drew cheers from the growing crowd. Harry, with a small sword at his side, felt a surge of pride as they paraded through the enthusiastic onlookers. The South Carolinians, a standout group, exuded confidence. As they neared the capitol dome, the Guards, carrying the Palmetto flag, redirected their path toward the railway station. Standing at attention, the soldiers, though motionless, were filled with anticipation. Colonel Talbot and Major St. Hilaire stood prominently ahead, overseeing the troops.

Harry was awestruck by his first sight of Jefferson Davis, the President-elect. Contrary to his expectations, Davis appeared as a cold, gray, and silent man with tightly pressed lips. Instead of the fiery passion associated with the South, Harry observed a demeanor of reserve and icy resolve akin to the North. As Davis acknowledged the cheering crowd with nods but no smiles, Harry noted the sternness that never wavered. The procession led to a grand hotel where Yancey, a renowned orator, welcomed Davis on behalf of the Southern people. Harry, among the front row, absorbed every moment, his eyes fixed on Davis. Despite the applause and speeches, Davis remained stoic, his thoughts concealed behind his expression. Harry's attention briefly shifted to Shepard, a surprising presence in the crowd, prompting concerns based on Colonel Talbot's warnings.|"1.

The bands proved the following day to be all that Jarvis had assured, and they continued their journey with renewed energy, pleasant weather accompanying them. They delved deeper into the mountains, a region embodying the essence of a true wilderness. Occasionally, they spotted smoke rising from log cabin chimneys, and glimpsed cabins nestled in secluded spots, yet no one greeted them. The war news had reached these parts, making the mountaineers cautious and reserved. Harry found their reticence convenient for their travels. As they navigated a southerly branch of the Kentucky River, they encountered more wildlife, with Jarvis successfully hunting a deer and two wild turkeys. Their boat journey became slower due to the strong current, prompting Harry to occasionally walk along the bank, invigorated by the mountain air. The landscape transformed into towering mountains covered in dense greenery, creating a sense of remoteness from the distant war Harry was headed towards. Their progress slowed as they rowed up a narrow mountain creek, flanked by towering peaks and lush forests. Passing only two cabins in a two-day journey, Jarvis decided to leave the boat at a trusted acquaintance's cabin, Bill Rudd, before continuing the journey on foot to Jarvis's home. Rudd and his family were eager to hear news from the outside world, showing curiosity towards Harry, who was a new face in their midst.|"1. What did the bands prove to be the following day?

As the Invincibles charged, the defenders retreated from the fort, taking two cannons with them. Upon reaching the woods, they fired back at the Southern troops, causing them to hesitate. The Invincibles, fueled by victory, attempted a counterattack but were met with a deadly response, forcing them to seek cover behind the earthworks they had captured. Amidst the chaos, Langdon joked about a near miss, while St. Clair remained composed despite the danger. The officers quickly directed the men, including young recruits, to fortify their position along the earthworks. Despite casualties, the Invincibles managed to repel the Northern troops, who resorted to firing shells from a distance.

At noon, a plentiful meal was served in the fort. Barrels of water were discovered, and the men eagerly drank, feeling thirsty from their work. The three boys, despite their status, had been working alongside the men and now leaned tiredly against the earthwork. The noise of tools had stopped. In a solemn silence, the men ate and drank, while no sounds came from the Northern troops in the woods. A heavy silence lingered over the valley, charged with the memory of battles. Harry felt a sense of calm, his gaze shifting to the fresh earth covering the fallen soldiers, sending a shiver down his spine. The wounded soldiers, though in pain, remained patient, tended to by the surgeons and their comrades. Discussing the possibility of a siege, St. Clair noted the underestimated skills of the mill workers and mechanics. Harry agreed, realizing the magnitude of the looming war.|"1.

Three scouts, dispatched by Colonel Talbot, returned with information that confirmed his suspicions. A sizable force, likely from Patterson's army in the hills, was advancing down the valley to link up with those ousted from the fort. The convergence was imminent, within an hour. Harry, present during the report, grasped its gravity. He was relieved that the earth walls had been heightened and the trenches deepened. In the afternoon's midst, as shadows crept over the eastern woods, a rustle caught their attention. Bushes swayed, and officers glimpsed movement in the undergrowth. Suddenly, a thunderous crash echoed as shells from a battery soared and exploded nearby. Luckily, the Invincibles' deep trenches shielded them, even as two shells breached the fort. Colonel Talbot, with Harry as his aide, ordered the gunners to hold fire until the enemy charged, conserving ammunition. Amid the cannonade, the fort endured a crossfire, but the well-constructed trenches minimized casualties. Harry, by the Colonel's side, observed his intense scrutiny of the woods through binoculars, noting a rare smile. Colonel Talbot speculated that the skilled artillery officer behind the attack was likely Carrington, renowned for his precision and tactics.|"1. What did the three scouts confirm in their report?
