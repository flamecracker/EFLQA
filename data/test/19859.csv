Initially, I admired Miss Burton's lively appearance. She would call me her little sweetheart and tease me about being a flirt. The lawyer would humorously ask about my relationship with Miss Eliza.

"At six o'clock, I always wanted breakfast, Nurse. Do you hear me, Nursey?"" I requested while Mrs. Bundle pretended to be engrossed in watching a flock of sheep pass by. If I had breakfast at six, then I thought luncheon at half-past ten would be nice. I got distracted by a worsted workbag filled with delicious buns Nurse Bundle had. Stopping to water the horses, I was given a glass of milk from a nearby inn with a sign that read ""At about half-past eleven we arrived in Farnham."" I was thrilled to explore the garden at ""The Bush"" inn. I imagined the stone figures in the garden might be enchanted. After lunch, we continued our journey. Nurse Bundle shared stories of Dick Turpin, the highwayman, as we passed Bagshot Heath. We dined and changed horses at Virginia Water, where I learned about the lake and the ship from a man with a wooden leg. Despite being tired, I declined a seat inside the carriage. The journey made me sleepy, and I barely noticed the sights along the Thames Valley. We stopped at Hounslow, where I struggled to stay awake despite Nurse Bundle's attempts to point out the city's features. Finally, we arrived at a quiet square, and I was helped inside to rest.

I was half-awake when I thought I heard Rubens, my dog, lapping water from a jug, a sound I associated with home. But Rubens couldn't be here in London with me. As the sound persisted, I grew uneasy.

In the middle of the square where my uncle and aunt lived, there was a garden with trees, grass, and gravel paths. Polly and I played hide and seek, ran races, and chased each other and Rubens there. The garden was open to all in the square, and other kids often played there too. One day, as I wandered, a new boy caught my eye.

I later saw him in the garden, where his dignified and melancholic demeanor intrigued me. We developed a friendship, although he could be self-absorbed. Despite his flaws, I remained loyal. My cousin Polly, on the other hand, was different - quick-tempered and resolute, but not selfish. I always yielded to both Polly and Leo, accommodating their whims with my easy temper.|"1.

"""I've seen plenty of ponies!"" she said firmly, not because she had seen many, but because she had seen more than enough. She recounted a tale of her brother-in-law's cousin and his red-haired pony, a creature as fierce as a wild cat. The pony won many races but eventually caused the cousin's demise, leaving him lifeless and the pony grazing nearby as if nothing had happened. Despite the tragic incident, the cousin had valued the pony greatly, refusing a substantial sum for it shortly before the fatal accident. The narrator, now a proficient rider, was unfazed by the story but wished the cousin had met a less tragic end. Mrs. Bundle, the narrator's nurse, lacked knowledge about horses, failing to distinguish between their behaviors or temperaments. Despite Mrs. Bundle's skepticism about the benefits of learning Latin, the narrator's progress in the language was evident, leading to a fond gesture of a Latin valentine that greatly pleased Mrs. Bundle. The narrator's learning extended beyond Latin to arithmetic, geography, and improved handwriting, all thanks to the guidance and affection of Mr. Andrewes, the Rector. The narrator found solace in Mr. Andrewes' company, cherishing the bond they shared until circumstances changed their dynamic.

"""It always seems to me,"" he said one day, when my father and I were together at the Rectory, ""that there are two kinds of learning more neglected than they should be in the education of the young.

Mr. Andrewes continued to show interest in my garden, guiding me beyond childish gardening habits. I progressed to helping in the large flower garden, a joy for my father who cherished his flowers. Working with him in the garden, accompanied by Rubens, our dog, guarding my father's coat, were some of my happiest moments. We had a friendly competition with the Rectory, which intrigued me greatly. Occasionally, I assisted Mr. Andrewes directly, and he rewarded me with plants and wise counsel, often shared in quirky rhymes. Sadly, Mr. Andrewes had to relinquish my education to focus on parish duties. He persuaded my father to hire a resident tutor to prepare me for public school. Mr. Clerke, a fair, short-sighted man, became my tutor, introducing a new chapter in my education.|"1. What did Mr. Andrewes reward the speaker with for assisting him in the garden?

Mrs. Bundle was quite upset with the Rector for not encouraging her dear one, who had to deal with dead leaves, weeds, and stones on the road daily without being allowed to touch them. She couldn't understand why a tutor wouldn't intervene.

He confided in me about his plans to become a clergyman and how the Rector influenced his views on the sacred office. Our Sunday afternoons were spent discussing religious matters and enjoying gooseberries in the kitchen-garden. Mr. Clerke's interactions with the Rector elevated his aspirations, aiming for holiness and a deep commitment to parish work.

During my childhood, Mr. Clerke's generosity filled our alms-box, even though he had limited means. I compared our contributions to the widow's mite in a Sunday lesson.

Inspired by a neighboring parish's charitable trip, Mr. Clerke proposed a holiday for our scholars and teachers. The community supported the idea, and we decided on a trip to Oakford, urged by an elderly farmer's nostalgic tales. His vivid descriptions of Oakford Grange captivated us, despite skepticism. With the Grange possibly closing to the public, we embarked on our adventure to witness its wonders.|"1. What did Mr. Clerke do with a portion of his donations?

I visited the tinsmith's shop with Jemima, who was delighted by my presence. She gifted me a small tin lantern that caught my eye. Although tempted, I did not take a flat iron, as I was too old for playthings and too young for keepsakes. Mrs. Buckle couldn't recall the two beaver-bonneted girls. On our way to join the group, Mr. Clerke spotted a quaint village church. A group of us, intrigued by churches, explored the old, worn church. The walls were dirty, the pews high, and the tombs and figures inside seemed to crumble. The churchwarden suggested a whitewash to spruce it up. The churchwarden shared stories of the church's past, but Mr. Andrewes called us away. A marble tablet commemorated the St. John family members, including Amy and Lucy, adding a touch of pathos to the desolate church.

A marble tablet commemorated the St. John family members, including Amy and Lucy, adding a touch of pathos to the desolate church. My mind was preoccupied with thoughts of the children as we headed back to Dacrefield.|"4. What did the churchwarden suggest to spruce up the old church?

They always came true. Wait for me, I'll be back soon,"" I said, rushing to my room. I knelt down and prayed with all my heart to stop what I saw as a terrible tragedy.
