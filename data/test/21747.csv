In a short time, they arrived at the small shingly beach where Quintal had left the boat. They faced the challenge of navigating through the strong surf that had brought them ashore. The main risk was the boat being caught sideways by the waves, but they managed to keep it straight by rowing hard.

The ship was brought close to the cliffs for a unique debarkation the next morning. The crew managed to get the animals safely ashore, with the goats and fowls cooperating better than the stubborn hogs.|"1.

In a short time, they arrived at the small shingly beach where Quintal had left the boat. They faced the challenge of navigating through the strong surf that had brought them ashore. The main risk was the boat being caught sideways by the waves, but they managed to keep it straight by rowing hard. Fletcher Christian, the strongest and most skilled rower, steered with an oar instead of the rudder. They expertly maneuvered through the waves, with Christian's precise steering guiding them safely. After a tense moment, they reached the Bounty. They then prepared to land on the island's only bay. The ship was anchored, and the women and a little girl were sent ashore to set up camp. The ship was brought close to the cliffs for a unique debarkation the next morning. The crew managed to get the animals safely ashore, with the goats and fowls cooperating better than the stubborn hogs.|"3. How did Fletcher Christian steer the boat through the strong waves?

Firstly, they refused to leave the enclosures they had tried so hard to escape from during the voyage. To overcome this, Christian ordered the enclosures to be torn down, using the planks to persuade the stubborn animals. The uproar from the hogs was deafening as they were prodded and pushed towards the gangway. McCoy and Quintal stood out, forcefully moving the animals, some even falling into the sea. Meanwhile, the ship was infested with cats brought to control rats. The chaos ensued as the crew, with a cacophony of sounds, chased the felines out. The cats, startled, fled to the rigging and deck, creating havoc before finally being evicted. Eventually, the mutineers unloaded all useful items from the ship to the island, deciding to burn the vessel to avoid detection.|"1.

Some of the others agreed with Christian. Quintal, who always objected to being hanged, strongly supported destroying the ship. After much delay and discussion, the ship _Bounty_ was burned to the water's edge in Bounty Bay on January 23, 1790. The lower part of the vessel, which wouldn't burn, was towed out and sunk. All was busy as they settled on a spot inland for their camp. They cleared the ground and felled trees. A party, including Christian, Adams, Brown, Martin, and four Otaheitans, explored the island, finding evidence of past inhabitants. They climbed to the mountain peak for a bird's-eye view, seeing a vast expanse of ocean and a serene sky. The island's resources were plentiful, hinting at its past habitation.|"1.

Just then a loud and hideous cry came from what seemed like deep within the earth, shattering the peaceful silence. The cry, though loud, had a muffled quality and echoed in repetition. Christian and his group hurried towards the sound. As they approached a rocky area near the peak, the cry transformed into Martin's voice. They found Martin's leg trapped in a hole. With combined effort, they freed him and discovered the hole led to a cave with a stunning view of the sea. They explored the island, finding fertile lands mixed with rugged mountains. McCoy and Quintal nearly fought over tobacco until Christian intervened. The group then learned that a child was missing.

The group split up into the forest, each moving in a straight line, widening their search as they ventured further. Time was running out as night approached. The anxious mother and a few others waited in the clearing, hoping to hear a shout of success. After a while, they heard noise from the livestock hidden in the bush, but no shout yet. Christian's search led him through ferns and startled a hog, causing a commotion. He disturbed cats and finally found Sally and her pet goat asleep in a sunny spot. As morning dawned, John Adams woke up under the leafy canopy, surrounded by huts made by his comrades and the native wives. Mainmast, a graceful native, was preparing breakfast with a hog shot by Christian the night before. The slow cooking process prompted the early start.|"1.

The ship Mainmast started by lighting a fire and heating stones for an oven made by digging a hole in the ground. Plantain leaves lined the hole, and the hot stones were placed inside. The pig was cooked on the stones, covered with more leaves, and buried in the ground to retain heat. Meanwhile, Sally woke up and explored the morning. She wore a natural light-brown skin garment and was given coconut milk to keep her content. Sally then wandered off to Isaac Martin's hut and playfully tweaked his nose, causing laughter among the group. Martin then went down to the sea with a frying pan, returning to the fire where the group chatted and smoked.

Williams proposed a sinister plan to poison their fellow mutineers, inspired by a story from Otaheite. Menalee, a willing accomplice, made three puddings, one of which was laced with poison. Talaloo, suspecting foul play, cleverly avoided eating the poisoned pudding. Menalee then suggested they move to the bushes, where he attempted to shoot Talaloo but missed. A fierce struggle ensued between the two men until Talaloo was overpowered and killed. Timoa, who showed indifference to the murder, joined Menalee in hunting down and killing another mutineer named Ohoo.

The cyclone, though frightening, didn't stop the Dumplin' picnic. It only delayed it. Once the weather cleared, the event went on. Thursday asked who'd go by land or water. John Adams hinted that Sally might go by land, but he wasn't sure. Adams planned to go by water for deep-sea fishing with Sarah Quintal. Dan McCoy wanted to improve his fishing skills and offered to paddle. Adams chuckled quietly, agreeing but jokingly asked him to swim alongside. As they headed down the cliffs, they found the women preparing food while the children played by the waves. Ned Quintal, the best slider, dashed into the sea with a board, skillfully riding the waves. Billy Young attempted but lost his board, left behind as Ned rode a wave back to shore.|"1.
