Uncle Pennywait explained the first steps to creating a garden to Hal and Mab. He mentioned that for small gardens, spading is suitable, but for larger areas like farms, a plow is necessary. Mr. Blake, their neighbor, used a plow to prepare his garden, which fascinated the children. The plow turns over the soil, bringing the nutrient-rich undersoil to the surface for better plant growth. After plowing, the ground is harrowed with an iron-tooth harrow to smooth it out. The children learned that worms in the garden help aerate the soil, making it easier for plants to grow. Sammie, a red-haired boy, mistook the plow for a creature and ran away but fell down, showing resilience by getting back up.|"1. What did Uncle Pennywait mention as suitable for small gardens?

This is a place where a mole has dug his tunnel in the night to get things to eat. Moles dig deep down, too, under the surface where no one can see them, and when they do not uproot the grass or the garden plants, they do little harm. It is only when they come near the top that you can see the ridge they make. Sometimes cats catch moles when they come out on top of the ground, thinking them a sort of mouse. The mole's fur is very fine and soft and would make a fine cloak, only it would take many skins to make one large enough to wear. Mr. Blake had planted two kinds of potatoes, early and late, and it was the vines of the early ones that had dried up. Later on, the others would dry, and then it would be time to dig their tubers to put down cellar for the long Winter. First, you pull up the vine, and then with a potato hook, Daddy Blake began scraping away the dirt from the side of the hill of potatoes. When a farmer has a big field of potatoes, he may use a machine potato-digger. This is drawn by horses, who walk between the rows, drawing the machine right over where the potato vines are growing. The machine has iron prongs which dig under the dirt like giant fingers, turning out the potatoes which are tossed between the rows of dirt so men, who follow, may pick them up.
