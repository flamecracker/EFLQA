By this time, the Laughing Brook had stopped its joyful laughter, and the Smiling Pool barely held enough water for the minnows to feel secure. Billy Mink had ceased mocking the dam, causing worry among the small creatures residing in the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool. Paddy the Beaver had warned them of his plans, assuring them that once his pond was sufficiently large, the water would return to the Laughing Brook. Despite their attempts to trust him, there lingered a hint of doubt due to his unfamiliarity. Jerry Muskrat, however, remained confident that everything would turn out fine, likely because Paddy was his cousin. As the days passed, the dam and pond expanded. One morning, Grandfather Frog heard a delightful sound—the Laughing Brook's merry laughter had returned. Paddy had kept his promise, and water once again filled the Smiling Pool. The following day, Farmer Brown's boy, unaware of the changes, headed to the Smiling Pool for a fishing trip. Upon arrival, he was astonished to find the once vibrant pool reduced to mud and barely a trickle of water. It was a sight he had never witnessed before, and the absence of the Laughing Brook's usual babble added to the surreal scene.|"1.

By this time, the Laughing Brook had stopped its joyful laughter, and the Smiling Pool barely held enough water for the minnows to feel secure. Billy Mink had ceased mocking the dam, causing worry among the small creatures residing in the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool. Paddy the Beaver had warned them of his plans, assuring them that once his pond was sufficiently large, the water would return to the Laughing Brook. Despite their attempts to trust him, there lingered a hint of doubt due to his unfamiliarity. Jerry Muskrat, however, remained confident that everything would turn out fine, likely because Paddy was his cousin. As the days passed, the dam and pond expanded. One morning, Grandfather Frog heard a delightful sound—the Laughing Brook's merry laughter had returned. Paddy had kept his promise, and water once again filled the Smiling Pool. The following day, Farmer Brown's boy, unaware of the changes, headed to the Smiling Pool for a fishing trip. Upon arrival, he was astonished to find the once vibrant pool reduced to mud and barely a trickle of water. It was a sight he had never witnessed before, and the absence of the Laughing Brook's usual babble added to the surreal scene.|"2. Why did the small creatures residing in the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool worry about Billy Mink's actions?
