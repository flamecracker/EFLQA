If we had to choose between birds and quadrupeds, most of us would likely choose to keep the four-footed animals. Losing them would be a greater disaster than losing fish. Quadrupeds provide a larger portion of our food supply and contribute to our comfort and needs in many ways. Most nations value animals with hoofs, horns, and even claws. Laws now forbid cruelty to animals, and their destruction would be horrifying. While life would become more challenging without quadrupeds, it would still be possible with fish and fowl as a limited meat source. However, if birds were completely destroyed, insect populations would explode and threaten all plant and animal life, including humans. Birds are essential to control insect populations and maintain the balance of nature. Their preservation is crucial not only for sentiment but also for the practical benefits they provide in protecting our ecosystems.|"1. What is the main reason most people would choose to keep quadrupeds over birds?

The brown thrush, once abundant in this area, is now scarce. A local farmer recalls a time when the treetops were filled with their melodic songs, but now only hears a few each season. Despite finding three nests last May, they were destroyed before hatching, leaving the birds silent. The clearing of forests and settlement of the land have contributed to their decline, but a major factor is the use of bird feathers and skins for fashion. The cruel practice of using dead birds for adornment has led to the demise of many songbirds. The wanton destruction of birds for fashion and sport is a tragic loss to our ecosystems. Let's hope for a shift in societal values to protect these beautiful and beneficial creatures.|"1. What has contributed to the decline of brown thrush in the area?

Continue working on these inquiries until each student can provide a somewhat accurate depiction of the bird's appearance and movements. Encourage older students to write this down, as it will serve as a valuable language exercise. The subsequent questions should focus on the bird's lifestyle and traits. What does it consume? Offer crumbs or meat scraps to observe its eating habits. What noises does it produce? Can it sing? Try to mimic its sounds. Assess its temperament based on its actions. Is it brave? Aggressive? Does it tend to fight? Is it selfish? Often, a single event in a bird's life can answer several of these queries. For instance, observing two sparrows engaged in a tug-of-war over a straw can reveal much about their behavior. Encourage students to pay attention to sparrows' flight directions in early March to witness nest-building behaviors. They will notice variations in nest construction styles and locations, providing insights into the birds' habits throughout the breeding season. Following a similar approach with other bird species can lead to even more fascinating discoveries.|"1.

Continue working on these inquiries until each student can provide a somewhat accurate depiction of the bird's appearance and movements. Encourage older students to write this down, as it will serve as a valuable language exercise. The subsequent questions should focus on the bird's lifestyle and traits. What does it consume? Offer crumbs or meat scraps to observe its eating habits. What noises does it produce? Can it sing? Try to mimic its sounds. Assess its temperament based on its actions. Is it brave? Aggressive? Does it tend to fight? Is it selfish? Often, a single event in a bird's life can answer several of these queries. For instance, observing two sparrows engaged in a tug-of-war over a straw can reveal much about their behavior.

"During January, various birds like the flicker, crow, purple finch, and more visit feeders. Sparrow hawks and sharp-shinned hawks may also come for prey. A sparrow hawk was spotted in a city, hunting sparrows. In New York, a female sparrow hawk lived on English sparrows. A sharp-shinned hawk once fed on sparrows in a yard. As spring nears, more birds arrive. A girl identified 17 bird species in her yard in April. She fed chipping sparrows, who returned with their young. Another child had scarlet tanagers and rose-breasted grosbeaks nest in their yard. Bluebirds are azure blue with a pleasing warble. Chickadees have a familiar ""chic-a-dee-dee"" call. Catbirds are slate-colored with a cat-like cry. Meadow larks have a plaintive whistle and nest in open fields. Barn swallows have glossy steel blue upper parts and nest in barns."|"1.

Encourage your group of explorers to observe birds closely, jotting down their findings in a notebook for comparison later. This method helps improve the speed and accuracy of observation. There are two ways to approach birds: first, find a spot where birds have been spotted and quietly wait for them to come close. Some shy birds may even approach within a few feet. By imitating bird sounds like an owl or using specific calls, you can attract various birds for a closer look. The second method involves quietly following a bird to study its behavior, like watching a shore lark feed on insects. Even in urban areas, parks offer opportunities to observe and befriend birds. For example, Central Park in New York and Boston Common are known for their diverse bird populations.|"1. What is one method suggested in the text for observing birds closely?

Mr. E. H. Forbush, an expert on birds from the Board of Agriculture of Massachusetts, found that chickadees play a vital role in controlling harmful insects. For instance, four chickadees were discovered to have consumed over 1,000 eggs of the cankerworm. Another four birds of the same species had eaten about 600 eggs and 105 female moths of the cankerworm. This means that each chickadee could potentially destroy around 138,750 eggs of this harmful insect during the time the moths are active. Similarly, the pamphlet from the Department of Agriculture of the United States highlights how birds like the cuckoo and woodpecker are beneficial to ecosystems. The cuckoo, often misunderstood, eats caterpillars and hairy insects that other birds avoid. Woodpeckers are skilled at locating and consuming wood-boring insects, helping to preserve trees. Even the crow, often seen as a pest, contributes positively by feeding on destructive insects like beetles and grasshoppers. These examples emphasize the importance of birds in maintaining a balanced ecosystem by controlling harmful insect populations.|"1. What did Mr. E. H. Forbush find about chickadees in relation to controlling harmful insects?

Starting in March, keep a record for a few days of the various bird species you spot that were not seen the day before. Make two observations daily, one in the morning and one after school. Determine when you see more new birds, in the morning or afternoon. If your area is quiet, listen for bird sounds at night. You can do this close to home. Do robins have more than one set of chicks in a season? Do they reuse nests? What happens to the first brood when the mother is incubating eggs for the second? Watch a robin guiding its young. Observe how the parent feeds and teaches the fledglings to sing. Many birds sing at night, such as the female robin calling to her partner. Note the songs heard at night and try to understand why they sing then. Identify the female's call from the male's song. Find a pair of birds constructing a nest, often robins. Differentiate between male and female birds by appearance and voice. Observe their nest-building roles and materials used. Analyze which bird leads in building, who protects the mate, and if the other bird carries materials or acts as an escort. Write down your conclusions based on your observations. After the young birds leave the nest, examine it closely. Note the variations in nest materials used by different bird species. Birds seem to adapt materials available to build nests, showing they use reasoning rather than just instinct.|"1. What is the purpose of keeping a record of bird species in the text passage?

We kindly request that you cease this harmful action and spare us from this unfortunate destiny. You have already enacted a law protecting harmless songbirds and their nests and eggs. Could you please establish another law preventing the wearing of our feathers, so we are not killed for them? We want to keep our feathers for ourselves. Your beautiful girls are already lovely without them. It is said that it would be as effortless for you to do this as for a blackbird to sing. If you do, we will repay you a hundredfold. We will teach your children cleanliness and neatness, how to live harmoniously like we do in our nests. We will build charming houses you will enjoy seeing. We will frolic in your garden, like winged flowers, at no cost to you. We will help rid your cherry, currant, plum, apple, and rose plants of harmful insects. We will sing our best songs for you, making spring more delightful and summer sweeter. Every June morning, orioles, bluebirds, blackbirds, and bobolinks will follow you, enhancing your day. When you return home tired, the vesper sparrow will express our gratitude. As you relax on your porch at night, the fifebird, hermit thrush, and wood thrush will serenade you, and the whip-poor-will will bring you solace. We know where we are safe. Soon, all birds will return to Massachusetts, and all music lovers will|"1. What is the main request of the birds in the passage?

The Bird Day initiative is now supported by the United States Government for economic reasons, benefiting future generations by fostering a love for birds. The natural inclination to appreciate and observe birds will be nurtured rather than ignored. These winged creatures no longer shy away from humans, but instead gather around, allowing children to interact with them fearlessly. The kingbird, with a length of about eight and a half inches and a wingspan of fourteen and a half inches, has blackish ash upper parts, a black head, and a concealed orange-red patch on its crown. Its pure white lower parts are tinged with pale bluish ash. The male kingbird, characterized by the name _tyrannus_, fiercely defends its territory during breeding season, particularly against hawks and crows. These birds are valuable to farmers as they protect crops by preying on harmful insects. The kingbird's nest is made of twigs and grasses, usually placed among tree branches. They lay four to five white, brown-spotted eggs and typically have two broods annually. The flicker, with a length of nine and a half inches and an eighteen-inch wingspan, has a crimson head and neck, black crescent on the breast, and black-glossed blue back, wings, and tail. Their nests are built in various trees, and they feed on wood lice, ants, and other ground insects. Woodpeckers, like the flicker, play a crucial role in preserving|"1.

The red-headed woodpecker constructs its nest at the base of a tunnel in a tree, either dug by other birds or adapted from an existing cavity. The nest is a simple pile of soft, decaying wood, with more focus on protection from rain than cleanliness. The eggs are white with reddish-brown speckles, typically six in a clutch. This woodpecker has a crested head, light purplish-blue crest and upper back, bright blue wings and tail, and a black collar that curves gracefully from the head down each side of the neck. The blue jay's nest, on the other hand, is large and clumsily made, perched high in tall trees, often cedars. The female blue jay is slightly smaller than the male, with olive eggs speckled with brown. The male blue jay has a black head, large yellowish patch on the back of the neck, and sharp-pointed tail feathers. In autumn, the male's colors become more pronounced.
