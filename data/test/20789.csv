They covered the hole with boards and dirt, then replaced the sod on top. They created an entrance by leaving a square hole in the roof and made a door from a square board. Inside, they built a stove by digging into the wall and connecting it to a hole for a chimney. They added a floor with old boards and boarded the walls. Finally, they furnished it with an old table and chairs, making it a cozy camp. The boys discussed the idea of making a similar camp in the woods in spring.
