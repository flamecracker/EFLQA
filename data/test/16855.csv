Ariel was sure that her family and community were unaware of her discovery. She suggested to Ashman that they hide in the mysterious cave until the danger passed. She thought if they weren't found soon, people would assume they had chosen to end their lives together, stopping the pursuit. Ashman agreed with Ariel's plan. He pushed the canoe far out onto the lake to avoid leaving a clue. As they cautiously navigated the dense vegetation that thrived without sunlight, they found the entrance Ariel had described. The opening was just wide enough for them to pass through by stooping slightly. Ashman led with his Winchester ready, followed closely by Ariel. As they moved deeper into the cavern, the light increased, revealing a vast space with towering stalactites and stalagmites. The lovers encountered a ledge that led further into the cave, covered in sparkling points of light that Ashman suspected were valuable minerals. Ariel explained that these were similar to diamonds she had seen her people mine by the lake. The scene was breathtaking, with enough wealth to change nations.|"1.
