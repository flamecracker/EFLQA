He explained the process of sugar production, starting from the tall sugar cane plants with broad leaves to the extraction of juice through crushing rollers. The liquid then went through evaporation and crystallization before being separated into sugar and molasses. Finally, the sugar was dried, packed, and sent to refineries for further processing. This was an eye-opening experience for the boys, learning about the intricate process behind something as simple as sugar.|"2. Where did the raw sugar come from according to the superintendent?

Sugar refining plants are not found everywhere due to the high cost of building them. It is more practical to have these plants in large cities with good shipping facilities for receiving raw sugar and distributing the refined product. Each plantation does not need its own mill, as smaller growers may not produce enough to operate one. Instead, a central mill in a sugar district allows growers to bring their crop for processing in bulk, saving time and money. The cane is stripped of leaves before shipping, and the stalks are crushed to extract the juice. Raw sugar is usually transported to refineries by water, but during times of scarcity, like in the Great War, alternative methods like overland train transport may be used, affecting sugar prices. Mr. Hennessey emphasizes the interconnectedness of global trade and the importance of world peace for prosperity. The United States is a significant consumer of sugar, with even the poorer classes able to afford it for household use. Moderation in sugar consumption is advised for health benefits.|"1.

Mr. Hennessey pointed out that to make sugar successfully, it is crucial to prevent fermentation by stirring it constantly with paddles. Cleanliness is key, ensuring vats and equipment are spotless. The process involves washing walls with lime to maintain freshness. Making cane sugar is manageable if done carefully and correctly. Skilled chemists oversee the process, testing liquid samples to ensure quality. Crystallization follows, requiring precision to regulate crystal size. Expertise is needed to determine the right moment for crystallization. The sugar is then spun in centrifugal machines to remove liquid, leaving dry crystals. Dust is blown off, and the sugar is packaged. Automatic machines fill boxes with precise weights, sealed by workers. The sugar is packed for distribution to stores. Mr. Hennessey acknowledged the complexity but emphasized the importance of attention to detail in sugar-making.|"1.
