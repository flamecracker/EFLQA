At Plum Beach, there's a sandbar outside the cove that has grown, creating another beach with real surf. This means we can enjoy different types of bathing experiences. One day we can relax on the calm beach, and the next we can ride the waves. The idea of having both options excites me. Reading books used to get me in trouble with Maw Hoover. She thought I was loafing and always found more chores for me. But books are so much fun! You should try reading the right kind of books, Dolly. When we return to the city, let's read good books together. Plum Beach is not your typical seaside spot with hotels and boardwalks. It's wild and beautiful, just ten miles from Bay City. The beach is pristine, and the seafood is amazing. We can catch sea bass, dig for clams, and have a blast crabbing. Plum Beach is a secluded paradise where we can truly unwind and enjoy nature's bounty.|"4. How does the speaker feel about reading books?
