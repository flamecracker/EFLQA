The boy hesitantly shared his tale, not an unusual one. He had journeyed most of the way on foot, working odd jobs for farmers and shopkeepers. Admitting to spending several weeks on the road, he revealed that he ended up in the hollow stump in Hiram Bassett's field by chance. While passing through the field towards the main road, he spotted Ruth, Helen, and Tom, and hid behind a tree to avoid being seen. Ruth returned to the kitchen after her friends left, noticing a newspaper clipping drying on the window sill. She picked up Fred Hatfield's father's old wallet left on the table by Mr. Cameron, dried it, and placed the clipping back inside. Curiosity led her to read the article, causing her face to pale. Ruth concealed the clipping in her dress as Aunt Alvirah entered, trying to compose herself. Throughout supper preparation, Ruth remained unusually quiet. Uncle Jabez Potter, a stern man who rarely smiled, arrived from the mill. Despite his austere demeanor, Ruth had discovered his kinder side, especially through his generosity towards her and others, like Mercy Curtis. Aunt Alvirah reassured Uncle Jabez about the boy's presence, explaining his condition and the need to warm him up.|"1. What did the boy do most of the way during his journey?

Fred glanced at Ruth and continued running. The engineer whistled for the flagman's return, but no one, not even the train crew or the private car passengers, noticed the boy and girl who had left the train carelessly. Ruth, focused on following Fred, didn't see the rear brakeman's lantern approaching. Quickly, he jumped onto the private car as the train started moving. Desperate to escape Ruth, Fred leaped onto a timber wagon, expertly handling the mules. Ruth, frightened, realized the danger as the mules sped away. Fred, skilled with mules, managed to control them as they journeyed through the deep woods.

Ruth was worried about what her friends would think if they couldn't find her, and how she would return to the railroad. Would Mr. Cameron come looking for her? Her thoughts were interrupted by a wild scream from the bushes nearby. The mules stopped abruptly, startled by the noise. A panther had leaped down from a tree, causing panic. Ruth remembered seeing a panther at a circus and was terrified by its sleek, menacing presence. The mules galloped in fear, narrowly avoiding a direct encounter with the panther. The cat leaped onto the wagon but struggled to hold on as the mules sped through the woods. As they reached a fork in the road, the mules veered onto a narrow, bumpy path, shaking off the panther. The wild cat leaped off the wagon and disappeared into the bushes.|"1. What startled the mules and Ruth in the text passage?

Fred swiftly attempted to calm the mules down to reduce their speed, but only exhaustion could slow them. Terrified, the mules kept bolting without reason, and the narrow road offered no space to steer them. The steep ascent of the road was the main factor in slowing the runaway mules. The path hugged the edge of steep cliffs, posing a threat to the wagon, mules, and passengers had they tumbled over. These perilous spots had initially scared young Hatfield, who knew the area well. Ruth, however, was doubly terrified as she felt completely lost. Fred yelled at the mules to halt, and they eventually paid heed, perhaps due to fatigue. A light suddenly shone ahead, guiding them through the darkness. Ruth, fearful of the forest's unknown dangers, bravely confronted Fred, who appeared more cowardly than menacing. The barking dogs quieted down as a light emanated from a nearby hut. An elderly hermit with a rifle emerged, observing Ruth and Fred with curiosity.|"1.

Ruth quickly summarized her adventure without mentioning Fred Hatfield's troubles. They had hopped onto a timber cart at the crossing, the mules bolted, a panther hitched a ride, and now they were here! The old man promised to take her home before bedtime. Ruth headed to his house while the boy helped with the mules. The old man chatted mostly to himself, barely looking at Ruth. The dogs, Tiger and Rose, welcomed her warmly. As she entered the cozy log cabin, a strange odor lingered. In a dark corner, a green chest with a window cover rustled. Ruth sat by the fire, flanked by the dogs. The old man prepared tea and cornbread, then startled Ruth by revealing two harmless snakes he kept as pets.|"1. What did Ruth and Fred Hatfield hop onto at the crossing?
