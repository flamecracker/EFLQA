Meanwhile, the other black man and a sailor were instructed to care for the ill black servant until help arrived. Dr. Solander, once warmed by the fire, sent two strong men back to retrieve the missing black man. Sadly, the men returned alone, unable to locate their companions.

Meanwhile, the other black man and a sailor were instructed to care for the ill black servant until help arrived. Dr. Solander, once warmed by the fire, sent two strong men back to retrieve the missing black man. Sadly, the men returned alone, unable to locate their companions. It was later discovered that the missing bottle of rum, likely carried by one of the absent men, had been used to revive the servant. In the darkness and heavy snowfall, hope dwindled for their safe return. Eventually, a shout was heard, and one of the seamen was found barely standing. Despite efforts to rescue the others, the party was too weak. The night passed in anguish and distress, with two dead, one gravely ill, and the rest on the brink of collapse. Miraculously, a gentle breeze cleared the sky, allowing them to journey back to safety, surviving on a meager vulture meal. This land, similar to our southern hemisphere, is harsh and inhabited by a desolate native population.|"5. What allowed the party to journey back to safety?

The savage people living on the islands near Tierra del Fuego had a unique appearance with rust-colored skin and long black hair. The men were tall but clumsy, while the women were smaller and wore animal skins. Despite their poverty, they enjoyed adorning themselves with face paint and beads made of shells and bones. These people had no government or religion and spoke in a harsh language. Captain Cook and his crew later discovered coral islands in the Pacific Ocean, where they encountered natives who were brown-skinned and carried long spears. The islands had diverse landscapes with rocky areas, vegetation, and palm trees. The crew marveled at the paradise-like scenery after months at sea. Another island shaped like a bow was also found, inhabited by natives who were hesitant to approach the ship.|"1. What was the unique appearance of the savage people living near Tierra del Fuego?

The birth of an island begins with the demise of the coral insects, forming a ring emerging from the sea. Other creatures join in, as waves break the coral cells into sand, and ocean currents bring seaweed and debris. Winds carry land plant seeds, while seabirds contribute to the island's growth. Over time, a lush vegetation covers the island, attracting South Sea islanders. The coral reefs surrounding these islands pose dangers to ships, causing unexpected wrecks. Despite the risks, the corallines create natural harbors with splendid calm waters shielded by the reefs. These openings in the reefs serve as safe passages into the harbors, often found opposite valleys where freshwater prevents coral growth. Otaheite, now known as Tahiti, captivated Captain Cook with its beauty when he arrived in 1769. Tahiti's discovery marked a significant event, with the natives in awe of the first ship to visit their shores.|"1. What is the primary cause of the birth of an island in the text passage?

There was a lot of chatter among the natives before they felt comfortable. They were given trinkets and gradually their fears eased under Captain Wallis' kindness. However, a ship's goat attacked one of the natives, causing a commotion. The goat's actions led to the natives fleeing into the sea.

The teacher, with his subject lying down, picks up his tool. It is a small stick with sharp bird or fish bones attached. After drawing the intended tattoo pattern with charcoal, he dips the bone points in a jet-black dye from the candle-nut kernel. He applies it to the skin and taps it with a stick, puncturing the skin and injecting the dye. The teacher works calmly and artistically, continuing until the patient can't bear the pain. The patterns vary among islanders, featuring lines, palm trees, and animals on the face and body. Tahitian tattooing is simpler and more elegant, with nature-inspired designs like coconut trees. The ankle and instep tattoos resemble Eastern sandals, and leg tattoos create the illusion of ornamental pants. The chest is heavily tattooed with various figures, from trees to weapons. Women also tattoo but with more tasteful designs. Tahiti, once savage, is now civilized, with Christianity replacing their old customs and superstitions.|"1.

The dog was then cut up and cooked in the ground with hot stones and leaves for about four hours. The natives also enjoy a variety of raw fish, lobsters, crabs, and breadfruit.

In battles of ancient times, the capture of a wounded enemy was seen as a sacrifice. The wounded warrior, still alive, was adorned with sacred cinet and laid on spears while the priest watched. If a tear fell, it was believed he wept for his land; if he clenched his fist, his party would resist fiercely. When a chief fell, his comrades regrouped and launched a furious counterattack. Skilled slingers then pelted stones at close range, causing havoc. As the armies clashed, the fight grew fierce until one side retreated.

"In ancient times, fierce battles were fought on the waters of the Pacific islands. One memorable clash occurred between the people of Huahine and Raiatea, resulting in a staggering loss of life. Ninety war-canoes, each over a hundred feet long, clashed near Hooroto, leading to a brutal and unyielding fight. The casualties were so high that the dead were stacked as tall as young coconut trees the next day. These conflicts birthed what we now call ""wild men"" who roamed the island mountains. These individuals, driven mad by war, lived in solitude for years. Their appearance was striking, with long, disheveled hair of varying colors and a wild, agitated demeanor. Captured by surprise, they exhibited extreme terror and resistance, haunted by the horrors of war. The captors' kindness failed to calm their fears, and they longed for escape. The cruelties inflicted on prisoners were unspeakably gruesome, with some bodies left to be consumed by animals. The victors even fashioned trophies from the bones of the fallen."|"1.

"Upon arrival, the war-party encountered the natives who were taunting and challenging them. The natives expressed their impatience, stating they had long awaited the visit and were now ready to engage. They warned the war-party that they were armed with stones, gunpowder, and musket-balls. In response, the war-party exchanged similar insults. Eventually, three hill dwellers dared the war-party to come up the path. The war-party, not intending to attack at that moment, declined but fired muskets at the challengers, killing them instantly.
