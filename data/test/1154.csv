It was an exciting and nerve-wracking moment. With our eyes tightly closed, I heard the atlas fall open with a loud bang. I pondered whether it was the map of England or Asia. The fate of our adventure depended on where the pencil would land. After waving three times in a circle, I slowly lowered my hand.

The Doctor, needing his glasses to read the tiny print, was astonished. He mentioned that it was the very island where Long Arrow was last seen. The Doctor expressed his amazement at the coincidence and the opportunity to study rare Jabizri beetles found only on Spidermonkey Island. He explained the challenges of locating the island precisely in the vast ocean but remained optimistic about the upcoming expedition.|"1. What was the title of the map where the pencil landed?

The next morning, two fidgits were discovered by the keeper floating lifeless in their tank. To avoid being mistaken for dead fish, they had to stay stiff and breathe silently through half-closed lips when taken out of the water for examination. Despite the risk of choking, they managed to sneak in a few breaths. A cat almost ruined their plan by trying to eat them, but the old men intervened just in time. The fidgits were spared from being thrown into an ash-barrel or the gutter as the keeper was stopped by a man in blue with silver buttons. Finally, they were returned to the harbor, where they felt relieved as the saltwater enveloped them, reviving them instantly. The old man's surprise led to a comical mishap, resulting in him being reprimanded for his actions by the man in blue.|"1. What did the fidgits have to do to avoid being mistaken for dead fish?

In the dense and tangled woods at the base of the hills, we faced the challenge of navigating through the thick undergrowth. Following Polynesia's advice, we avoided well-trodden paths to steer clear of encountering any locals.

As we ascended towards higher ground, the forest thinned, offering glimpses of breathtaking island vistas and the vast blue sea beyond. Dr. Dolittle's excitement peaked upon spotting a rare Jabizri beetle, capturing it with sheer determination despite the risk of a near-fall. His expertise in handling the beetle revealed a mysterious leaf wrapped around its leg, sparking curiosity and admiration among us.|"1. What challenge did the group face in the woods?

The Doctor, with the help of Long Arrow and the Indians, created fire in the dark using a squirrel's nest and wood. The room was lit up as the fire blazed, fascinating the Indians.

The Doctor then showed them how to take fire into their huts, bringing warmth to every home in the village. The Popsipetels were grateful for the fire, staying up late talking about the Doctor's magical abilities. The Doctor's popularity required him to work in secret to avoid constant attention. In addition to helping the plants and trees, they also found that the animals were suffering in the cold, with birds seeking warmer lands and land-crabs heading to the sea for a better habitat.|"1.

Some of the leaders spoke to the Popsipetels as we departed. Although their words were unclear to me, we noticed several canoes filled with Bag-jagderags following us at a safe distance back to Popsipetel. As we set off, we spotted a steep point on the coast where the sea churned with frothy waves. Approaching closer, we realized our loyal whales were nudging us northward. We had been so engrossed in the war that we had forgotten about them. Watching their powerful tails churn the sea, we felt a warmth despite the cold. Speeding up our boat to prevent losing sight of the island, we continued along the coast. Eventually, we landed halfway to Popsipetel and explored the heart of the island. The Indian paddlers guided us to the mountains, where they revealed the Whispering Rocks—a unique amphitheater-like formation with a table of rock and an ivory chair at the center. This was where the kings of Spidermonkey Island were crowned in the past. The guides also showed us a massive hanging stone perched on a volcano's crater, believed to hold a legend that it would fall into the volcano when the greatest king was crowned, causing the island to sink.|"1.

The study of plants, known as botany, was not something that initially intrigued me. I found it less captivating compared to the study of animals. However, as Long Arrow shared his collection of plants and their unique qualities, my interest grew. I was completely engrossed in the wonders of the Vegetable Kingdom that he presented. When Bumpo mistakenly consumed some seeds, the effects were remarkable. He laughed uncontrollably, and we had to put him to bed. Long Arrow also showed us red roots that could make people dance with incredible speed when made into a soup. Despite his offer, we declined after Bumpo's incident. Long Arrow's collection included various items like hair growth oil, a giant orange, black honey for sleep, and more with extraordinary properties. The Doctor was fascinated and noted down their details. The Doctor realized the potential of these discoveries in the field of medicine and chemistry. Despite the pleasant life on Spidermonkey Island, thoughts of England and his old life lingered in the Doctor's mind. He remained absorbed in caring for his family, but an accident and Polynesia would soon change his course.|"1. What initially made the narrator less interested in the study of plants?

E) Vegetable Kingdom wonders"|D) Red roots|
The study of plants, known as botany, was not something that initially intrigued me. I found it less captivating compared to the study of animals. However, as Long Arrow shared his collection of plants and their unique qualities, my interest grew. I was completely engrossed in the wonders of the Vegetable Kingdom that he presented. When Bumpo mistakenly consumed some seeds, the effects were remarkable. He laughed uncontrollably, and we had to put him to bed. Long Arrow also showed us red roots that could make people dance with incredible speed when made into a soup. Despite his offer, we declined after Bumpo's incident. Long Arrow's collection included various items like hair growth oil, a giant orange, black honey for sleep, and more with extraordinary properties. The Doctor was fascinated and noted down their details. The Doctor realized the potential of these discoveries in the field of medicine and chemistry. Despite the pleasant life on Spidermonkey Island, thoughts of England and his old life lingered in the Doctor's mind. He remained absorbed in caring for his family, but an accident and Polynesia would soon change his course.|"4. Why did the group decline Long Arrow's offer to make a soup with the red roots?
