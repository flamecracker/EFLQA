The narrow entrance to the cave barely allowed a man to pass through. Hamersley noticed smoke rising from a fire near the opening. Suddenly, falling debris filled the shaft, followed by suffocating smoke. Realizing it was toxic stink-weed smoke, they used a coat to block the entrance. They held the coat tightly to prevent the deadly fumes from entering. They remained silent, knowing the Indians above would wait until they were sure of their demise. The Indians hesitated, unsure if the men were in the shaft. The men endured the bitter smoke, relying on their wits to outsmart the Indians. The sounds of burning brush being thrown in stopped, signaling the Indians may think they had succeeded in their plan.|"5. Who hesitated, unsure if the men were in the shaft?

The red-skinned fumigators stopped their cruel task, leaving their victims in silence. Suddenly, a rumbling noise and a crash indicated something terrible. A thick substance oozed in, but it started thinning and rising like smoke up a chimney. As the danger seemed to pass, the fugitives cautiously considered leaving their shelter.

For a brief moment, Wilder's clever trick slowed down the pursuers. However, the Indians quickly caught on to the deception. As they split up to search the area, the tube and cap trick failed to fool them. They swiftly moved up the ravine, seizing Wilder's rifle and continuing their pursuit. They paused briefly at a red kerchief, suspicious of another trick. Splitting into two groups, one went left and the other right, eventually discovering the hiding spot of the fugitives. After confirming their location, they sealed off the hiding place with stones and fire, ensuring their demise.

Following the chief's orders, some gathered the bodies of their fallen comrades for burial. However, others, acting independently, continued to desecrate the white victims' bodies, mutilating them further. They decapitated the victims, impaling their heads on spears, tossing them around, and laughing maniacally. The intense anger from unexpected resistance led to this gruesome display. The bodies were subjected to brutal treatment, slashed with tomahawks, pierced with spears, and beaten with clubs. The scene turned bizarre when the contents of wagons were distributed among the group. The Horned Lizard oversaw the allocation, favoring himself and his companion with luxurious fabrics, while the rest settled for simpler items. The Indians then drank whisky from the caravan, leading to intoxication and a gambling game involving horse-tail tug-of-war to determine ownership of goods.|"1.

Some non-gamblers, driven by mischief and amusement, tie their belongings and race across the land, leaving tracks far behind. In their wild play, they forget their fallen comrades, still unburied. They cheer, yell, and laugh until the cliffs echo their demonic joy. A rare and original riot‚Äîa true savage revelry.

It wasn't an accidental cliff collapse, but a deliberate act‚Äîa massive rock rolled by the united strength of the savages to seal off a shaft. The two trapped men, resigned to their fate, understood they were entombed alive. The guide's futile attempts to move the rock revealed its immovability.

There are no tents in the camp; only a few blankets or buffalo robes stretched out horizontally on poles cut from the nearby trees. The shady canopy of the pecan trees shields the warriors from the intense rays of the midday sun shining straight down. The absence of tents indicates that they are on a raid. A peaceful group would have tents with them, but this encampment has only men, painted brightly from waist to head with various designs, some funny, others strange, and some even scary. It's clear they are on a return journey. Although there are no women or children in the camp, there are white women and children near the center, showing signs of captivity.

Approximately half of the band is part of this group. The others are residents of the looted village - the fathers, brothers, and husbands whose loved ones have been taken by the Horned Lizard and his gang. They are chasing the raiders, a pursuit that started as soon as they could gather enough strength for it to be successful.

The soldiers and settlers have combined forces and are now on the trail of the Tenawas, pausing briefly to rest, eat, and then continue. The urgency is understandable - their homes have been destroyed, their loved ones captured. Each person is consumed by worry for their family members. The settlers seek to rescue their kin, while the Rangers are motivated by a desire to avenge past defeats and protect against future incursions.

Walt quickly shared the harrowing tale with his former companions, introducing Hamersley as his companion in the perilous ordeal.

The Rangers unanimously agreed to support Hamersley's cause, seeing an opportunity to rescue friends and loved ones from danger.
