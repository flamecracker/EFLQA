Despite the challenges, the crew remained vigilant, using tarpaulins to shield the boats from swamping. After a stormy night, only one boat remained, with the crew realizing they were alone at sea. The men, despite their weariness, stayed alert, with some searching for matches to light their pipes, only to find none, leading to a sense of shared concern among the crew.|"5.

When I first laid eyes on him, I recognized him as an old friend and had him brought to our base in Traitor's Trap. He's been there ever since, in a fragile state due to the fall that seems to have harmed him internally, nearly breaking his neck. His recovery has been slow, and it appears his spine is injured. We've tried to convince him to join us once he's better, but he has consistently refused. I don't regret it, as I don't want to force anyone into this lifestyle, especially seeing his condition. We've faced setbacks recently, losing two of our best men to different pursuits. Luck seems to have turned away from us. Some might say God has forsaken us, but I believe that God never abandons us; it's when we turn away that we face obstacles.|"1.

At this point, the brave horse stumbled, nearly throwing off its rider. The rider, with angry words, spurred the horse fiercely, causing blood to mix with the foam. It was a rare sight to see the horse urged to such extreme efforts, reminiscent of a time when Captain Wilmot had to flee from danger. However, the Captain's urging had never been cruel, unlike now. The horse, gasping and sobbing, tried to climb the steep gorge, but the rider's unmerciful prodding only caused more distress. Unfortunately, the horse tripped over a root, sending the rider flying over its head. The rider, Jake, landed face-first, bloodied and stunned. As he tried to make the horse rise, it became clear the fall had broken its neck. This tragic event made even the thoughtless men consider the need for a Savior and reject the notion that animals have no future. Jake, with no time for regrets, cursed the horse and hurried up the glen, unaware that Black Polly and her master Hunky Ben were close behind. Hunky Ben, taking a shortcut, reached the outlaws' cave before Jake, revealing a hidden vantage point from which he observed the outlaws below. Hunky Ben's cunning and knowledge of the land allowed him to outmaneuver Jake, showcasing his strategic prowess.|"1. What caused the horse to stumble and nearly throw off its rider?
