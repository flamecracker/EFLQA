One man, Mr. Holman, expressed his opinions strongly but declined to volunteer, claiming he could manage the war better than the current leaders.

"Dear Mary,

I am practicing military drills and exercises diligently, aiming to improve rapidly. Besides my regular drills, I am receiving private lessons from my comrade Frank, who has been in the service for six months. This additional training will hopefully help me perform well in my evaluations within a month.

Writing this letter is challenging as I use my knapsack for a desk, sitting in an uncomfortable position. My comrades usually play cards for stakes, but I convinced them to stop to avoid any negative consequences. I miss you all greatly and look forward to your letters updating me on everything. Even small details will be a source of joy for us here.

Once, Mrs. Roberts passed through our dim, cramped room. I questioned her conduct, asking if it was honorable to deceive us with false promises and then hand us over to our foes.

She remains in custody. The campaign is set to begin when the roads dry up. The mud in Virginia is a significant obstacle. I hope General Grant succeeds in capturing Vicksburg, a blow to the rebels.
