The Native Americans had been tracking the group of plainsmen for days, waiting for a chance to strike. They both feared and despised the plainsmen but had never risked an attack in the open prairie. Now, stealthy figures emerged from the shadows, taking cover behind trees with the intent to unleash their marksmanship. The old Pottawatomie storyteller warned of ghostly figures lurking between the trees at night, but assured the listeners that the danger had long passed. The Indians, after seizing the treasure and massacring its protectors, allegedly buried the bullion in the lake before being driven out of the area. Despite multiple attempts to recover the treasure, including draining the lake, the bullion was never found. A visitor proposed a treasure hunt, with scouts mapping out sections of land to search systematically. As the scouts embark on the quest, they are reminded to watch for unique rock formations that may lead them to the hidden treasure.|"1.

The night grew cooler, the campfire illuminated the area, casting shadows. Glen, the candidate, was joined by a larger scout who symbolically passed the camp flag to him.

Once they entered the narrow passage, they found themselves in a cave. Light barely seeped in from the small opening, but the darkness above and behind them was impenetrable. A dense mass of something loomed ahead, which Apple, boldly swimming forward, identified as a pile of stones. Glen agreed they could keep this discovery to themselves for a while. They had stashed lanterns, a pick, and spades nearby, which they retrieved to explore further. The cave's floor was partially submerged in water flowing swiftly towards a counter opening. The cave was longer than they thought, with hidden openings further back. The most striking feature was a solid arch of masonry. They tried to move some big stones but realized it would be a lot of work. Apple imagined a procession of people carrying loads of stone, while Glen suggested they might have obtained the rocks from high ledges in the cave.|"1.
