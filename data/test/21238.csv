"The group of castaways had prayed for guidance and strength as they faced treacherous waters. With Captain Redwood skillfully steering the pinnace and Murtagh and the Malay rowing with all their might, they successfully navigated the dangerous passage. Once safely ashore in Borneo, they dropped to their knees, offering a heartfelt prayer of thanksgiving for their deliverance.

Saloo rushed back to the boat and returned with news of fresh water. The crew drank eagerly, feeling new life surge through them.

"Saloo set out to find another Singapore oyster; Murtagh wandered by the stream, hoping to lure the red and gold fish he spotted playing ""backgammon"" in it, reminiscent of the trout and salmon in his native Killarney.

While feeling anxious, the group pondered what to do about the boat that had brought them safely ashore. They feared it could attract unwanted attention if they left it out in the open. Dragging it into the trees was too strenuous a task given their weakened state. Murtagh suggested breaking it up, but Captain Redwood disagreed, valuing the boat's service. Saloo then spotted a solution in a nearby stream that could hide the boat. After a struggle, they managed to secure the boat in the stream under the cover of an overhanging tree. However, their peace was interrupted by Saloo's shout as they discovered a massive python descending from the tree above. The danger was imminent, and Murtagh's attempt to dodge the snake ended in a fall, leaving him vulnerable to the python's attack.|"1.

During their exploration, Saloo, armed with a boat-hook, quickly identified a false nest where the sand was disturbed by megapodes. This led them to a real nest nearby, filled with beautiful salmon-colored eggs. The group decided to cook and eat the fresher eggs first before moving on to the older ones left out in the sun. As they prepared to cook, they were startled by the sight of the eggs rolling on the ground and cracking open to reveal fully feathered chicks ready to fly. Saloo, understanding this phenomenon, swiftly prevented the chicks from escaping by using the boat-hook to stop their flight attempts. The group, surprised but satiated by the unexpected meal of chicks, realized the need for a more reliable food source for their journey ahead. Despite not finding larger animals like rhinoceros or tapirs for meat, they remained determined to secure provisions for their voyage.|"1. What did Saloo use to identify the false nest?

Captain Redwood and his ship-carpenter found themselves under the lethal upas tree, known for its poisonous breath. The tree's toxic vapors had caused them vertigo and nausea. Despite their suffering, the tropical sun and cool breeze revived them. They sat on the sand, gazing at the ocean and birds, grateful for their survival. Captain Redwood blamed their misfortune on carelessness, as he knew the dangers of the upas tree. The poison, while making them ill, was not fatal from inhalation alone. The upas tree's sap is deadly if ingested, used by natives for their weapons. Despite the danger, the upas tree belongs to the same family as the life-giving breadfruit tree, a curious contrast of life and death in nature.|"1.

The poison from the upas tree is prepared by mixing it with black pepper, galanga-root, and ginger. This thick juice, similar to molasses, can be preserved for a long time if kept away from the air. The upas tree is rare and not found in groups. Just like precious treasures, such as gold and diamonds, poisonous plants like the _antiaris toxicaria_ are scarce. The castaways, feeling invigorated by the fresh sea breeze, rested near a fig tree, a safe haven away from the poisonous upas. They cooked a meal of stewed old hen and chick, enjoying the fragrant aroma of the food. After a hearty meal, they relocated their camp to the shelter of the banyan tree, a sturdy and sacred tree known for its extensive roots and large canopy.|"1.

In the forest, the explorers encountered a large lizard, a _saurian_, crawling on a tree. Saloo, undeterred by its repulsive appearance, convinced Captain Redwood to shoot it for food. The reptile, a _Hydrosaurus_, was skinned and cooked, providing a meal akin to tender pork with a hint of chicken and frog. Additionally, a wild boar was hunted, yielding pork chops and hams for their journey. With their provisions secured, the group prepared to cross Borneo's wilderness towards civilisation, aware of the challenges and dangers ahead. The trek of approximately 250 miles would test their endurance and survival skills, but they were determined to overcome any obstacles they might encounter, including the need to forage for food in the dense forests. Saloo's creation of a blow-gun and arrows added to their arsenal for hunting along the way, ensuring they were equipped for the demanding journey ahead.|"1.

Saloo, a skilled sumpitan shooter from Sumatra, prepared his arrows with a deadly poison from the upas-tree and bina plant. This lethal coating ensured that any animal hit by his arrows would meet a swift end. With his provisions secured, Saloo led the party through the forest, avoiding encounters with savage tribes rumored to inhabit Borneo's interior. Despite the dangers, the group pressed on, wary of the mysterious and terrifying reputation of these wild tribes. The travelers followed a path beside a stream, guided by the hope that it would lead them westward. As they journeyed, they encountered traces of tapirs, wild boars, and rhinoceroses, but the creatures remained hidden in the jungle. Opting to leave their boat behind due to the challenging river conditions and the risk of being spotted by potential threats, the group continued on foot, eventually reaching the base of a formidable mountain range. The next day, they navigated a rocky ravine to ascend the mountain, reaching its summit at dusk.|"1. What was the purpose of Saloo coating his arrows with a deadly poison?

The crocodile, although crushed and no longer dangerous, was not killed. The red gorilla stood nearby, squatted and exulting over its victory. The spectators desired the horrid spectacle to end soon. The hunters were far off, and the siblings feared the gorilla might find them defenseless. They thought of firing a signal but worried it might attract the gorilla. They relied on Providence as they had in past dangers. The gorilla, satisfied with its triumph, prepared to leave. Suddenly, the gorilla turned towards the tree where the siblings hid.

At this critical moment, Henry considered fleeing with Helen. He regretted not doing so earlier. Even getting lost in the forest seemed safer than facing the looming danger. But a quick look revealed it was too late. The open space surrounding them would expose any escape attempt to the gorilla. Another tree nearby offered a slim chance, but they risked being seen. They decided to stay put, hoping the ape would pass without noticing them. The ship-carpenter's return startled him, fearing the worst for Henry and Helen. His cry, though unintentional, inadvertently saved them. They emerged from hiding, only to realize they had revealed themselves to the gorilla. The creature, eyes blazing, turned towards them, ready to pounce.|"1. What did Henry consider doing with Helen at that critical moment?

Unfortunately, the young Helen found herself in a perilous situation, defenseless against the approaching ape. Murtagh rushed to her aid, while Henry, attempting to protect his sister, aimed his musket at the ape. However, the old flint musket misfired due to dampness from the tropical forest. Henry resorted to using the gun as a club, but his efforts were futile against the hairy creature. The ape swiftly snatched Helen and began climbing the tree with her. Despite shouts and struggles, the abductor ascended, with Henry clinging briefly before being shaken off. The hunters arrived too late to prevent the ape from taking Helen higher into the treetops. The group felt helpless, unable to use their weapons without risking Helen's life. The situation seemed dire, with the child's fate hanging in the balance as the ape moved to another tree.|"1.

The plan was quickly put into action. Spectators hurried to the side where the gorilla was heading. They watched as it grabbed twigs, pulled branches closer, bridged the gap with its long arm, and leaped from one to the next like a squirrel. Deeper into the dense foliage of the next tree it went, without pause, and then to the next. Henry followed with a musket, but it misfired. Saloo's weapon was ineffective too. The pursuers followed the gorilla through the forest, hoping for a chance to rescue the child. They trusted in a higher power. The pursuit was unusual and uncertain. They couldn't tell if Helen was alive or dead. The chase led them through dark tropical forest canopies, with only shreds of the child's dress guiding them. They could only catch glimpses of the child, her face buried in the gorilla's fur.|"1. What did the spectators witness the gorilla doing as it moved through the trees?

To describe the deep sorrow of her father in this situation would be impossible. The pain he felt was beyond words. Some feelings are too profound for language to convey; emotions that even the most talented artists or poets struggle to capture. Initially, the father's grief was masked by the urgency of the chase. The hope that they could catch up to the ape, the realization that they were stuck at the lagoon's edge, and the sight of the gorilla with his daughter all added to the anguish. The image of his daughter in the clutches of a monstrous creature haunted him. They feared the worst, knowing she was likely gone. The father's mind was consumed with thoughts of her fate and the slim chance of giving her a proper burial. The group, including the Malay, pondered the unusual circumstances. The Malay, familiar with the ape's behavior, could only speculate on the situation.

Maybe the monster didn't harm her. Let's trust in Allah, whom you call God, English people. Maybe he will help us."" These words revived the father's hope. He realized the lagoon was too deep to cross. The strange noises came from the center, possibly from creatures in the trees or on the ground. One voice sounded like a child, but Saloo recognized it as a young orangutan. Captain Redwood felt a glimmer of hope that his daughter might still be alive and could be saved."|"4.

The voices were not far, maybe half a mile away. The captain prepared by securing his essentials and giving his gun to Saloo. They swiftly swam towards the center of the lagoon, guided by the ourangs' calls. Henry and Murtagh watched, unable to swim the distance. As they navigated the dark waters, they listened to the gorillas' chatter. Approaching the gorillas' gathering, they scanned for a foothold among the trees while swimming silently.

As they continued swimming cautiously, suddenly both swimmers stopped simultaneously as if something below had grabbed their legs. They had hit a submerged bank, raising them to a half-standing position. Upon reaching a low-lying islet covered with trees, they spotted a massive banyan tree with a platform-like nest. Among the nest, they saw the gorilla and three hairy human-like creatures, one being the abductor of the child. The mother and the infant were also there, playing around the captive child. The father aimed his rifle, but the Malay suggested using a poison dart for a silent kill. Saloo expertly took aim at the creatures, showing his skill.|"1.

Saloo's advice made Captain Redwood pause and rethink his actions. The Malay quickly picked a target for his poisoned arrow, the same one the captain had aimed at. With a swift puff, the arrow flew towards the gorilla, causing it to feel a sting but not enough to deter it. The poison soon took effect, sending the beast into a deep sleep from which it would never wake. The gorilla's mate succumbed to the poison as well. The rescued girl was unharmed, and a makeshift palanquin was crafted to transport her comfortably. Helen, the captain's daughter, recovered swiftly, her courage bolstered by past trials.
