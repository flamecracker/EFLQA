"""Who is Sir Erskine mentioned in the song?"" asked Mrs. Harmar. ""He's Sir William Erskine, an officer under Sir William Howe,"" answered old Harmar. ""This song brought much joy to the whigs when it was written. Even if the enemy was correct, we had the last laugh on our side."" ""I was going to explain,"" replied his father. ""Mr. David Bushnell invented a variety of clever underwater devices to take out the British ships in the Delaware. One of these was the American torpedo, shaped like a water tortoise, operated by one person. It had enough air for 30 minutes, valves for sinking or rising, ballast for balance, and a seat. It also had a powder magazine with a timer for ignition. A skilled operator could approach a ship undetected, attach the torpedo, and escape before detonation. Despite initial setbacks, Bushnell's inventions caused chaos among the British, leaving them bewildered about the source of the explosions."""|"6.
