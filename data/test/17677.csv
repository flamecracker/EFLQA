Dick left quickly with a message for the captain in charge of guarding the valley entrance. He hurried under the tree cover and crawled the rest of the way to reach the captain safely. Warner was already there, and they were under heavy fire from the slopes. Warner noted that the guerrillas hadn't attempted to breach the gateway since their failed horse attack. The sharpshooters were effective, evident by the fallen guerrillas on the slopes. Despite the defense, Colonel Winchester felt uneasy about being besieged by guerrillas they had come to capture. He grappled with the reversal of roles, now defending instead of attacking. The colonel, disappointed by the losses on both sides, observed the guerrillas' strategic use of cover. He pondered a new plan to fulfill their mission as the battle raged on.|"1. What did Dick do before reaching the captain safely?

He returned to the general's side and witnessed the intense bombardment. Many guns in a wide half circle bombarded the slim Confederate lines with shells. The continuous blaze covered a long front, with huge clouds of smoke above. Harry thought the Union army would attack, but it didn't. Grant held back, avoiding unnecessary sacrifices after remembering Cold Harbor. As night fell, the cannons flashed and thundered, and Lee, with fewer than twenty thousand men, left Petersburg. It pained Harry to leave the city where they had resisted Grant for so long, but it was necessary. They couldn't endure the relentless fire.

It was an old song filled with sadness and longing, but Harry vividly recalled that warm, melodious voice. If he could find Sam Jarvis, he would get the help he needed from the happy valley where Jarvis resided.
