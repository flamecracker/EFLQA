A search was organized with all the boys, Mr. Rover, and Aleck joining in. Despite a thorough search of the steam yacht from front to back, the missing deck hand, Wingate, was nowhere to be found.

Bahama Bill shared a story to pass the time, reminiscing about a circus orangutan's disappearance on a ship years ago.

There was nothing to do but backtrack, and they managed to retrace about half the distance. Suddenly, a beam of light pierced the treetops nearby. They followed it, only to get lost in the jungle. A lantern was accidentally broken, reducing their light. Anderson Rover suggested returning to find his sons, and everyone agreed. The boys were eventually found tied up. Mr. Rover realized the seriousness of the situation. The path led westward, through rough terrain with dense vines and spider webs. As they reached a swamp, they split up to search. Progress was slow and challenging, with water, brushwood, and scratches. Bahama Bill predicted a storm, recalling a hurricane in Cuba.

The news that they were close to the treasure cave boosted the group's spirits, despite the heavy rain. They followed Bahama Bill eagerly, aiming to be the first to see the sought-after spot. The old sailor explained that an earthquake had caused the cave's collapse, leaving a pile of massive rocks blocking the entrance. Anderson Rover and his sons realized that reaching the treasure would be a monumental task, possibly taking weeks or months. After seeking shelter from the rain, they assessed the situation. Bahama Bill believed the treasure lay buried beneath them, but the depth was uncertain. They planned to carefully remove rocks and potentially use dynamite to clear the way. Mr. Rover suggested finding a direct path to the bay for easier access to their steam yacht. Despite the challenges, the group remained determined to uncover the treasure.|"1.

Captain Barforth mentioned that he had a sufficient amount of powder on the ship for cannon salutes and signals. However, if they required dynamite, he would need to go to one of the larger islands to get it. The next day, Mr. Rover and Captain Barforth, accompanied by Dick, Tom, and Sam, went ashore, leaving Asa Carey in charge of the steam yacht. The mate was instructed to stay near the reef's mouth and send armed crew members ashore if a distress signal was given. They landed near a path leading to a sunken cave, equipped with tools for digging, a rock drill, and some powder. Mr. Rover suggested blasting some rocks to explore the cave entrance. Dora overheard a conversation about Walt Wingate's plan to thwart Mr. Rover's treasure hunt, involving the mate and assistant engineer. Songbird took a small boat to find Mr. Rover and Captain Barforth, hearing a gunshot while approaching the shore where the Rover boys were.|"1.
