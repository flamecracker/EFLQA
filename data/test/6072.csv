As we struggled to carry the wounded to safety, another explosion rocked the ship, causing havoc.

Shortly after, the two cruisers on the left side, which initially seemed to be following the Lawrence towards the enemy, returned to their positions, along with the ships guarding the transports on that side. In contrast, the two destroyers abruptly changed course and pursued the Lawrence. Following Lord Hastings' orders, the three cruisers on the right side protecting the transports maintained their formation to prevent potential submarine attacks. A cheer erupted from the Lawrence as a British shell hit one of the enemy submarines, causing it to explode. Despite sinking two U-boats, four enemy submarines remained a threat. The British and American ships faced a challenging battle against the remaining submarines. The Angelic, a British destroyer, bravely engaged one of the submarines, ultimately sinking it with precise shots. The enemy retaliated by launching torpedoes at the Lawrence, one of which struck the ship's engine room, causing casualties among the crew. The British fleet intensified its attack on the enemy submarines, but the relentless foes continued to launch torpedoes. Despite sustaining hits, the Lawrence persevered in the fight.|"1.
