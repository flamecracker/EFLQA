"""It's a long way to Europe,"" he said, ""but news reaches even the deepest woods. I have friends in Spain near the court who keep me informed of any changes."" Henry disliked the condescending smile. Francisco Alvarez's mistake was assuming a superior attitude, a common error made by strong men when faced with others of equal strength.

He envisioned it surpassing London and Paris, offering a vast fertile land in Louisiana. He extended an invitation for Henry and his friends to join him, promising opportunities beyond their wildest dreams.

Alvarez's conviction was evident in his powerful words. He offered Henry a chance to stay in Louisiana and contribute to a great cause. He suggested that Spain could be a valuable ally to the people of Kaintock, separated by mountains, forests, and Indians, in need of a strong friend like the King of Spain."|"1.
