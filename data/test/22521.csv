The circus tent had been dismantled late at night for transportation to another town. Mr. Barlow, the circus owner, cautioned Kit about joining the business due to its temptations. Kit, considering a blacksmith's life distasteful, found solace in the idea of traveling with the circus, where he could enjoy light duties and good pay.
