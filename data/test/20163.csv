The group departed Fossato early on a steamboat bound for Naples. Upon arrival, they hopped on a local train to Vesuvius. Due to limited seating, there was a chaotic rush for seats until Miss Morley, with a discreet tip to the conductor, secured a compartment for the group. They found themselves squeezed among locals and tourists from various countries, including lively Swedes and well-dressed Japanese travelers exploring Europe. The train set off after a flurry of activity, passing through Naples' poorer neighborhoods with colorful yet worn-down houses surrounded by gardens. As the train journeyed on, they traversed vineyards and orchards bursting with almond, peach, and cherry blossoms. The banks of the railway were adorned with vibrant flowers typical of March in Southern Italy. Further along the journey, they marveled at the transition of vegetation from cactuses and olives to chestnut and oak trees, signaling their approach to the volcanic region. Despite the looming presence of Vesuvius, locals continued their daily routines, cultivating the land with resilience. The group then switched to an electric railway at Pugliano for the final ascent up Vesuvius, where they witnessed the stark beauty of the landscape evolving with each passing moment.|"1.

The group was in awe of the impressive surroundings as they ventured towards the crater. The guides, in their gray uniforms with red-banded caps, provided comfort and encouragement. Delia clung to Peachy, Lorna held Irene's arm tightly, and Miss Morley reassured everyone of their safety. As they approached the crater, the mist cleared, revealing a deep rocky ravine with vapors rising like a witch's cauldron. The guides urged them forward to catch a glimpse of the fiery crater. Descending among lava and cinders, they felt the warmth beneath their boots from steam jets. At a ledge of volcanic rock, they marveled at the yellow sulfur top of the cone and a molten lava lake below. The guides even offered souvenirs of sulfur lumps and lava pieces with embedded coins. Despite the challenging climb back, the group made it safely, except for the guides' unexpected demand for excessive tips at the end, leaving the girls feeling indignant but wiser about the customs of Naples.|"1.

"Dear Lorna,

I've finally found the time to write to you after ages! Mother shared the news of your move to Naples and also gave me your school address. I truly hope you are enjoying your time there and have settled in well. I always wished you would come to Brackenfield! Did you know that Joan is here now too? It's her first term, and she is absolutely thrilled. She's showing promise in her studies and sports; she's already making waves in the New Girls' Junior Team. We recently had a successful hockey season, with a memorable victory against ""Hawthornden"" with a score of 4-2 in our favor! It was a significant win as we had never beaten them before. How is hockey at Fossato? Or is tennis the main sport? We had a delightful gymnastic display recently, with Mona and Beatrice showcasing impressive balance-walking and side vaulting. The juniors performed country dances in costume, which always receives applause from parents. Ailsa and I are working hard for an upcoming concert where we have to sing a duet; we're both nervous but hoping for the best.

I am having a wonderful time at Brackenfield this year. Being a prefect is lovely. At first, I was very scared when the headmistress asked me to be a school officer, but thanks to Ailsa, everything has been going smoothly. Ailsa and I have been inseparable since our first term at St. Ethelberta's. I often visit The Tamarisks to cheer up Auntie, who has been feeling lonely since Elaine got married. I still keep in touch with Miss Norton's nephew, Eric, who is now stronger and attending a preparatory school. I am planning to convince my mother to let me invite Eric for part of the summer holidays. In other news, Leonard is in India, Larry is at Cambridge, Peter and Cyril are doing well at St. Bede's, and Nora's baby girl is adorable. Marjorie is currently touring Italy with the Prestons, and she might visit your area. I wish I could have come for Easter to see you and the oranges growing on trees! Perhaps Ailsa will invite me to their country cottage in Cornwall for the holidays.|"1. What is the main reason the speaker is having a wonderful time at Brackenfield this year?

Irene was excited about the upcoming school trip to the Greek temples at P√¶stum. The seniors and Transition students were preparing for this adventure. Miss Morley had arranged a motor char-√†-banc to take about twenty-four girls and teachers on the trip.

However, sitting next to Mrs. Clark, the chaplain's wife, turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The drive to P√¶stum was beautiful, with fields filled with white wild narcissus flowers. Mrs. Clark shared stories about the area's past, including how it used to be a haunt for brigands. The students enjoyed picking flowers and learning about the region's history.|"1.
