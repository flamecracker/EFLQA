Jane McCarthy reported that there was no rope available. Harriet chose to proceed without it, confident in her plan to assess the flood. Enlisting Jane's help, the two girls moved the dining table to the upper deck, leaving it there temporarily. Despite standing in water, Harriet positioned the cots at the doorway's edge, with Jane assisting in holding them steady. Using the table as support, Harriet secured the cots in place. Jane later located a heavy blanket, which they placed over the cots on the upper deck, weighting it down with stones. Unable to access the upper deck or the boat without disrupting the barricade, Harriet waded ashore, enduring waves that knocked her over. The girls then tended to the stove, gathering leaves and grass to prevent rusting. They also dried bedding and clothing, hanging them on bushes. Though the girls were uncomfortable, Harriet and Jane focused on organizing supplies in the cabin and bailing water out of the boat.|"1. What did Jane McCarthy report was unavailable?
