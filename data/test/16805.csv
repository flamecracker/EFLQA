During a period of slow business, Superintendent Bradley reduced everyone's wages, including his own, promising to restore them once business improved. This prevented a strike. After a month, wages were restored, but employees had to work an extra half hour without pay. While a strike was avoided temporarily, the relationship between employer and employees suffered. Discontent grew until Chief Foreman Hugh O'Hara and worker Thomas Hansell met with Mr. Bradley to request fair compensation for the extra work.

We were walking home for dinner, Ned and I lived close to the school, making some kids envious as they carried their lunch in tin pails. It was a September Friday, a soft golden haze covered the hills and quails whistled. I could picture Big Woods in the sunlight. Ned wanted to skip school to gather shellbarks, I hesitated recalling a past punishment. But we gave in, meeting at the orchard after lunch. I grabbed my chestnut club, hidden under my jacket. We trekked to Yellow-breeches, a mile away. The nuts were abundant, we filled Ned's bag. I hit a tree with my club, dislodging it into the creek. I climbed to retrieve it, but a wild-cat appeared, causing me to fall into the water. Ned, unable to swim, ran for help. The wild-cat emerged, glaring at me fiercely.|"1.

In a perilous situation, I found myself drifting down a creek, facing a menacing wild-cat inching closer. As the branch I clung to sank, the beast advanced, ready to attack.

Science has not yet understood the laws governing cyclones. These intense storms are thought to result from highly charged electric conditions in the atmosphere. Cyclones, previously seen mainly in the Pacific and Indian oceans, are the most destructive storms, surpassing monsoons and tornadoes. Navigators caught in a cyclone can escape by sailing perpendicular to the wind, moving beyond the storm's outer edge or reaching its calm center. Ocean cyclones range from fifty to a thousand miles in diameter. Professor Douglas from Ann Arbor University creates miniature cyclones using a copper plate charged with electricity and arsenious acid gas. Cyclones, also known as hurricanes, typhoons, or tornadoes, are caused by conflicting wind currents. They carry winds up to 140 miles per hour and can cause immense destruction. Cyclones never touch the equator and are marked by their terrifying force and concentrated power within a small area.|"1. What are cyclones thought to result from according to the text?

The local tornado, like a cyclone, is a revolving force with unique phenomena. Each tornado behaves differently, sometimes causing terrible disasters and other times just heavy thunder showers. Tornadoes can be unpredictable, leaving destruction in one area but sparing others. They can level forests in straight lines or create pockets of damage off track. Tornadoes can act like enormous scoops, carrying objects for miles or dumping them abruptly. Settlers in tornado-prone areas build deep cellars for refuge. However, tornadoes can still be deadly, lifting roofs and causing tragic accidents. Some tornadoes show strong electrical activity, magnetizing metal objects and even stopping clocks. The force of tornadoes can be seen in the speed at which objects are thrown, piercing trees like spears.|"1. What is a unique characteristic of tornadoes mentioned in the passage?

Tornadoes can cause significant changes in the landscape by scooping up water or objects and depositing them elsewhere. In one instance, a large pond's water was lifted and dropped on a hill, creating gullies. In another, a tornado diverted a river's course towards a lake. Stories abound of objects being carried away and left in unexpected places, like the accordion found entangled in a tree. Despite their power, tornadoes offer a chance of escape and are short-lived. In contrast, blizzards can be relentless and isolating, as experienced by a man caught in a snowstorm in Kansas. Loneliness and uncertainty loom large in the face of nature's fury, highlighting the need for preparation and companionship in challenging times.|"1.

Tornadoes can cause significant changes in the landscape by scooping up water or objects and depositing them elsewhere. In one instance, a large pond's water was lifted and dropped on a hill, creating gullies. In another, a tornado diverted a river's course towards a lake. Stories abound of objects being carried away and left in unexpected places, like the accordion found entangled in a tree. Despite their power, tornadoes offer a chance of escape and are short-lived. In contrast, blizzards can be relentless and isolating, as experienced by a man caught in a snowstorm in Kansas. Loneliness and uncertainty loom large in the face of nature's fury, highlighting the need for preparation and companionship in challenging times.|"4. What lesson is emphasized by the passage regarding facing nature's fury?
A) The importance of running away

"""The key to success in lassoing,"" explained Mr. Ohnimus, ""is having a top-notch riata. A riata must be perfectly stretched, oiled, and in excellent condition for accurate work. Here's how a good riata is crafted: rawhide is cut into thin strips, half tanned with the hair on, soaked, and braided tightly. The finished riata is buried in sand for a week or more to retain moisture. Burying the riata is crucial; soaking in water won't do. Vaqueros bury and stretch their riata every six to eight months. The riata is never tied to the saddle but hangs ready for use. A vaquero must be able to release the rope instantly in case of danger, like a bull pulling with force. When a vaquero spots his target, he grabs the riata, usually with his left hand, to prepare for a throw. Being ambidextrous is an advantage in this trade, allowing for quick throws from any position.

Representing the cowboy, I hold the remaining coils in my hand, adjusting my forefinger for better control. The next step is enlarging the noose, crucial for roping a steer from a distance. By swinging the noose until it reaches the desired size through centrifugal force, the lasso hand must maintain a loose grip. Then, keeping the noose open without entangling it requires skill. A precise twist of the wrist and judgment to avoid obstacles are vital. Successfully circling the noose overhead, the key is to release it at the right moment. Throwing the riata accurately demands practice. Timing the cast and aiming at a specific point are essential. Gauging distances and releasing the correct number of coils are critical. After roping the steer, securing the rope around the saddle horn swiftly is crucial to prevent being pulled off the horse. Using a secure hitch method ensures safety.|"1.

The journalist positioned himself twenty feet behind Mr. Ohnimus, completely hidden from view. Ohnimus skillfully swung the loop over his head and without looking back, flung it behind him. The loop encircled the newspaper man perfectly, and with a swift pull, Ohnimus had his arms tightly bound to his sides. This technique, known as a backthrow, has been favored by Mexican bandits for its surprise factor. The lasso can swiftly immobilize a target from behind, as demonstrated by Ohnimus. The reporter, now captured by the rope, learned firsthand about the defensive capabilities of the lasso. Ohnimus shared his experiences using the lasso to catch sea lions and hogs, highlighting its effectiveness as a tool for control and defense.
