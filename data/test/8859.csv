The upper classes of Canadians were largely loyal to the English connection. They were descendants of old French families and opposed popular insurrection. When Captain Wilson and his party reached Montreal, they found the situation not as dire as feared. Upper Canada and Quebec might be at risk, but without local support, American success would be short-lived. With spring, re-enforcements from England would arrive, putting the invaders at a disadvantage. The Indians of the Five Nations offered to help defend Canada, but General Carleton refused to allow them to cross the frontier due to the horrors of such warfare. Scouts were sent to watch the enemy near Lake Champlain. Jake's laughter angered the scout, Peter, who demanded his silence. The group was joined by two Seneca warriors, familiar to Peter and Ephraim, who had been scouting the north shore of Lake Champlain. They had not encountered the enemy but were aware of the colonists' attempts to sway the locals and recruit Indian tribes.|"1.

The group of boats had already passed the place where the canoe would have crossed if she went straight across the lake when first spotted. The large group of boats continued on as if they weren't aware of the lone canoe behind them. Despite this, the Seneca knew that they were being watched closely. The canoe had eluded the Indians the day before, denting their pride. Although the Seneca had driven them off the lake and they had no reason to suspect a new canoe, he knew they would remain vigilant. The Seneca's eyes never left the boats as Peter and Harold scanned the lake, about ten miles wide. The canoe was four miles from the eastern side, with the boats a mile further up and closer to the western shore. Several canoes were breaking off from the group, heading directly for the shore. The canoe could have easily reached the eastern side before being intercepted, but they risked encountering the Chippewas there. It was crucial to land near the Canadian end to warn St. John's in time. Peter quickly assessed the situation, realizing they could just make it to the opposite shore before the hostile canoes cut them off. The tense race continued, with the canoes nearing each other rapidly. The Indians were gradually turning to intercept the canoe. After twenty minutes of intense paddling, the boats were within a quarter mile of each other, heading towards a close encounter near the shore. The Indians were close together and the race was neck and neck. As|"1. What was the reason the Seneca knew they were being watched closely?

The news of the Americans' actions spurred them on to further efforts. General Washington bolstered his forces and seized control of Dorchester Heights, overlooking Boston. A fierce cannon battle ensued, with the Americans having the upper hand due to their strategic position. Although General Howe considered storming the heights, the heavy losses at Bunker's Hill made him think twice. His inaction over the past months had already cost England the colonies. With 8000 troops at his disposal, Howe could have easily defeated Washington's forces. Instead, he kept his troops confined in the city, failing to secure key positions.

On the 18th of a particular month, Lord Howe led a significant group to the Jersey coast with Lord Cornwallis, who then advanced to Fort Lee and took it by surprise. A deserter had warned the enemy of their approach, causing the garrison to flee chaotically, abandoning their tents, supplies, and military equipment. Lord Cornwallis aggressively pressed on, forcing the Americans out of New Jersey. Another expedition captured Rhode Island. As the cold weather arrived, the British settled into winter quarters. Despite their complete success, the inactivity of their general neutralized their gains. General Howe's failure to pursue Washington's army allowed the colonists to regroup for the next campaign.

The news spread quickly about the English march. The enemy gathered under General Arnold at Ridgefield, where they set up defenses. The English, tired from the long march, boldly attacked the enemy's defenses and pushed through. As they rested for the night, the Americans kept coming, firing from houses and stone walls. General Wooster brought artillery to aid the Americans. Despite exhaustion, the British pushed forward until they were stopped by two strong enemy groups. Brigadier General Erskine led a successful attack, allowing the British to reach their destination. Many skirmishes occurred with varied outcomes. In another daring move, Colonel Meigs destroyed enemy stores at Sag Harbor. General Howe hesitated to attack Washington's camp at Middlebrook. After a retreat, he defeated part of Washington's troops. Washington retreated to the mountains, and Howe withdrew to Staten Island. Colonel Barton captured General Prescott to exchange for General Lee. Howe's missed opportunities allowed the Americans to fortify positions.

On September 13, General Burgoyne crossed the Hudson River and set up camp at Saratoga after collecting provisions. His progress was hindered by the heavy artillery he brought along. In open areas, artillery is useful, but in wooded terrains, it slows down the army. If Burgoyne had moved swiftly after capturing Ticonderoga without the artillery, he could have reached New York easily. But the delay allowed the Americans to gather forces. On the 19th, General Arnold led an attack on the British right, resulting in a fierce battle with no clear winner. After the battle, the Indians left Burgoyne. With dwindling supplies and surrounded by a strong enemy, Burgoyne struggled to move. Attempts to dislodge the Americans failed, leading to a retreat to Saratoga. Burgoyne's army was now reduced to 5,000 men, with limited provisions and no clear escape route.|"1. What hindered General Burgoyne's progress after crossing the Hudson River?

The army under General Burgoyne faced a dire situation, leading to negotiations for surrender. After two days of talks, the agreement was made for the army to lay down its arms and head to Boston to sail back to England. The Canadians were permitted to return home immediately.

""The others are likely at the ruins,"" Peter indicated. ""Three were killed in the fields, suggesting a simultaneous attack on the house. The body by the water was shot from behind while fleeing, indicating the presence of attackers near the house."" The Seneca then directed Peter's attention towards the farm where a tall hunter in deerskin attire approached. ""Glad to see you, old friend,"" the hunter greeted. ""I've been in the woods, puzzled by the Indians searching the clearing. I saw them with two white men and decided to reveal myself."" Pearson expressed his resolve to rescue Nelly Welch, suspected to be in danger. Peter shared his experiences and plans, while Harold observed the impending storm over the lake."|"6.

Two canoes were taken out of the water, emptied, and turned upside down to create a shelter using charred planks from the outhouses. A fire was started, and a meal was cooked as snow began to fall. After eating, the hunters discussed their plans, with the Seneca chief offering occasional input. The group trusted their chief to lead, while Harold and Cameron knew the frontiersmen needed no guidance. Jake, uncomfortable in the cold, stayed close to the fire. Peter and Jack Pearson suspected the attack on the settlements was linked to a previous conflict with a band of Indians dissatisfied with a past campaign. They strategized to locate the chief responsible, find his village, and potentially rescue the abducted girls. The heavy snowfall posed a challenge, making the mission difficult but urgent.|"1.

The hunter explained to Harold that having multiple canoes is advantageous for their safety. They strategically placed the canoes at different points to increase their chances of escape in case they were pursued. Despite the challenges they faced, like stormy weather, they managed to wait it out by the lake and hunted for food. The group also made snowshoes for each member, crucial for walking in the woods. Despite some comical mishaps with the snowshoes, they practiced diligently. They eventually reached their planned spot near Lakes Huron and Michigan, where they hid the canoes. Dividing into smaller groups, they navigated through the woods to a central campsite, well-hidden from view, where they set up a low tent made of deer hides to shelter them during their stay.|"1.

It was small, about twenty to thirty yards across and twice as long, rising steeply from the water to a height of ten to fifteen feet. Covered in rough ground, trees, and brushwood, the party quickly set up camp on the island.

The group quickly discovered that they could rely on fishing to provide them with food. As soon as they dropped their lines, they caught fish. Harold and the men caught trout weighing between three to six pounds, while Nelly needed help from Pearson to reel in a massive fish over twenty pounds. Within an hour of fishing, they had enough food for a week. The fish froze solid quickly after being caught, allowing them to store them for later. The group sought refuge from the intense cold in their huts. The Indians, instead of sneaking up, charged across the ice towards the island. The defenders wasted no time and opened fire, causing casualties among the attackers. The Indians, realizing the futility of shooting at sheltered men, rushed towards the island for close combat. Despite a fierce battle, the defenders repelled the Indian attack, forcing them to retreat. Peter and Harold believed the worst was over, and the danger had passed.|"1.

The leader instructed me to take the belt, but I refused, fearing it would be like carrying my death sentence to the first enemies I encountered. Major Gladwin, in charge of Detroit, recognized me, so I didn't need proof. Shortly after the Miamis departed, Jack and I headed for Detroit, using a hidden canoe. The next day, we saw a fleet of canoes on the lake, but we chose not to race them to avoid conflict. We joined the Wyandots, who were headed to Detroit. Although not explicitly stated, we knew we were captives. The following day, they landed, hid their canoes, and continued on foot. We mimicked their actions until we were near Detroit, where we paused. The chief informed us we were to stay with them for a gathering in Detroit. Although uneasy, we pretended contentment. The situation was precarious with the Wyandots preparing for an attack on Detroit, and we, aware of the danger, were captives among them. The plan moving forward remained uncertain.|"1.

It was a tense moment, young one. We knew escaping without raising an alarm would be difficult. The wigwam was near the river, so we had to cross the clearing to reach the woods. Our chances weren't great, but we had to try. We had moved around often to avoid the attention of the Indians. Quickly slipping out of our cords, we waited for the sentry to turn away. Then, we subdued him silently. We had to act fast. We took the sentry's rifle and fled towards the river. With no shots fired, we reached a canoe. Pushing it into the water, we swam downstream under the bank, using bushes for cover. The Indians mistook the empty canoe for us and paddled to it. We escaped to the trees, leaving them behind.|"1.

Our plan was to find a dense area of bushes. It was much darker under the trees than in the open, but not dark enough to conceal us from the Native American scouts. We ran straight, knowing they could spot us, and after about four hundred yards, we reached a spot with thick undergrowth. Here, we started to evade them, zigzagging through the bushes, staying low. They had lost sight of us, but with so many of them, it seemed impossible to get through. Some tried to track us, but most ran ahead, surrounding us with their shouts. So, we decided to head back to the clearing, staying low and avoiding moonlit patches on the ground. Luckily, it was a camp of warriors, not women or children, so they had all gone after us, leaving the clearing empty. We quickly moved down to the water, found a canoe, crossed the river, and reached the safety of the trees on the other side. We followed the tree line until we neared Fort Detroit. We observed many campfires in front of it, suspecting a large group of Native Americans pretending to be friendly. We circled around them and safely made it to the fort gate. Initially denied entry, we were recognized by a sergeant who remembered us from scouting in the summer. Relieved, we waited until morning to inform the major about Pontiac's alliance against us. Detroit was merely a trading post, defended by a weak stockade and a small garrison|"1. What was the initial plan of the characters?
A. To confront the Native American scouts

Harold was excited that their captivity would soon end, but he knew it would be risky. The backwoodsmen believed the Indians would surround the island when the snow fell. The scouts planned for the Senecas to go first to silence any Indians they encountered. The wind was strong, making it hard to cross the lake even with a canoe. The storm began, and the wind blew fiercely, driving snow into their faces. The lookout saw Indians approaching from both sides. They set up mines in case of an attack. Harold and Cameron joined the girls in their hut, finding warmth despite the storm outside. When Harold stepped out later, he was shocked to see a huge bank of ice crashing against the rocks. Peter arrived, having seen the same, and they hurried back to the hut.|"1. What did Harold and the backwoodsmen believe the Indians would do when the snow fell?

Harold quickly confirmed Peter's observations as he crossed the island. A wide expanse of dark water extended into the distance, pushed by the wind. The entire ice sheet was shifting with the wind, forcing ice to pile up on the island's windward side while the lee side remained clear. Time was of the essence. The canoe was swiftly prepared, stores loaded, and everyone settled in. The men, wrapped in skins and blankets, took their places with the four Indians paddling. Despite the urgency, they had to keep a distance from the island due to falling ice blocks. Harold marveled at the danger they faced.
