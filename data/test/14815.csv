"**Getting a Coal Stove**

Until last Saturday, we didn't have a coal stove at home. We usually burned pine slabs and pieces of our neighbor's fence. They burned well, but the fence got all burned up, and the neighbor refused to rebuild it. So, we went to Jones' and got a coal stove.

After supper, we rubbed our hands warm with a piece of ice and ventured into the room with the new stove. Determined to make it burn, we adjusted every movable dingus that seemed related to the draft. Soon, the stove began emitting intense heat. Within minutes, the room turned hotter than a Turkish bath, causing snow to melt outside, and people in the neighborhood started wearing lighter clothes. Despite our efforts, we couldn't regulate the stove's heat, leaving us in a sweltering situation."|"1. **Question:** How did the family initially heat their home before getting a coal stove?
- A) Burning coal
- B) Burning pine slabs and pieces of a fence
- C) Using an electric heater
- D) Using a gas stove
- E) Using a fireplace"|** B) Burning pine slabs and pieces of a fence|Yes

The man collecting ashes asked Pa if he had lost something, and Pa joked that he was just ""sugaring off."" After recovering, Pa wanted whisky to get rid of the taste, so I gave him some with alum. It made his mouth pucker so much he couldn't speak. I plan to take my customers elsewhere to teach the pharmacist a lesson. My girl who ditched me for a messenger boy got pranked too. I put a terrible-smelling substance on her, and she left with the boy but came back smelling terrible. Her folks noticed, and she had to clean up. Her brother found out and hit me with a fish. I know how to fix a black eye, though. I'm done with the drugstore and might try being a cash boy. Pa's been acting up, but I have a plan to get him back on track."|"6.

A dog with thin legs and big feet wanders the streets, following people of all ages. He's not picky, tail coiled and seemingly indifferent to humans.

"Sometimes it appears that colored performers should have someone to guide them. For instance, a colored concert group may have great voices but lack the knowledge to make the most of their opportunities. Audiences come to hear them because they are colored and expect traditional Negro songs. However, these performers attempt Italian opera and high-class music they are not suited for. They sing these pieces, and the audience loses interest. Towards the end, when they sing a Negro song, the audience goes wild. These performers fail to create a suitable program that matches their abilities and audience expectations. They overreach and cannot find their place. It's like watching a colored girl struggle with an opera piece, howling, screeching, and gasping for breath. The audience does not cheer, but if she sang a simple Negro spiritual, they would have cheered enthusiastically. In another instance, a sickly looking colored man attempted a violin solo, playing a complex piece poorly. If he had played a simple tune like ""The Devil's Dream,"" the audience would have cheered him on. These examples show the challenges faced by colored performers in finding the right balance between their abilities and audience expectations."|"1.

"The deacon was shocked when the little sister asked about ""keno"" after a scandalous incident. The churchgoers looked sadly at her while others snickered. She felt embarrassed and quickly retreated, realizing she shouldn't take advice from strangers. There was surprise over a canned goods dealer in Boston failing. Canning should be profitable, but they wait until produce is unsellable, then charge high prices. Canned peas and peaches are often old and tasteless. A can opener for hard canned peaches could make a fortune. Canning pumpkin and Boston baked beans might have led to the business's failure. The registry law's amendment suggestion involves punching voters' ears after voting to prevent fraud.

We do not intend to start any changes in religious matters, but we understand how challenging it must be for preachers to talk about hell without tangible proof. Currently, they rely on imagination to describe endless punishment, which some people view as mere fiction. They desire something concrete to base their beliefs on. Ministers strive to depict a lake of fire and brimstone to scare sinners, but it might be easier if they could point to the sun on a hot August day and warn sinners of blistering heat unless they repent. If heaven were represented by the moon and hell by the sun, with the moon being a celestial paradise only for the good, many would choose the moon over the scorching sun. This idea is worth exploring.|"1. What is the main concern expressed in the text passage?

There was a humorous incident involving an Advent preacher mistaking a balloonist for the second coming of Christ.

A kind-hearted man praying in a wide-brimmed fishing hat, talks about fishing while red angle worms crawl out of his pocket. The good brothers discuss places for missionary work and even go fishing where the fish are said to be waiting. Mixing religion with fishing can be good for both.

It's also advised not to read political articles that are actually advertisements.

It was quite an adventure when Pa decided we needed to have breakfast earlier than usual. I woke up in terrible pain one night after eating pickled oysters. Unable to sleep, I roused the hired girls to prepare breakfast. Pa and Ma were surprised at the early hour but agreed it felt good to start the day early.

The groceryman suggested giving away rotten eggs, leading to a humorous sign hung outside the store. Despite a rainy day, we embarked on a woodcock hunting excursion.

Woodcocks are highly valued in the market compared to other birds. Many people who have never witnessed them consuming snakes actually enjoy eating them. When they take flight, they make Bohemian sounds and hide behind bushes. Shooting at the bush where they are concealed gives a sense of accomplishment if one is hit. However, it can be exhausting. Walking miles in the woods with mosquitoes buzzing around, anticipating the sight of a woodcock, can be tiring. Despite the fatigue, the experience is exhilarating. It taught us a valuable lesson – it's more convenient and cost-effective to purchase a woodcock rather than hunting for it. Last Wednesday, our telephone rang loudly at 8 o'clock in the morning, leading to a series of amusing and confusing conversations due to crossed wires.|"1.

The heading that seems most fitting for discussion is the artificial propagation of fish. This topic has captured the interest of many brilliant individuals in the country. The outcomes of the experiments have been so promising that it's almost certain that in the next ten centuries, every person, no matter how financially constrained, could pluck bull-heads from crab apple vines and harvest fresh shad from sweet potato trees for less than fifty cents per pound. The successful fish seed planting in Lake Mendota in our state supports a future in the fish business. The low cost and high returns are evident. The initial six quarts of fish seeds sown in the lake have now burgeoned into a staggering 11,000,000 carloads of nutritious food. This development could revolutionize fishing trips if you moisten your bait before casting your line.|"1. What is the main topic of the text passage?

Why not consider raising elephants as a profitable venture? A single elephant can be sold for $8,000, and by pooling resources, a community of farmers can purchase a pair to start their own elephant farm. In a few years, each farm could have its own menagerie, generating between $8,000 to $24,000 annually from surplus elephant sales. While elephants eat a lot, they can be let out to browse and fend for themselves. This elephant farming idea is financially sound, and with proper calculations, one could see a significant profit. In another incident, a justice of the peace in Menasha wanted to confront an editor, but the situation was resolved amicably. Meanwhile, during a church meeting, members discussed funding pulpit furniture and debated the merits of raw versus stewed oysters for a sociable event. A humorous anecdote about a deacon and a rogue oyster added a light touch to the conversation.|"1. What is the main idea of the passage?

The issue at hand is what Anna Dickinson will do with Fanny's wardrobe. Even though Anna may believe Fanny's talent is tied to the clothes, a thorough search might reveal that Fanny has hidden her talent elsewhere. Anna, being much smaller than Fanny, cannot wear her wardrobe on stage. If she did, the boys might pelt her with cotton batting. Fanny's attire, accustomed to her talent, would need stuffing to fit Anna. In fact, there would be enough room in Fanny's dress to hold a feather bed, cotton batting, birdseed, air cushions, towels, bird cages, papers, bran, and hay, all in different areas. The people prefer seeing Fanny without her wardrobe rather than seeing Dickinson in it. Men are often gallant towards women in distress, like helping a lady fix her attire discreetly.
