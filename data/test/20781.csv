"When all was settled, they descended, the uncle carrying Clara, who couldn't have managed the long walk. On the way down, Heidi shared with the old lady about her friends in the hut, their struggles with cold winters and scarce food. Brigida was hanging up Peter's shirt when they all arrived. Rushing inside, she told her mother, ""They're all leaving. Uncle is taking the lame child."" Overhearing, the grandmama intervened kindly, assuring Heidi would stay to bring joy. Mrs. Sesemann promised annual visits to the Alm. The grandmother, deeply moved, felt blessed by the kindness shown. Clara tearfully bid farewell the next day, comforted by Heidi's plans for the upcoming summer.
