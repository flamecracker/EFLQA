Miss Miranda Sawyer's traditional garden was the most delightful spot in Riverboro on a bright July morning. The vibrant color of the brick house shone through the shade of the elms and maples. Lush hop-vines climbed up the lightning rods and water spouts, draping delicate clusters here and there. Woodbine adorned the old shed and tool house, turning them into beautiful structures, while the flower beds were the loveliest and most aromatic in the entire region. A row of dahlias encircled the garden, with scarlet, gold, and variegated blooms. Pansies smiled from a round plot in the center, surrounded by sweet phlox in the corners. Portulaca and nasturtiums filled the spaces, and spirea, gillyflowers, mignonette, marigolds, and clove pinks thrived in the shell-bordered beds. A grove of sweet clover behind the barn attracted bees with its white feathery tips, while aromatic mint and thyme soaked up the sun, releasing a warm and delightful scent into the summer air. Little Rebecca Randall, weeding the bed, was inspired by the garden's beauty to create poetry and compositions in her thought book, in line with her passion for words and rhythm.|"1.

Rebecca sadly said goodbye, her inspiring plan shattered like a bubble. She decided to focus on overcasting, dreading it the most. She felt they were not cut out to be home missionaries.

Climbing the ladder, she felt a sense of escape. The view from the hilltop was breathtaking, with Alice Robinson's barn in sight.

"Rebecca was a natural writer, effortlessly putting her thoughts to paper. Despite her unconventional handwriting, lacking the structured Spencerian style, she found solace and ease in writing from a young age. Spelling came naturally to her, guided more by her ear and visual memory than formal instruction. Her intentions to consult a dictionary before transcribing her thoughts were often forgotten in moments of creative brilliance. Sitting in the barn's open door, Rebecca's imagination soared beyond her family's farm life in Riverboro. In contrast to the strict rules of the Brick House, Rebecca's spirit sought freedom in the sunlight. Her diary, titled ""Thought Book,"" was her sanctuary, where her unique and lively thoughts found expression. Through her writings, Rebecca hoped to inspire future generations, believing that her inherited genius would captivate the world."|"1. What was Rebecca's handwriting style like?

When Emma Jane and I visited the beach with Uncle Jerry Cobb, we ran along the wet sand, observing the imprints our boots left behind. Emma Jane's foot turned slightly inward, which the boys rudely call splayfoot. Seth Strout had recently repaired one of my shoes, and the sand bore the evidence of his patchwork. While memorizing The Psalm of Life for a Friday speech, I pondered leaving a patched footprint like the repaired shoe or having Emma Jane's crooked impression on the sands of time. I shared my plan with Aunt Jane to start my Reminiscences, despite her view that I was too young. I argued that each person is unique, and if I were to suddenly pass away, who else would record my memories? Aunt Miranda dismissed the idea, suggesting the sun and moon would continue their cycles regardless. However, I believe that each individual's memories are valuable and should be preserved.|"1.

"We unearthed our rose cakes too early, expecting their sweetness to be a delight. Little did we know they were not ready after days of autumn sun and wind. Why did we unearth them prematurely?

Punishment is complex, and I've learned that self-punishment isn't always effective. I once threw my pink parasol down a well as penance, but it got stuck, requiring help to retrieve it.

Next week, I plan to experiment with rewarding myself to see its impact on my character before writing my composition. It's challenging to find self-rewards, so I might seek help from Aunt Jane and friends for ideas.

Aunt Miranda might disapprove, but if these rewards prove beneficial, my life would be filled with joy. Alice Robinson couldn't play as she broke her mother's blue platter and was being punished.

However, we feel that the Lord, who has been overseeing since B.C., is a better judge of punishment than us, who only learned about it in 1492 A.D.

In my room, it's too chilly to write now that we've switched to an air-tight stove in the dining area. I used to have my thoughts flow freely by the open fire, but now, with Aunt Miranda and Aunt Jane close by, I hesitate to put my secret musings on paper. It's curious how swiftly people can change in a few months. Emma Jane's cat had kittens the same day I got this book, and Mrs. Perkins kept the prettiest one, drowning the rest. It's a relief they don't treat children the same way. I'm glad to have learned so much in the past months, even though my thoughts in this book seem childish now. Emma Jane's cat has grown wise with age, just like me. Emma Jane's new winter dress was exquisite, but my modest attire suits me fine. Aunt Miranda is considering blackening the quills on my hat to freshen it up, showing how practical and frugal she is.|"1. What is the speaker's main concern in the passage?

In my room, it's too chilly to write now that we've switched to an air-tight stove in the dining area. I used to have my thoughts flow freely by the open fire, but now, with Aunt Miranda and Aunt Jane close by, I hesitate to put my secret musings on paper. It's curious how swiftly people can change in a few months. Emma Jane's cat had kittens the same day I got this book, and Mrs. Perkins kept the prettiest one, drowning the rest. It's a relief they don't treat children the same way. I'm glad to have learned so much in the past months, even though my thoughts in this book seem childish now. Emma Jane's cat has grown wise with age, just like me. Emma Jane's new winter dress was exquisite, but my modest attire suits me fine. Aunt Miranda is considering blackening the quills on my hat to freshen it up, showing how practical and frugal she is.|"2.

"Dear Mr. Simpson,

I understand that times have been tough for you, especially with a large family to care for on the farm. It seems like you should have given Mrs. Simpson a wedding ring when you first got married, as they are symbols of lasting love.

I hope it brings her comfort, especially now that she's unwell. I remember how a simple ring helped me during a difficult time, and I hope this gift does the same for Mrs. Simpson. Please don't be upset with me; I care for you and wish you both happiness.
