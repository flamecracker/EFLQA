"Once upon a time, Ananzi had a clever plan. He bought a lot of fat, sacks, and string, along with a big frying pan. He blew a shell to summon the Head-fish, named ""Green Eel,"" from the sea. Ananzi told the fish that the King wanted all the fish to come ashore for a new life. ""Green Eel"" agreed and called the fish. Ananzi started a fire, fried the fish, and everything went well until he reached the slippery Head-fish, who escaped back into the water. Ananzi suspected the Lion was following him, so he pretended to eat fish and tied the Lion up when he caught up. However, the Lion tricked Ananzi and got free, chasing him until Ananzi transformed into an old man to escape."|"6. What did Ananzi buy as part of his plan?
