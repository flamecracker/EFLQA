But those granite flakes at Mabgwe were easy for a primitive people to manage - a very primitive people. Very primitive, or why did they build on sand when, six inches deeper, they might have founded on bed-rock? They didn't understand arches, seemingly. They weren't very careful about bond in building, were they? Nor were they very careful to break joint outside, much less inside, so far as I can judge. And the script; where is it? And the graves; where are they? If they were Semites, why didn't they write? If they were Semites, why didn't they bury? . . . But it isn't as easy as it looks, the riddle.

The next day, I made three mistakes. I skipped a meeting; I missed the True Romance Pageant performance; and I overlooked the St. Uriel's Native Church bazaar at the Pageant grounds. St. Uriel's church was constructed by European builders, described as a very educational building by the Pageant-Master. As we journeyed towards the hills, we finally reached a massive circular stone structure with a dome. Spenser noted that it resembled a stone cattle shed and a Kaffir hut, not built in the traditional Mabgwe style. Despite some European involvement, the construction was primarily done by Africans. The work had faced setbacks due to rains and the departure of the European overseer. However, a skilled African craftsman had taken charge, rebuilding the damaged parts slowly but steadily. The ongoing construction was seen as both an artistic and religious endeavor, symbolizing the growing Christian faith in the region.|"1. What were the three mistakes made by the speaker the next day?

It was a one-sided battle, with no response from the enemy. My colleague remarked on the gun's power, while I prayed for those facing it on the hill. Moments passed slowly as the ship maneuvered. The gun fired again, targeting a crowd of askaris on the hill. I observed the gun-layer as he adjusted the weapon, while my sandbag friend moved among the crew, taking charge after the official gun-layer.

A local person who had traveled from the northern town brought me a handwritten message from Johannes: 'Dear father, please come to us. Hurry with your horse. The white man is not turning back. He has finished his food and is heading to the hills, claiming he is mad. Please pray for us! Johannes.' I immediately went to see Mrs. Browne. I found her sitting under a vibrant hibiscus bush, looking pale against its bright colors. I informed her that her husband wanted to extend his journey. She burst into tears, unable to comprehend it. I then mentioned my plan to go after him the next morning to expedite his return. This lifted her spirits, and she began preparing what I should bring. Drayton, whom I showed Johannes' note to after dinner, reacted seriously. 'Don't worry,' I reassured him. 'It just means he's run out of our supplies. He can buy local food like monkey-nuts, sweet potatoes, or rice in the villages. He might have developed a taste for native cuisine and snuff. He will manage.' The next morning, we set off early, even though Drayton was still in bed when I returned from church. We departed at eight, relieved to find that we had good horses. We took comfort in the memory of Browne's|"6. What did the speaker and Drayton find comforting before setting off early the next morning?

As we journeyed, we inquired at local homes and eventually picked up a fresh trail in the afternoon. A white traveler on a speckled mule had passed by in the morning, accompanied by a boy carrying blankets. We then took a break to rest our ponies. As darkness approached, we sought refuge in a nearby village. Unfortunately, there was no talk of the white traveler's passing that day. The villagers kindly offered us beans, monkey-nuts for dinner, and mealies for our ponies. After our meal, we relaxed on a rush mat and contemplated the mysterious traveler. The villagers provided us with an old hut, which we later exchanged for a spot under a rocky hill where we spent the night peacefully. The next day, we continued our search for clues, riding through the challenging hill terrain. Despite our efforts, we found no leads and settled for the night in a desolate garden, building a fire and sharing a quiet meal before retiring under the starlit sky.|"1.

More than two years ago, I had to leave my country parish due to illness and embark on a journey to the south. After spending time in the Mediterranean, I traveled to the eastern coast of Africa. Reluctantly leaving Zanzibar behind, I ventured into the rugged terrain of the central tableland, planning to eventually head to Cape Town by rail. During Easter week, I found myself lost while camping overnight. Waking up disoriented, I realized I had missed my intended destination, a mission station, the previous night. With no nearby village or passers-by, I decided to rest until dawn. As the sun rose in the heavy April dew, baboons barked from a nearby hill. Observing a mist rising from a stream and native trees, I spotted a figure approaching down a path—it was Leonard Reeve, the man I had been seeking. He greeted me warmly, and even though we had run out of food, he assured me that we could manage. I instructed my carrier to gather provisions while we were away.|"1.

I walked alongside my small, damp friend through the dew-covered grass on a chilly day. We attended a lovely service in a unique church made of wattle, earth, and grass on a hilltop. The church overlooked village gardens and wooded uplands. Although I couldn't understand all the words, the service was beautiful. Afterward, we visited the home of a native teacher, where we were warmly welcomed. We shared tea and conversation, reminiscing about past times. The teacher's enthusiasm for his homeland was evident, and we enjoyed discussing the differences between his previous life in a busy city and his current peaceful surroundings in the African moorland. Later, he showed me his church, which, though well-kept, lacked the charm of the simpler decorations I had admired at his teacher's altar.|"1. What type of church did the speaker visit?

Contemplating Leonard's situation, I resolved to offer help by taking on his responsibilities, allowing him to return to his urban life with Cecilia.

I almost completely forgot about him for the next four days. The days were filled with excitement - meeting people at headquarters, sending business messages, writing letters in a hurry, and guiding a small native and his dog to the coast. Finally, I arrived and eagerly discussed shipping updates. Initially, my chances of leaving quickly seemed dim, but then a new idea struck me. Since there were no ships to my intended African destination, why not book a passage to an unknown port? I heard there were transports going beyond. Despite financial constraints and three of us needing fares, solutions started emerging. I decided to embark on this uncharted journey promptly and informed my friends, including the one in the hospital. As I walked towards the dock, thoughts of him faded for a few more days.|"1.

The following night, I traveled in third class from Johannesburg without missing my train connection. I had the carriage to myself, though a native was cleared out by the guard. As the train neared Mafeking, I woke to find a presence on the other side of the carriage, though only my bag was visible. The next night, nearing Bulawayo, I had a Jewish traveling companion who left at Francistown. Excited to be nearing my country, I struggled to sleep. An old acquaintance, a detective, joined me, unaware of the presence in the seat beside me. After explaining, he looked suspicious.

I stayed on an island with an Intelligence Officer recently. The island was lush and green, but it had some flaws. Most of the Germans who lived there were now prisoners or had escaped. The sergeant of the askaris had ordered 'no surrender,' but not many native soldiers were hiding in the bush. It seemed like most had given up or become civilians. On a Saturday evening, just before sunset, I arrived at my host's place. We had a simple dinner but had a great conversation. There were three of us at the table - my host, Hunter, and myself. Hunter, a naval officer, accompanied me and stayed the night. He appeared mature for his age, had various interests, and expressed himself well. He seemed a bit cynical about certain things, but my host, the Intelligence Officer, disagreed. He was a patriot and a fighter, with remarkable courage and resourcefulness. His face had a perpetual feverish look, and he had a unique goatee. I couldn't help but notice a resemblance to a medieval character in a print.|"1.

We talked about Intelligence Work, a part of War Service that I might be biased about. To my shameless joy, Hunter excelled in echoing my own thoughts. He criticized the invasion of people's privacy by reading their letters and the manipulation of distressed locals. He vaguely mentioned questionable methods of persuasion. He strongly condemned the degrading uselessness of the spy system on both sides. He concluded with immature comments about individuals he had encountered, some of whom were the host's agents. His remarks about them did not match the eloquence of his earlier speech. The host took it all in good spirits, being a man of action rather than words. He confessed to feeling regret for his actions that day, particularly when he admitted to resorting to torture. He justified it as a means to prevent an innocent person's execution. The conversation then shifted to the treatment of natives, with Hunter showing a cynical attitude, claiming to have abandoned any previous notions of kindness towards them. He believed in using force instead of compassion to avoid any issues. Despite my objections, Hunter remained firm in his beliefs.|"1. What did Hunter criticize regarding Intelligence Work?

We talked about Intelligence Work, a part of War Service that I might be biased about. To my shameless joy, Hunter excelled in echoing my own thoughts. He criticized the invasion of people's privacy by reading their letters and the manipulation of distressed locals. He vaguely mentioned questionable methods of persuasion. He strongly condemned the degrading uselessness of the spy system on both sides. He concluded with immature comments about individuals he had encountered, some of whom were the host's agents. His remarks about them did not match the eloquence of his earlier speech. The host took it all in good spirits, being a man of action rather than words. He confessed to feeling regret for his actions that day, particularly when he admitted to resorting to torture. He justified it as a means to prevent an innocent person's execution. The conversation then shifted to the treatment of natives, with Hunter showing a cynical attitude, claiming to have abandoned any previous notions of kindness towards them. He believed in using force instead of compassion to avoid any issues. Despite my objections, Hunter remained firm in his beliefs.|"6. Despite objections, what did Hunter believe in using towards natives?
A) Compassion
B) Force
C) Kindness
D) Indifference
E) Aggression"|B) Force|Yes
Our host returned and chuckled a bit until he noticed my lack of enjoyment. He then criticized the speaker for overlooking a crucial fact. Wasn't there a limit to his knowledge of Africa? Despite his professed sympathy for Africans, he seemed fixated on them as a hobby, aiming to earn their trust for various reasons. As the conversation shifted, it became more empathetic from my perspective for the rest of the evening until bedtime. We all slept in a spacious room. I had minimal belongings and felt inadequate compared to my naval companion's disdain for the ill-prepared. The host, seemingly oblivious, soon dozed off. In the early hours, a skirmish with red ants disrupted my sleep. Gratefulness should have been my emotion. Little did I know the battalions that might have attacked at dawn. The dawn revealed the extent of their forces. Scout ants caused a moderate nuisance. A nearby cock crowed, signaling the approaching dawn. The storm intensified, reminding me it was Pentecost. The storm unleashed its fury with rain, thunder, and lightning. My host woke up.|"Question 1:

Despite feeling a bit stiff from the bath, Hood felt defiant and cheerful as they walked through the valley under the sun.

In ancient Europe, there was a belief that witches, when wounded in animal form, would bear the same wound when they returned to human form. I once witnessed a lion under the moonlight, its head surrounded by a halo. A Mashona guide with me noticed a scar on its brow, recognizing the lion by this mark. The lion stood expectantly on a rock, dividing two roads, as if waiting. I hurried back to the kraal to fetch Trooper No. 2 for a chance to shoot the lion. Unfortunately, by the time we returned, the lion had disappeared into the bush. This experience unfolded during my search for Carrot, a pioneer now fading away as civilization advanced, much like the eagle in Byron's poem.|"1.

On a splendid autumn night in late May, under a sky filled with falling stars, I found myself in a gloomy camp among ruins. Two troopers, one convalescent and irritable, the other shaken and sulky, sat in silence. As I observed the Black Watch soldiers nearby, one shared ghostly tales of lions. I felt sorry for the troopers, their faces reflecting a mix of emotions. Later, I followed lion tracks in the light of dawn, hoping they would lead me to safety. Instead, they guided me to a hut where a fire burned, but no lion lurked. As the cock crowed, I prayed for guidance, feeling like a seeker in need of answers. The lion's mysterious presence left me in awe, with no trace of its departure.|"1. What was the setting of the text passage?

Later, I sat outside with Greenwood on the sunny stoep as he pointed out the surroundings. In the distance, there was a grove of trees on a nearby ridge and a few thatched buildings nestled among them, one with a white cross on top. Greenwood suggested we visit the Hospice of Saint Lucy to share its story before nightfall, believing it could aid in healing. As the sun set, we set off with his native helpers, each carrying packs.

It housed aids for recovery, including a life-sized image of Saint Lucy with a lantern in hand, set against an African forest backdrop.

Greenwood, after finishing his tasks, demonstrated the Shrine's operations to me. A young mother, adorned and dignified, approached with her baby.

"Dear Sir,

I have been struggling with my fear and prejudice towards people of color, which I refer to as my ""negrophoby."" It feels impossible to rid myself of this deep-rooted feeling.

That night, I had a dream influenced by Marvell's words and the quinine I had taken before sleeping. The dream featured Malaria personified as a sickly figure fleeing into the wilderness.

I admired Marvell for his generosity. He insisted on giving me a guinea for my Mission, even though I told him it wasn't necessary.

Our guide was not a skinny child; he was strong and had a beard, a skilled woodsman. The trees yielded to his powerful swing. But his work took time. We felt embarrassed by the long distances we covered each day. Sunday was a welcome break, and we camped in the rocky area, thankful for the rest. The next day showed the results of our break.

The night brought challenges as we got stuck at a stream, facing rocks and deep mud. The lady from the wagon lightened the load and helped maneuver the wagon. Eventually, we overcame the obstacles. The evening was spent by the fire, discussing our journey, with the lady roasting nuts and us smoking tobacco. Anson praised Mashonaland, calling it a blessed land.

When I described the scenes to Dick, he battled my praises impartially, feeling deeply wounded by his impending banishment. Despite his unfortunate fate, he expressed a desire to return someday. He revealed his chosen burial site where two rivers met, far from our current camp. As we conversed, Delia Moore intervened after roasting monkey-nuts. She believed our paths were predetermined - Dick to depart and me to remain. She felt compelled to move due to church pressure, unsure of gathering any moss. I promised to tend to her west-country work. Reflecting on Africa's essence, I pondered its birth star, symbolized by the Southern Cross. Delia engaged Dick in a spirited debate, while I marveled at the starlit sky above, contemplating Africa's enigmatic ways in guiding our destinies.|"5.

I asked for a day's grace, then defended Africa's femininity. I explained that like a woman at the height of her power with a man, Africa sends Dick away to remember her. It may seem bitter now, but will turn sweet later. A donkey chewing on a pillow-slip caused a commotion. After the mishap, we sat by the fire. Tired, I promised to go to bed after talking. Africa keeps me hanging around, showing me isolated places to work. She knows my weaknesses, making me stay longer. I pledged to stay another day, feeling bound to her. In the morning, I reaffirmed my commitment at a lichen-stained rock altar. We shared breakfast and I gave Dick a motto about Africa.|"1.

In the morning, we searched fruitlessly for a dhow, a type of boat, in creeks and inlets. The light we saw may have come from a German steam-tug. The gunnery-lieutenant suspected something shady in the German harbor. Perhaps they were just transporting food. Despite our patrol's efforts, the dhow's light vanished, leaving us puzzled. A bluejacket shared a tale from a few nights ago, linking a particular tune to luck. He believed we missed an opportunity by not following the light. Maybe we could have achieved more, like capturing Muanza, but our cautious captain held us back. The bluejacket thought the light was a sign, a chance we missed.|"1.
