The ancient beliefs of different cultures regarding the creation of the universe vary greatly. Some believed that gods created mankind, while others thought rival gods evolved from primordial matter. Indian philosophers saw Brahma gradually condensing into material objects and finally into man.

A wise leader, like Moses, must not only have their own ideas but also understand what the people want. In free societies, leaders can only act on policies that the people support. Moses had to convince both the Israelites and Pharaoh to achieve his goals. He used the plagues in Egypt to show the Egyptians the consequences of their actions and to persuade the Israelites to fight for freedom. Moses' understanding of the religious beliefs of his people and the Egyptians helped him seize the right moment to lead the Israelites to freedom. Religion has often been a tool for rulers to influence their people, for better or worse. In the United States, religion played a significant role in the settlement of the New England Colonies. Today, statesmen can still appeal to moral and religious values to promote national and international welfare. To be successful, a leader must genuinely care about the people's well-being and understand their needs and limitations.|"1. What did Moses use the plagues in Egypt for?

In society, laws are made by both judges and legislatures to regulate the complex interests of individuals and classes. Initially, laws focused on preserving life and tribal unity. As societies evolved, laws were enacted to protect private property. With civilization's advancement, legislation began prioritizing societal welfare. However, historically, laws often favored ruling classes over others, as seen in certain ceremonial laws benefiting priests at the people's expense. The foundation of all laws is society's well-being. In early societies, rules were developed for survival and later gained religious sanction. While laws now carry penalties, in humane societies, most citizens obey laws out of goodwill, justice, and religious morality. The Hebrew laws, often attributed to Moses, were based on principles of justice, religion, and equality, evolving as the Israelites settled and adapted. The laws were believed to originate from God, guiding the Israelites in their societal and moral conduct.|"1. What is the main focus of laws in early societies mentioned in the text?

In ancient times, many nations believed their laws came from gods or great heroes. For example, Hammurabi's code was said to be from the god Shamash. Greeks had Solon and Draco's laws, while India had Manu's and China had Confucius'. Laws were often attributed to judges or kings. Nowadays, laws are made by legislative bodies. However, laws need to adapt to changing times. Judges must interpret laws to fit current needs. For instance, if planes drop goods on someone's property, courts must consider laws made before planes existed. Over time, laws have aimed to balance justice and mercy for society's benefit. Initially, in tribal societies, laws were unwritten, based on survival instincts. As societies evolved, laws aimed to promote justice and public welfare. Individualism grew as people learned to question laws for the greater good.|"5. How did laws change as societies evolved according to the passage?

Is it ever right to break a law? Some argue that if a human law conflicts with divine law, it is acceptable to disobey. But who determines divine law? Should individuals, communities, or clergy decide? Was it justified for Abolitionists to break the fugitive slave law? Were they more likely to be correct than the majority who passed the law? If someone finds a law unfair, is smuggling goods acceptable? When is it right to disobey state laws? Should a judge excuse someone who believes breaking the law is their duty? Thoreau refused to pay an unjust tax, hoping to change the law through public opinion. Was John Brown right to use force to free slaves? In the UK, the House of Lords makes laws and serves as the highest court. Should those who make laws also interpret them? These questions raise moral and legal dilemmas that challenge us to consider justice, kindness, and humility in our actions.|"1. Who determines divine law according to the passage?

Christianity differs from most religions by adding a unique twist to the relationship between God and man. While other faiths view this connection as a straight line, Christianity introduces a right angle with a third point, man's brother. The Old Testament's decalogues in Exodus 20-23 establish the early laws guiding the nation's obligations to Jehovah. These ten concise commands were designed for easy memorization, even by children. The division into two groups of five laws aimed to aid memory by associating each law with a finger or thumb. This mnemonic system helped teach fundamental obligations to God and man, a practice still valuable today. The commandments' enduring significance in religious education reflects their concrete teaching approach. The stories of the decalogues' origins in Exodus 20 and 34 vary in details, but both emphasize the importance of loyalty to Jehovah and the need for righteous deeds over ceremonial rituals.|"1.

The Ten Commandments in Exodus 34 may have been the original rules Moses gave to the nation, but later editors recognized the ethical superiority of the familiar Ten Commandments in Exodus 20. These two sets of commandments complement each other, with one focusing on the nation's obligations and the other on individual responsibilities. The prohibition against making graven images likely evolved over time, reflecting a shift in religious practices. While the commandments evolved, the core teachings of Moses are believed to be preserved in the noble decalogue. The differences between the versions in Deuteronomy 5 and Exodus 20 highlight the evolving interpretations and additions made to the commandments over time. The commandments emphasize the worship of one God and the rejection of idols, reflecting the evolving religious practices of the Hebrews.|"1.

"The interpretation of the third commandment, ""Thou shall not invoke the name of Jehovah, thy God, in vain,"" has evolved over time. The original Hebrew meaning is somewhat ambiguous, focusing on the phrase ""in vain."" This phrase could be interpreted in four ways: purposelessly, for destruction, for nothing (swearing falsely), or in the practice of sorcery. Loyalty to God was fundamental in ancient Hebrew society, serving as the cornerstone of both religion and the state. Disloyalty was considered treason and severely punished. Today, loyalty to one's sense of right and to God remains crucial for effective citizenship. The observance of the Sabbath has a long history, possibly originating from moon worship.

"In ancient times, observing the Sabbath by refraining from work was seen as a crucial duty, akin to offering to God. The term ""holy"" in Hebrew means distinct or set apart, making the Sabbath unique from other days. The ethical prophets of the Assyrian era transformed the Sabbath from a pagan ritual to a deeper, more spiritual and humanitarian practice.

However, later on, the original significance of the Sabbath was overshadowed by religious formalities. Jesus, recognizing the true essence of the Sabbath, emphasized its purpose to benefit humanity.

The term ""holy"" in Hebrew means distinct or set apart, making the Sabbath unique from other days. The ethical prophets of the Assyrian era transformed the Sabbath from a pagan ritual to a deeper, more spiritual and humanitarian practice. They emphasized that rest was not just for people but also for animals and foreigners residing among them. These prophets linked the Sabbath to God's care for humanity's physical, mental, and spiritual well-being, essential for individual and societal welfare. However, later on, the original significance of the Sabbath was overshadowed by religious formalities. Jesus, recognizing the true essence of the Sabbath, emphasized its purpose to benefit humanity. This raises questions about the Sabbath's religious versus social interpretations and its observance today. Scientists note that the upbringing and care of offspring contribute to the development of species, suggesting that prolonged education and nurturing lead to greater success in life."|"6. What did the term ""holy"" mean in Hebrew in relation to the Sabbath?

This exclusivity, where only tribe members were welcome, has influenced modern society. While outsiders were not typically accepted, this exclusiveness laid the foundation for patriotism. Similarly, the personal bonds within tribes, unlike the territorial unity of modern states, promote peace and democracy. Jesus, inspired by this tribal connection, referred to all as brothers under a common father. This tribal trait, seen in both Israelites and American Indian tribes, has implications for present and future societies.

In ancient tribes, individuals worked for the community or family, not for personal gain. Each person's main responsibility was to their family leader, not the state. This exclusivity, where only tribe members were welcome, has influenced modern society. While outsiders were not typically accepted, this exclusiveness laid the foundation for patriotism. Similarly, the personal bonds within tribes, unlike the territorial unity of modern states, promote peace and democracy. Jesus, inspired by this tribal connection, referred to all as brothers under a common father. This tribal trait, seen in both Israelites and American Indian tribes, has implications for present and future societies. The lessons from tribal customs hold significance, emphasizing unity and brotherhood for a better future.|"5. What is the significance of the tribal customs for present and future societies?

The ancient Canaanites lived in a land where the civilizations of Egypt, Babylon, and the Amorites influenced them greatly. The Babylonians left a lasting mark on the Canaanites, with most early inscriptions written in Babylonian script.

The ancient Canaanite town ruins, rising between forty and fifty feet above the plain, cover about twelve acres. The excavations revealed a well-built encircling wall still standing, confirming the early Hebrew tradition's accuracy. The foundation was a sixteen-foot-high rubble wall, with a six to eight-foot-thick supplemental burnt brick wall rising another eight feet above it. The citadel at the city's northern end was three stories high, made of unburnt brick. The Hebrews, led by Jehovah's presence symbolized by the ark, captured Jericho. The attack strategy was silent marches followed by a sudden assault, similar to later conquests. The fierce Hebrew warriors left Jericho in ruins, offering its inhabitants as a sacrifice to Jehovah.
