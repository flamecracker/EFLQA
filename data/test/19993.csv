High-feather's mother warned him not to eat buffalo meat before his magic journey. She sewed a mouse's whisker onto his red feather and told him to only eat wild strawberries. As he wandered, eating strawberries, he reached a dancing ring where he turned into a mouse. A family of mice promised to help him. Soon, maidens arrived in a basket from the sky. They danced until the eldest sister sensed the mouse's presence. The mother mouse cleverly escaped with her children. One maiden stayed behind, drawn to High-feather.

The Vizier followed the Caliph's orders as they quietly left the palace without any attendants. They ventured beyond the town to a large pond where elegant storks were often spotted. Among them, a dignified stork was hunting for frogs while another stork flew around him. The Caliph expressed his fascination with storks and desired a closer connection. With a pinch of snuff from a box, their transformation began. Their beards vanished, replaced by feathers, their necks elongated, and their legs turned into red sticks. As they approached the storks, they overheard a conversation about breakfast plans and a dance practice.

The two transformed birds wandered, unable to eat frogs, and witnessed mourning in Bagdad. They realized their enchantment was due to the magician's son seeking revenge.

Once upon a time, in a quaint cottage nestled at the foot of a mountain in green Erin, lived a young girl named Nora. Her home, a charming thatched stone cottage, sat amidst a dense woodland where the sun's rays could only peek through for a few hours each day. This woodland was a favored meeting spot for fairies, where the Little Folk from above and below would gather to dance among the shamrocks under the starlit sky. Nora, though she had heard tales of fairies from her grandmother and mother, had never laid eyes on one herself. Nora, a bit prone to gloominess, found solace in the shelter of rocks above her home, beside a babbling stream. Here, she often placed fresh field flowers in a pool of water to keep them vibrant. From her stone seat, Nora gazed out at a sunny clearing encircled by six majestic beech trees, forming a natural woodland palace.|"1. What is the setting of the story?
