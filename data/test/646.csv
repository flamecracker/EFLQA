Peterkin quickly put on the oversized boots, trousers, and vest, but they were too big even for him. I tried them on too, and although they fit my legs, they were too large for my feet. We passed them to Jack, who gladly accepted them as they suited him perfectly. Jack didn't use them much as they were heavy. As night fell, we postponed our hill climb for the next day. We built a shelter using boughs and leaves to sleep comfortably. We gathered flints for a fire, but they didn't work. Peterkin then realized the spyglass could be a burning glass. Jack used a bow to ignite tinder, and soon we were enjoying a warm fire, sipping lemonade by the light of the flames. The next morning, we woke to the beauty of nature, basking in the tropical sun and exploring the wonders of the ocean.|"1. What did Peterkin realize the spyglass could be used as?

While contemplating, I remembered my Bible, a promise to my mother. Sadly, it remained on the ship. Troubled, I consoled myself by keeping my vow to pray. Quietly rising not to disturb my companions, I stepped aside for this ritual. Returning, finding them asleep, I pondered our predicament. Suddenly, a small parrot caught my eye. Perched above Peterkin, its vibrant plumage fascinated me. The bird comically peered into Peterkin's open mouth. Amused, I imagined the bird falling in, eliciting laughter. Startled, the parrot screeched, awakening Peterkin. Delighted, he reveled in our surroundings, eventually plunging into the sea. Jack, an adept swimmer, joined him.

After preparing ourselves and putting out the fire, we ventured out along the shore until we reached a valley entrance with a flowing stream. The view upon entering the valley was stunning, with gentle rises on each side covered in lush trees and shrubs. The ridges on either side extended inland and met a small mountain ahead.

We were puzzled by the discovery of a large tree stump on the mountaintop, unlike what the crew of a ship would cut. Jack speculated that savages might have cut it for a mysterious purpose. While clearing moss from the stump, Jack found three marks resembling initials but weathered beyond recognition. Perplexed, we left for the island's summit, revealing a breathtaking view of our surroundings. The island had two mountains, a lush valley, and a beach encircled by a coral reef. The calm lagoon contrasted the roaring surf outside the reef. We noted small islets marking the reef openings and other uninhabited islands in the distance.

From our vantage point on the mountain, we observed many things before deciding to head back. We found signs of human presence like a pole and some squared wood, indicating past inhabitants. Despite their decay, these remnants stirred our curiosity. On our return journey, we stumbled upon tracks left by an unknown animal, heightening our hopes of finding food. Excited by our discoveries, we returned to our camp. In the following days, we stayed close, contemplating our future and making our shelter cozier. Uncertainties about settling permanently and the possibility of natives or a passing ship delayed our plans. We experimented with cooking coconut and tried fishing with makeshift tools. Jack fashioned a knife from hoop-iron, and Peterkin used a freed whip-cord as a fishing line. The desire for more substantial catches led to a new fishing strategy, prompting an adventurous plan to venture into deeper waters for a better catch.|"Question 1: What did the group find on the mountain that stirred their curiosity?

As he began to slice through the stem once more, about six yards from the thick end, he then fashioned three sturdy poles from the branches to roll the log down to the sea. The log, being nearly two feet thick, required these levers to move it. With the poles, we managed to slowly roll it into the water. After successfully launching our makeshift boat, we turned the levers into basic oars and attempted to embark. Balancing on the log was challenging, but we managed to stay afloat. While fishing, a large fish swallowed the bait, causing us to lose balance and fall into the water. Despite the mishap, we recovered and continued fishing, until a shark appeared nearby, prompting us to paddle frantically towards shore to avoid an attack.|"1.

Now, we were about to give up all the fun we had been having, and when we thought of it, Jack and I felt very down. I could see that Peterkin was sad too, for he stopped teasing us about it. But when people face problems, they often come up with ways to solve them and find better things.

It was a beautiful spot with clear water, colorful corals, and marine life. We then planned to explore the whole island to find useful things and a better place to live. Jack suggested we make weapons for protection and hunt for small animals for food. Peterkin agreed to make arrows, and Jack would make bows.

Peterkin walked beside us as we strolled along the sandy beach of our island. When we roamed through the woods, we walked in a line, one after the other, to move easily in each other's footsteps.

Shortly after this, we discovered a remarkable tree with a unique structure that turned out to be very helpful to us. It was a magnificent chestnut tree, although Jack didn't know its exact name. The tree was laden with fine nuts that we collected. What made this tree extraordinary was its trunk. It grew about twelve feet tall without any branches, and despite not being thick, it had several remarkable projections along its stem. These projections resembled planks attached closely to the trunk from the ground up to the branches, covered with the tree's bark. These natural buttresses supported the tree's heavy canopy. We also found numerous chestnuts of various sizes growing along the stream banks. As we made our way back to the coast to camp by the beach due to mosquitoes in the forest, we admired the colorful birds around us, including paroquets, turtledoves, and wood-pigeons. We attempted to hunt for food but only succeeded in catching a pigeon by slinging a stone at it. Later, we spotted a flock of wild ducks flying towards the coast and discovered a beautiful blue lake where they landed.|"1.

Shortly after this, we discovered a remarkable tree with a unique structure that turned out to be very helpful to us. It was a magnificent chestnut tree, although Jack didn't know its exact name. The tree was laden with fine nuts that we collected. What made this tree extraordinary was its trunk. It grew about twelve feet tall without any branches, and despite not being thick, it had several remarkable projections along its stem. These projections resembled planks attached closely to the trunk from the ground up to the branches, covered with the tree's bark. These natural buttresses supported the tree's heavy canopy. We also found numerous chestnuts of various sizes growing along the stream banks. As we made our way back to the coast to camp by the beach due to mosquitoes in the forest, we admired the colorful birds around us, including paroquets, turtledoves, and wood-pigeons. We attempted to hunt for food but only succeeded in catching a pigeon by slinging a stone at it. Later, we spotted a flock of wild ducks flying towards the coast and discovered a beautiful blue lake where they landed.|"2. What did the natural buttresses on the tree trunk support?

After being advised, I threw a stone that hit a hog, causing it to run away. Simultaneously, Jack's arrow pinned a little pig to the ground. As we prepared to camp, Peterkin was missing. We heard a shriek in the distance, followed by hogs' yells. Peterkin returned hungry, leading us to a feast of pig, taro-root, yam, potato, plums, and wood-pigeon. Jack expertly cooked the pig and pigeon over the fire. The taro-root resembled a potato and tasted great. The yam was sweet, and the potato surprisingly palatable. After a luxurious supper, we slept under a coral rock ledge. The next morning, we woke up late after a heavy meal but felt strong and refreshed after a morning bathe.|"1.

I often wonder why people in my country don't use water more for cold baths. It may not be easy to go to the sea or rivers in winter, but a tub and a sponge work well. The freshness and vigor I felt after bathing were delightful. I recommend daily cold baths for a refreshing start. I've heard of the cold-water-cure but can't say much about it. Too much or too little of a good thing could be harmful. I believe it's better to risk too much than have too little. Daylight lessens fears, as we discovered on our journey. We saw what we thought was an army, but they were penguins. We continued our journey, eager to explore more of the island.|"1. What does the speaker recommend for a refreshing start?

We observed that while most fruit trees grew in valleys or near streams with rich soil, the coconut palm thrived everywhere, even on the sandy coral reef. The tree's roots were sprayed by the sea, yet they grew as lush as those in the valleys, yielding equally refreshing fruit. On a high mountain, we found shells and coral, suggesting the island was once submerged or the sea was higher. We pondered how the island rose, with theories ranging from volcanic eruption to spontaneous elevation. Noticing the different rock types, we debated the island's geological history. Following mysterious footprints, we encountered a blind, deaf wild cat that showed extreme joy upon meeting us, hinting at past human contact.|"1. What is the main idea of the text passage?

We decided to follow the trail further, and Peterkin carried the weak cat in his arms as it fell asleep. As we advanced, we encountered more felled trees, leading us to a stream where a rudimentary bridge once stood. Moss-covered stones scattered in the water indicated its former presence. Continuing on, we stumbled upon a small, desolate hut nestled under bread-fruit trees. The sight left us in silent awe, enveloped by a melancholic stillness. The cottage, measuring twelve by ten feet, showed signs of neglect with moss and decay covering every surface. Inside, we found only a wooden stool, an iron pot, and two skeletons - one of a man and the other of a dog. The discovery moved us deeply, prompting us to search for clues about the solitary man's identity, but all we found were remnants of clothing and an old axe, hinting at a tragic tale lost to time.|"1.

After exploring the island, we stumbled upon a lonely hut with a tree stump bearing initials nearby. We pondered the fate of a castaway who may have once lived there. Speculating on his story, we debated whether he was a shipwreck survivor or a runaway sailor. The presence of a cat and dog added to the mystery. The dog, loyal to the end, died beside its master, while the cat roamed alone. We dismantled the hut to create a grave for the unknown man and his faithful companions. Exhausted from our journey, we returned to our bower for much-needed rest, finding solace in the tranquility of the evening. Rest, we realized, is essential for both body and mind, offering relief from life's trials.|"1. What did the explorers find near the lonely hut on the island?

After exploring the island, we stumbled upon a lonely hut with a tree stump bearing initials nearby. We pondered the fate of a castaway who may have once lived there. Speculating on his story, we debated whether he was a shipwreck survivor or a runaway sailor. The presence of a cat and dog added to the mystery.

After we woke up feeling very refreshed, we were worried that we might have lost track of a day. We had been keeping count of the days since we arrived on the island to remember the Sabbath. We all agreed on how long we had slept, which eased our minds. We hurried to the Water Garden for a swim and to check on the animals in the tank. Unfortunately, most of the animals were dead, and the water was in a bad state. Peterkin pointed out that the water was too salty for the animals from the ocean. Jack suggested making the tank like a miniature Pacific Ocean by adding sea water and sea creatures. He also advised adding fresh water when needed to maintain the right salt level. Peterkin joked about needing three little men to dive in to make it perfect.|"1. What were the characters worried about after waking up on the island?

We quickly bent over the tank and were quite amused by the behavior of one of the surviving crabs. It was a small crab commonly found along the coasts of England. As we watched, its back split away from its body, revealing a soft lump that wriggled and grew. Soon, it transformed into a bunch of crab legs, and the crab emerged complete from its old shell, leaving it behind. We were astonished at this sight, especially when we noticed the new crab was larger than the old one. We learned that crabs grow by shedding their shells through this fascinating process. Inspired by this, I followed Jack's advice on tank preparation, which proved to be successful beyond my expectations. This experience made me wish to share the wonders of marine life with those living inland, so they too could witness the mysteries of the sea.|"1. What behavior of the crab amused the onlookers?

Jack and I decided to explore a mysterious underwater cave. We crafted a torch using bark and resin, wrapped it in coconut cloth, and set off into the dark waters.

The floor rippled like water, and the walls sparkled as if studded with gems. The ceiling displayed intricate patterns, resembling cathedral fretwork. Despite our deep exploration, we couldn't reach the cave's end due to our dwindling torch. The only light seeped through the cave's mouth, reflecting off a massive white coral rock near the entrance.

After exploring the cavern, we put out the torch and left it in a dry spot, thinking we might need it if the torch got wet during future dives. As we waited for our eyes to adjust to the darkness, we marveled at the stillness and gloom around us. The thought of the magnificent dome above and the sparkling gems in the torchlight made us ponder on the wonders unseen by many. Plunging into the water, we dived through the narrow entrance and emerged panting on the rocks, greeted by our friend Peterkin. Breathing the fresh air and basking in the sunshine after our adventure in the Diamond Cave felt refreshing. We discussed the peculiar tides of the island, noting their regularity and the lack of twilight, which sometimes caught us off guard during our hunts.

Peterkin explained that although his current shoes were not related to the pig they had just killed, the pig would play a role in making his future shoes. He had decided not to kill another pig after seeing Ralph skillfully take down the first one. Remembering his need for leather or tough material for shoes, he chose to use the tough old grandmother pig. They planned to carry the heavy pig home by tying its feet together and passing the spear handle between them. Jack and Peterkin carried the pig while Peterkin humorously remarked on their successful hunt. Jack worked tirelessly on building a boat using materials from a chestnut tree. He shaped the boat's keel and ribs using an axe and a makeshift pipe from hoop-iron to bore holes. They used iron-wood pegs and coconut husk cordage to secure the boat's structure. Despite the challenges, Jack's determination and resourcefulness led to the successful construction of the boat.|"1. What did Peterkin decide to use for making his future shoes?

Planks were cut from the chestnut trees, about an inch thick, and shaped with an axe, though clumsily. Five planks on each side formed the boat, rounded like a barrel to reduce twisting. Instead of nails, we sewed the planks together using tough cordage, stitching them to the stem, stern, and keel. We added layers of coconut fiber between planks for waterproofing. The boat's interior was coated with pitch and coconut cloth, making it watertight. While Jack worked on the boat, Peterkin and I hunted ducks on mud-flats nearby. Our suppers were varied, and we often shared with our cat. Our table was a coral rock where we feasted on breadfruit, roast pig, duck, and more, washed down with coconut lemonade. Peterkin's culinary experiments were less successful, but we celebrated the boat's early completion with joy.|"1. What material were the planks of the boat made from?

Initially, we rowed aimlessly in our small boat, filled with excitement. But as our spirits settled, we pondered our next move. With four oars made but only two needed, the spare pair was kept in case of mishaps. Two rowed while the third steered. Landing on small islands yielded nothing noteworthy. On a larger one with coconut trees, we enjoyed a breakfast of nuts. Venturing to the coral reef, the grandeur of the open sea's breakers mesmerized us. The colossal waves crashed with thunderous force, captivating us. Observing the reef, we marveled at the coral's growth and the formation of islands. We contemplated the mechanics behind the creation of large coral islands, a mystery we couldn't solve. The idea of protecting our boat's keel from wear eluded us due to the lack of iron.|"1.

Jack instructed Peterkin to gather coconut fiber to make sewing twine. Next, they would cut coconut cloth to create a sail for their boat. Jack also devised a false keel to enhance the boat's stability. With the mast, sail, and rigging set up, they launched the boat into the lagoon. They enjoyed sailing, admiring the island's view and observing the underwater life. Peterkin fished with hooks made from various materials, including ironwood, fish bones, and a brass finger ring. The brass hook proved most successful, attracting a variety of fish. They marveled at porpoises, swordfish, whales, and sharks in the lagoon. Jack recounted a tale of a swordfish attacking a ship, showing the incredible strength of these creatures.|"1. What did Jack instruct Peterkin to gather to make sewing twine?

Sharks were rare in our waters, but we made a rule to always have someone in the boat as a lookout for any signs of danger. Whales, on the other hand, were a common sight beyond the reef, their spouts visible from afar. The first time we encountered a massive sperm whale up close was unforgettable. Its sheer size was astounding, and the force with which it dived back into the sea left us in awe. We also marveled at flying fish trying to escape dolphins, and the mystery of fish appearing in shallow pools after rain. Our fishing trips were fruitful, providing us with eels, turtles for soup, and an array of shrimps and prawns. Each week brought new discoveries, whether on land or at sea.|"1.

The massive wave crashed over the reef with a deafening roar, shaking the rocks as it rolled towards us. The water spouted violently from the reef's holes, drenching us in a spray that left us stunned and blinded. The wave surged across the lagoon, smashing onto the island's beach, toppling trees and bushes in its path. We feared our bower and boat were lost. To our relief, the bower was spared, but the boat was missing. After a frantic search, we spotted it nestled in a bush, unharmed by the wave's force. It took us two days of hard work to retrieve the boat. We then cleared the debris, restoring the area to its former state. This phenomenon occurs yearly in the Pacific, a fact shared by missionaries. After tidying up, we readied ourselves to visit the penguins, repairing the boat and stocking provisions for the journey.|"1. What effect did the massive wave have on the island?

"While observing the penguins on the island, we noticed some peculiar behavior among the adult penguins and their young. The older penguins seemed to be teaching their offspring how to swim by nudging them into the water. It was both amusing and fascinating to watch as the young penguins hesitated before taking the plunge. The older penguins displayed a mix of tenderness and determination in guiding their young into the sea.

As we continued to observe, a group of penguins clumsily made their way towards the water. Some of them managed to navigate the rocky slope successfully, while others tumbled down in a comical manner. Once in the water, the penguins transformed, diving and splashing with incredible agility.

Despite initial concerns about the penguins' behavior, we found them to be peaceful creatures. Our encounter with these unique birds left us in awe of their abilities and behaviors. Eventually, as night fell, we faced a challenging journey back to our camp due to a sudden gale, forcing us to navigate the rough seas back to Penguin Island."|"1.

As Jack spoke, the wind suddenly changed direction, forcing us to adjust the sail to head towards the island. Strong gusts and squalls made our journey difficult. We trusted Jack's judgment, but anxiety crept in as the situation worsened. A heavy squall hit us, nearly capsizing the boat. Despite our efforts, water flooded in. Jack spotted a low rock ahead and steered us towards it. With skillful maneuvering, we found refuge in a narrow creek. Though safe, our surroundings were treacherous. The storm raged on, enveloping us in water. We sought shelter in a small cave, grateful for the dry respite. Nightfall brought darkness and terror, the storm intensifying. Lightning illuminated our precarious situation, while thunder roared, and waves threatened to wash us away. The dawn's arrival brought relief and gratitude for surviving the harrowing night.|"1.

Jack and I were sitting on the rocks at Spouting Cliff, and Peterkin was wringing water from his clothes after falling into the sea by accident. Suddenly, we saw two objects on the horizon.

I was very shocked to hear about the brutal ways of the natives from Bill, who had experience trading in the islands. He shared a chilling story of how a captain he sailed with callously killed a friendly chief over a trade disagreement and even shot six locals to protect his business. Bill explained that shipwrecked individuals, dead or alive, were doomed to be roasted and eaten by the natives. He mentioned a tragic incident where three survivors of a shipwreck were captured and devoured by the islanders. Bill advised that escaping from the current ship might be risky, but heading to islands near Tahiti where the natives were Christians could offer safety. Despite not understanding Christianity fully, Bill believed it transformed the natives into peaceful people. He suggested that they could plan to escape by cutting the boat adrift one night during their watch, but the dangers of being caught by the islanders made it a risky plan.|"1.

Bill bid me farewell, and a crewmate took his place at the helm. Not inclined to chat, I gazed at the glowing waves while feeling sorrowful. Memories of my time on the Coral Island with friends Jack and Peterkin made me tearful. I worried about their search for me. Suddenly, a red glow in the south and distant thunder caught our attention, followed by a shower of ashes from a volcano many miles away. As we sailed onward, the volcano's glare and thunder persisted. Days later, we neared a lush island with two towering mountains and a river leading to the shore. The island was known for sandalwood, but the crew's past actions had strained relations with the natives. Upon anchoring, the captain and armed crew rowed ashore to meet the island's chief, Romata, who welcomed them warmly.|"1. What caught the crew's attention while sailing?

After a brief chat, we were served a meal of roasted pigs and various roots. We ate modestly before getting down to business. The captain explained his reason for coming to the island, expressed regret for any past misunderstandings, and hoped for a successful trade.

He admired the ship and was fascinated by a musket, mistaking it for a tree-cutting tool. Romata was amazed by the ship's cannon and requested a demonstration, which left him in awe.

After that, I eagerly gazed at the sails, regretting my hasty decision to lower them. I briefly considered raising the main-top sail again, but realized it would take too long and decided against it. With the island just two hours away at our current speed, I abandoned the idea. I busied myself preparing for our arrival, knowing my friends wouldn't be up before 6 a.m., and it was only 3. I readied the anchor, planning to dock opposite the bower. Luckily, the anchor was ready to use, saving me time. I raised the black flag and loaded the cannon. As we approached the reef entrance, I turned the ship towards the Water Garden. I dropped anchor, fired the cannon, and startled my friends who emerged from the bower. They recognized me, and we joyfully reunited in the water. After our emotional reunion, we spent three days catching up on our adventures.|"1. What did the speaker do as they approached the island?

About a month after I arrived, news reached me that the chief had passed away. He was the father of the current chief, who is now a devout member of the church. In this region, it is customary that when a chief dies, his wives are strangled and buried alongside him. Upon learning this, I rushed to his residence to try and prevent such a cruel act. Unfortunately, when I arrived, two wives had already been killed, and a third was in the process of being strangled. I made a fervent plea for her life, but it was too late; she had already perished. I then implored the son to spare the fourth wife, and after much hesitation, he agreed. However, within half an hour, the woman regretted her decision and insisted on being strangled, which was carried out. To my surprise, it turned out that the old chief was not actually deceased but was being buried alive as part of a custom where the heir deposes his father. Despite my efforts to intervene, the old chief was interred alive alongside his wives. Subsequently, the new chief, now in charge, approached me with his god and requested that it be burned.

As we turned onto a wide path towards the hill, we heard the shouts of a group approaching from behind. We stepped aside into the bushes and watched as they drew closer. It was a procession of natives, some dancing wildly with painted faces and bodies in black, red, and yellow. Among them, a group of men carried planks with seated men tied to them. I felt a chill, fearing they might be victims of a cruel ritual. The men, however, were already deceased, having been part of a battle the day before. Following them was a man being led with his hands bound, showing no fear. The procession led us to a temple with a circular structure, littered with human bones and skulls. Inside, a priest dissected bodies with wooden knives. The bodies were then taken to be baked in a fire. The crowd rushed to a hill where a house frame awaited.

Arriving at the site, we witnessed a large crowd gathered around a specific area. We edged closer and observed a wooden beam lying on the ground next to parts of a house frame. Near one end was a hole, deep and wide. Suddenly, the man with bound hands was brought into the circle. Although his hands were now free, his legs were tightly strapped together. The house post was then lowered into the hole, and the man placed beside it, his head below the surface and arms wrapped around the post. Earth was shoveled in until everything was covered and compressed. This was a customary ritual during the opening of a new temple or a chief's abode. Jack's face turned pale as we rushed back to our teacher, worried about Avatea's safety among the fierce savages. Upon our return, Tararo and his followers arrived with food baskets. Jack demanded Avatea's freedom to join the Christians, but Tararo refused. Threatening with his ship's cannon, Jack insisted on Avatea's release. Suddenly, Avatea appeared among the fruits and vegetables, prompting Jack to rescue her, facing a fierce challenge from the natives until the teacher intervened. Tararo acknowledged Jack's bravery and allowed him to live but detained his schooner for further consideration.|"1. What was the purpose of lowering the house post into the hole in the ground?

Our paddles swiftly sliced through the water, propelling our canoe like a dolphin over the calm sea. Jack's hopeful voice cut through the tension as he spotted what seemed like land ahead. Despite the odds, we paddled with all our might, determined to outpace our pursuers - a war-canoe filled with fierce warriors. Our hearts sank as the supposed land turned out to be a fog bank, dashing our hopes. Exhausted and facing imminent capture, we turned to confront our enemies.

In the village, the dreadful scene unfolded. Roofs were ripped off houses, some structures flattened to the ground. Natives scurried about, saving goods or themselves from the swirling destruction. The tempest was fierce on land, but fiercer at sea. Enormous billows rose from the deep, crashing onto the beach, shaking the earth. Waves surged higher, flooding the village, wrecking homes. Seeking food, famished, we forgot danger, focusing on survival. Captured once more, despite resistance, we faced an uncertain fate. Confined, fear loomed, longing for freedom grew. Despair set in, yearning for release, even death. Amid darkness, flickers of hope emerged, reminiscing about the past, distracting from the grim present. Peterkin dreamt of our Coral Island home, a stark contrast to our reality. Imprisonment took its toll, dimming our spirits. Jack's comforting words eased Peterkin's sorrow, uniting us in silent solidarity. Unexpectedly, our captor freed us, leaving us stunned and uncertain.
