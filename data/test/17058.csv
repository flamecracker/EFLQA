The fleet sailed far from land, facing strong winds and lively seas with choppy waves. Despite the challenging conditions, the submarines handled the sea adeptly. Orders were given for the 'Hastings' and 'Thor' to maintain specific positions at a distance. As the boats advanced at a reduced speed, the young skipper directed all hands to be on deck. Spotting the semi-submerged derelict ahead, the crew increased their speed, alerting the other vessel. The rival craft also spotted the derelict and attempted to reach it first. The young commander, Captain Jack, coordinated the operation from the conning tower, ensuring the engines were not overwhelmed. A sudden explosion near the derelict sent a massive spray into the air, signaling a dramatic turn of events.|"1. What did the crew do upon spotting the semi-submerged derelict ahead?
