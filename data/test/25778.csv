Shortly after, the passengers heard lively dance music playing, and quickly, many of the younger passengers rushed to the Grand Salon. Dancing came naturally to Polly, and she moved gracefully, just like when she rode horses on the ranch or hiked in the Rockies. Kenneth Evans, the youngest man in the group, guided Polly through the dancers, drawing much attention. Meanwhile, Tom sulked as he watched Polly dance, refusing to join in despite being a sought-after dance partner. Eleanor, dancing with Paul, was thoroughly enjoying herself, forgetting about others' romantic entanglements. An impish resistance overcame Polly, leading her to tell Tom to engage in conversations about work and money with other men, as she preferred youthful fun. Tom, hurt by her words, left without a word, feeling shattered. Meanwhile, Kenneth was puzzled by the situation, not understanding girls' subtleties. Tom, feeling miserable, sat in the smoking room until a friend, John, told him Anne wanted to speak with him. Anne, perceiving Tom's disappointment, advised him on understanding Polly's behavior.|"1.

Orders were given to pack up camp quickly. The men toiled through the night, stowing gear, tools, and movable machinery inside the cave. They sealed the cave against winter storms and set off on horseback along Top Notch Trail. As they left the mine around noon, they stopped at a crest for lunch. The horses grazed on Buffalo grass, and a fire was started for cooking. Tom and John tried fishing when thunder rumbled. Suddenly, a massive avalanche on Grizzly Peak startled them. The men were amazed as the snow-capped peak disappeared, replaced by a cloud of debris. The avalanche thundered down the mountain, uprooting trees and boulders, filling ravines along the way. The ranch below narrowly escaped being buried under the tons of debris. Despite the danger, the miners finished their meal and rode back to assess the damage. Anne at the ranch witnessed the peak's top break off and the avalanche unfold. The ranch shook, prompting fears for the safety of the miners.

Jack Baxter visited me one evening before heading to the West. He mentioned that your remarkable young friend had all the qualities to enjoy life to the fullest, yet she chose a profession over parties and suitors. This is why I wanted to meet you girls again. It's refreshing to find a young lady who takes life seriously. Nowadays, most young girls only think about cigarettes, movies, and fashion. It's disheartening to see my rooms filled with cigarette smoke, but what can a hostess do when the women are so engrossed in this habit? The danger lies in their inability to break free from this influence easily.
