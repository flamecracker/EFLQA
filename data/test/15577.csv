Mr. Wilson lived near Cincinnati with his wife for over fifty years, surrounded by cherished books he had read diligently. Initially, Mr. Winthrop B. Smith solely owned the McGuffey Readers until he partnered with Edward and Daniel Sargent. Due to high transportation costs, Mr. Smith collaborated with a New York firm for publishing. The Civil War caused disruptions, prompting Mr. Smith to retire. A new company, Sargent, Wilson & Hinkle, emerged in 1863. They supplied schoolbooks to the South during the war. After the war, the firm evolved, admitting Lewis Van Antwerp and later Robert Quincy Beer. The firm dissolved in 1868, becoming Wilson, Hinkle & Co.

The McGuffey Readers were known for their enduring impact on education. Teachers who used them became so familiar that they could correct work without the book in hand. While today's focus is often on new methods, the nature of children remains constant. Just as Socrates and Plato studied in ancient Greece, today's children share similar interests and thought processes. Education aims to encourage independent thinking and self-activity. While factual readers provide useful information, those that inspire moral values and elevate character through literature hold greater importance. The early versions of the readers emphasized moral teachings directly, but later revisions allowed students to deduce moral lessons themselves. The belief that Americans desire moral education for their children led to the creation of these readers. The initial prices of the readers were modest, and the preservation of early copies has faced challenges over the years.|"1.
