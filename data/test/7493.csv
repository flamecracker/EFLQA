During the intense battle, the red men flanking the patriots caused chaos with their continuous fire. The Indians on the Tory left split into six groups, yelling to boost morale. The Americans faced deadly accuracy from the Indians, especially a powerful group on the left. As confusion reigned and some mistook orders, an elderly man, too feeble to fight, felt a surge of strength. Amid the chaos, young Ben Ripley stood steady, earning praise for his composure. Amid conflicting commands and a panic, Ben found himself facing an Iroquois warrior. Another warrior, Omas, intervened, pulling Ben away from danger. Omas swiftly led Ben away from the battle, protecting him from pursuing enemies. In a moment of respite, Omas released Ben, and they exchanged silent understanding as they sought safety.|"1.

The surprising discovery left him feeling worried. He rushed back to the sleeping group, initially planning to wake them and head back into the woods. After a few moments, his mind calmed down. He realized that the Indians, if they followed their trail, would be forced to take a longer route. The disappearance of the three warriors puzzled him. As the group moved cautiously, the mother assured the children that she would pray once they found a safe spot. The fear of the Indians kept their conversations brief and movements cautious.

I am at a disadvantage in recounting the remarkable meeting between Linna, a young Delaware girl, and three hostile warriors who were pursuing the Ripleys in the wilderness. Linna, with her strong memory, later described the encounter. The fears of the Ripleys were justified as the warriors toyed with them. Linna, knowing her father Omas was a renowned warrior, recognized one of the Senecas, Red Wolf. Red Wolf hesitated to harm the family due to Omas' reputation. The Senecas, however, were determined to capture the Ripleys, disregarding Omas' potential wrath. Despite Linna's keen observation, she did not fully grasp the situation, as the warriors' actions were meant to deceive her. This signaled that Omas had to choose a side, friend or foe, as the Senecas were resolute in their pursuit of the fugitives.|"1. What is the main reason the warriors hesitated to harm the Ripleys?
