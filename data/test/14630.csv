Ruth Fielding was deeply intrigued by the young man injured in the railroad wreck. At the Red Mill that evening, she made a hero of him to her friends.

A dock held a steamer trapped by ice, while a railroad vanished into thick woods. Young folks were fixated on Cliff Island, miles away. Shrouded in snow, the island boasted a hunting lodge at one end. At the other, a rocky promontory soared with a lone pine atop. The western side was jagged with boulders, some bare of snow, standing out starkly. The actual cliff, for which the island was named, was hidden. The townsfolk left the inn when the sun peeked out, and ox teams cleared paths. Kids and Mrs. Tingley headed to the dock, singing. A boat with sweeps was the chosen mode to navigate the icy lake to Cliff Island. Mrs. Tingley was wary but agreed it was safe. Jerry was to be fetched back by Rufe Blent, with a constable in tow, under dubious charges. The boat edged through the ice, and Mrs. Tingley fretted for the safety of the children.|"1.

"The young woodsman, still suspicious, admitted, ""It's mighty nice of you."" He then guided her through a narrow passage from the circular cave to the creek, where her friends were expected. The path alternated between a tunnel and cuts in the hills, revealing the sky above. The gradual descent followed a water-course that led to a swift stream. Emerging behind thick brush, they were hidden from view. Jerry, setting down the lantern and rifle, explained how the water-trail could confuse pursuers like Lem Daggett. Ruth shared how Jerry had rescued her and left her by the stream. The group on Cliff Island made the most of being snowed in, enjoying games and a candy pull.
