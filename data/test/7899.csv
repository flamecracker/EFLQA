Imagine a calm lake. It appears motionless, but when a stone is tossed in, ripples spread out until they reach the shore. Similar to this, hitting a drum creates sound waves that travel outward. Electricity works in a similar way; it remains dormant until activated. Just as the lake ripples after a stone is thrown, and sound waves emanate from a drum when struck, electricity needs a disturbance to create waves. Hertz discovered how to generate and transmit these waves, allowing communication across vast distances. The doctor explains that the wireless telephone converts sound into electricity and back, amplifying it significantly. This advancement in technology allows sound to travel around the world at incredible speeds. By understanding and utilizing this technology, we can benefit from improved communication and education.|"1. What is the main idea of the text?

Working with wire proved to be a challenging task for the boys. They had to wind the wire carefully, ensuring it lay smooth without any gaps between coils. There were moments when they had to unwind and rewind coils multiple times before achieving a satisfactory result. Despite the difficulties, they managed to finish the task with pride. Joe compared their work to a coil he saw in New York, feeling it looked just as good. Bob, on the other hand, believed they could have done it just as well, albeit taking longer. As they contemplated mounting the core with sliding contacts, they decided to pause for the night. The mention of apple pie and milk from Bob's mother prompted them to rush upstairs, joking about who would get the smallest piece. Jimmy, arriving last, engaged in a playful argument about pie etiquette with Bob, all while enjoying the delicious treat.|"1. What was the main challenge the boys faced while working with wire?
