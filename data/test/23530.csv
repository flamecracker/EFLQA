A figure emerged, a woman in distress, clinging desperately to the horse's mane.

Many hours were spent by the Englishmen trying to uncover the hidden Temple of Hydas, but its mystery eluded all their attempts. They also failed to find any remnants of the shattered slab that could have assisted them in their quest. Their search for Appoyas, who vanished while his cry for revenge echoed through the Cave of Hydas, was equally fruitless.

Nestled in the East, where the Indian Ocean meets the China Sea, lies the Malay Peninsula, one of the least explored regions despite its significance as a gateway to valuable island territories.

We eluded the Mongols upon entering the mountains, crossing lush forests and dense jungles. The Sakis might have spotted us, but we were preoccupied with avoiding reptiles and wild animals. Phil, our young and enthusiastic ethnographist, anticipated encountering unique human specimens. Stewart, recounting a close call in Sumatra, was interrupted to spare us the harrowing details. As we trekked along the river, flanked by a thick forest of palms, ebony, and bamboo, we planned to blaze a trail through the thicket to reach the towering mountains. Our journey was arduous, navigating the swift river and facing ferocious crocodiles. Stewart pondered the crocs' voracious appetite and speculated on their adaptation to the climate.

As we approached the dark mountains, the river's path narrowed into a deep gorge where the rushing waters resembled a massive mill-race flood. To avoid the danger of falling into the abyss, we sought refuge in the forest. Despite the high altitude, the air remained damp and oppressive, with occasional foul odors that made us feel faint. We discovered that these noxious vapors emanated from large cactus-like plants in the area. One of these plants, with wide leaves and a bulbous flower, emitted toxic gases. When one of us touched the plant, it bit back, revealing itself as a carnivorous species. After a close encounter with the plant, we encountered a strange creature in the trees, which startled us with its human-catlike eyes. As we continued, we were attacked by a group of wild beings hurling sharp darts, prompting us to defend ourselves cautiously.|"1. What did the rushing waters in the deep gorge resemble?

On a bright September day, I anchored my yacht, the _Thelma_, in a serene East-coast estuary, relishing my escape from the City's hustle. Alone, I spent the day fishing lazily under the sun's warmth, with no one in sight but a private wherry nearby. As the afternoon waned, a sudden chill heralded the arrival of a thick sea-fog, prompting me to hastily row back to the _Thelma_ before it engulfed the estuary. Grateful for the flood tide aiding my swift return, I barely made it back as the mist encroached.

The lantern, hanging above, cast a gentle glow, the kettle hummed on the stove, and the freshly caught fish tasted heavenly. I take pride in my cooking skills during these moments. The bustling city of London and the worries of daily life felt distant, like they belonged to another world. It must have been around 10 p.m., with no moon in sight and a fog thicker than I had ever experienced. Initially, I could barely see anything beyond the cabin's light, just the mizzen-mast behind and the lower part of the main-mast ahead; everything else was hidden in the dense mist. The eerie silence was broken only by the occasional distant hoot of a steamer's horn, likely a coal ship cautiously navigating through the fog. As I settled in for the night, a scream pierced the stillness, distant and muffled, sending shivers down my spine. Unsure of its origin, I listened intently but heard nothing more. Eventually, I convinced myself it was a mere figment of my imagination and drifted off to sleep.

John, with a lazy drawl, remarked that being late wasn't worth fussing over. He believed in taking things easy, quoting his Irish friend's advice to be as easy as possible.

We arrived on the upper deck, a place filled with figures in cloaks and capes, damp and quiet. The bridge marked the front part of the upper deck, where the helmsman steered the ship, glancing between the compass and the bow. The captain paced between the paddle-boxes, scanning the foggy sky ahead.
