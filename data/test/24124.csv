Once more, the captain approached, consulting with Paul before returning to the quarter-deck without comment. The two mischievous crew members reported to the first lieutenant, escalating the issue to Captain Shuffles, who sent them to the principal. Ordered to await investigation in their mess-rooms, the hatchway closed, and the capstan was manned for the third time. Despite some seamen still affected, the anchor was successfully heaved. However, chaos ensued as only a portion of the sails dropped simultaneously. The crew's confusion was deliberate, with the intent to disrupt the operation. The midshipmen and masters struggled to untangle the mess, eventually resolving it. The crew's behavior verged on mutiny, with many involved in the orchestrated chaos.

The ship continued sailing smoothly, despite the worsening weather. At eight o'clock, the starboard watch, led by the first and third lieutenants, took over the deck while the port watch went below. All passengers were feeling well, and after supper, some students decided to challenge the ship's rules by gathering in the mess-rooms. Among them were forty-four individuals, including eighteen runaways turned seamen who were troublemakers. These troublemakers instigated others to rebel against the ship's authority. One student named Raymond led the group, aiming for a peaceful protest seeking explanation from the principal.

Raymond's group, angered by Hyde's desertion, faced a bleak future but held onto pride. Anxious and weary, they retired as night fell. As the wind picked up, sails were reefed for safety. With heavy gusts and shifting winds, a dense fog enveloped the ship. In the morning, more reefs were added due to the thick fog. Despite the challenging weather, Captain Shuffles managed the ship skillfully. Breakfast was served in two shifts, with rebels excluded from the main tables. Served cold rations, the rebels grumbled, feeling the pressure to give in.|"6. How did the runaways feel as night fell?

Wilton, a rebel, was fearful of the boatswain due to a past incident involving a rebellious boy. The rebels reluctantly ate the salty, unappetizing food provided, feeling thirsty and desperate. Raymond sought water, finding none, and attempted to access it by any means necessary. The rebels, feeling uncomfortable and nervous from thirst, tried to stealthily obtain water, but were unsuccessful. At mealtime, they were served corned beef and hard bread without water, causing further discomfort. Raymond's desperate attempt to enter the kitchen led to his confinement by the boatswain. The ship sailed through fog, approaching the English coast. Meanwhile, the rebels, enduring misery and thirst, contemplated ways to secure water as they awaited a chance to join their shipmates on deck.|"1.

The crew, led by Lindsley and Raymond, were called on deck. Raymond, swayed by his friend's reasoning, decided to abandon the rebels' cause due to their selfish actions. The ship altered course towards Ushant, an island near France, as the wind shifted.

Paul led the Grand Protectress to the area where the head steward was providing the Raymond party with more water. The boys were very thirsty and had clearly suffered due to lack of water. Mr. Lowington had instructed that they should be given water frequently until they were satisfied as they had returned to their duties. It was believed that they had already been punished severely, not just by their thirst but also by the embarrassment of their failed plan. The principal intervened, stating that he wouldn't entertain their complaints and urged them to continue until they were content. The party, puzzled by the treatment, walked to the ship's weather-rail. The principal explained the badges worn by others, hinting at their secret meanings. Grace and Paul explained the initiation process and the motto of their group. Grace corrected Paul's slang, and they discussed the ship's course and the continuation of their journey. The conversation continued until the starboard watch was called for supper, and Raymond realized they had been fooled. The hungry delinquents were served supper, and those without ribbons were not allowed to eat.

The group of runaways sat down for supper with only salt beef and hard bread, no tea or water. The food didn't please them, and they refused to eat it. They were extremely thirsty as they had already finished their water supply due to the salty breakfast. Despite being thirsty, they weren't in dire need yet. The unavailability of water made them crave it more. They couldn't eat the salt meat, finding it repulsive. The hard bread was dry and hard to eat. Feeling neglected and disregarded, they debated their situation. Howe, feeling the desperation, suggested taking action against hunger and thirst, even if it meant risking their lives. Little, usually resourceful, surprisingly advised surrendering rather than enduring further suffering. Howe, frustrated, expressed his desire to resist and not give in to their current plight.|"1.

The swift change in the second teacher's notes is because the headmaster entered the steerage when the conversation between the two escapees paused. Perth and Herman were at the back of the group and under Mr. Lowington's watchful eye as he left the main cabin. Mr. Lowington might have found it odd for Perth and Herman to be taking notes so diligently, or he might have quickly grasped their activity. When the door opened, Herman sneakily stashed the sheet he was writing on into his pocket. Perth had written on one page and started on a second. He discreetly slid the first sheet into the atlas when his companion finished reading it. Mr. Lowington stopped near Gangway B. Perth folded the sheet to hide any objectionable content from the principal's view. Mr. Lowington wasn't entirely pleased with Perth's behavior and took the paper from the atlas. This action caused a stir among the boys. Mr. Mapps paused until the commotion settled. Mr. Lowington wasn't impressed with Perth's note-taking and suggested he sit closer to the professor. Perth moved as directed. Mr. Mapps resumed the lecture, but Perth was preoccupied with his predicament. Despite the interruption, most students were engrossed in the professor's insights about Germany.|"1. Why did Mr. Lowington stop near Gangway B?

Two days were dedicated to reaching the Rhine, with the initial part of the trip crossing a flat, well-cultivated plain. As the journey progressed, the road inclined, entering a region known as _Himmelreich_, or Heaven, in contrast to the _Höllenthal_, or Valley of Hell, which lay ahead.

The group returned to their hotel and decided to dine at the _table d'hôte_ with other guests, despite their usual aristocratic dining time of six o'clock. After dinner, they hurried to the train station and headed to Ulm. Dr. Winstock, Paul, and the Arbuckles found themselves in a train compartment with one less person as Captain Shuffles joined another group, much to Sir William's dismay.

The _Pfalz_ and Caub town on the right were checkpoints where vessels paid a toll to navigate the river, a tax collected until a few years back by the Duke of Nassau. The toll-house was the _Pfalz_. In medieval times, there were thirty-two toll stations on the river. Schönberg Castle, on the left, got its name from the occupant with seven flirtatious daughters who were turned into rocks for rejecting suitors. Passing Oberwesel and the Seven Sisters, the river had whirlpools and rapids, now removed. The Lurlei precipice on the right has an echo that responds intelligently and sometimes mischievously. St. Goar and St. Goarhausen face each other, with Rheinfels Castle, the most extensive ruin, on the left bank. Boppart, an ancient Roman settlement, marks the widening of the river between the mountains. Marksburg Castle resembles one at Baden-Baden, offering eerie dungeons and galleries. The Rhine's passage through the mountains created the gorge. The Königstuhl was where emperors were elected and dethroned.|"1. What was the toll-house known as in the medieval times?

Before night, the original order on board both ships was restored, and once more the escapees mixed with the loyal ones. Each group had a tale to share, and the wonders of the stunning Rhine River were vividly described by the travelers. The recounting of the adventurers' escapades was envy-inducing to the others, who had little to speak of beyond their sea experiences, except for the Genoa harbor. It was regrettable to admit they had sailed the Mediterranean without stepping ashore. Those who adhered to their duties could truly appreciate the joys of their journey, especially after comparing it to that of the escapees. Only a handful of students disembarked, and those on duty; and at noon the day after the Josephine's arrival, the fleet set sail homeward. The usual ship routine resumed, blending classroom studies with ship duties. Following a single storm, both ships anchored in Brockway harbor after a month-long voyage. The runaways behaved reasonably well during the trip, learning that rebellion and disobedience led to neither safety nor satisfaction. While they were not entirely reformed, they were controlled and kept from a harmful life on land during the cruise. Some students, including Shuffles and Pelham, were redirected from their misguided paths, though their specific transformations were not detailed. The voyage had positive moral outcomes, with the ship's discipline curbing the boys' inclinations toward vice. Intellectually, the cruise was highly successful, with students making significant academic advancements|"1. What was the main topic of conversation among the travelers on board the ships?
