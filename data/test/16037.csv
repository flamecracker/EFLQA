The famous Borgia Pope, Alexander VI, has been accused of dividing the American continent between Spain and Portugal, but this accusation is unjust. The grant he made only applied to lands that had been discovered or might be discovered, which were believed to be parts of India. Other European countries like England and France had little interest or knowledge of Columbus' discovery at that time. John Cabot, a Venetian who settled in Bristol, received a patent in 1496 to sail to the New World with his sons. Sebastian Cabot, his son, was also involved in this expedition. The details of Sebastian Cabot's voyage are not as well-documented as Columbus', but he discovered Newfoundland in 1497. This marked the first English voyage to the New World. The reception of Columbus in Spain differed greatly from the more business-like approach taken by England towards American exploration.|"1.

In 1497, the Cabots discovered North America, preceding Columbus' discovery of the West Indies in 1492. The Venetian-born Sebastian Cabot, as a child, sailed to England with his parents, who were Venetian merchants seeking trade opportunities. Sebastian funded two ships in England and set sail with 300 men towards the North Pole, encountering vast ice masses and nearly continuous daylight in July. Forced to change course due to the ice, he explored westward, reaching lands free of ice. Traveling south, he discovered lands near the latitude of Fretum Herculeum, equating with Cuba. He named the discovered lands Baccallaos, encountering gentle westward currents. Sebastian noted abundant fish, resembling tunas, naming the region after them. The waters' continuous flow between the unknown lands led him to theorize about the Earth's dynamics, debunking myths of sea swallowing and regurgitation.|"1.

The creatures were tied up and had their mouths bound. We were cautious as we thought they might be poisonous. This land was teeming with wildlife, unlike anything we had seen before.

In the following year, Cartier embarked on another expedition with three ships. After confessing and receiving communion in the church of St. Malo, the explorers set sail on Whit Sunday. Among them was Claudius de Pont-Briand, the cup-bearer to the Dauphin. Once again, the indigenous people welcomed the French warmly as they safely landed at Quebec. Cartier left his sailors to establish a fortified camp while he, along with his men-at-arms and two Indian captives from the previous year, ventured to explore the upper banks of the St. Lawrence River towards the great Indian city of Hochelaga. Despite the outward friendliness of the Indians, they attempted to dissuade Cartier from his journey, even resorting to theatrics with canoes carrying figures resembling demons. However, Cartier stood firm in his resolve, asserting his faith in Christ over their warnings. The journey continued, and after a fortnight, they reached the majestic natural citadel of Hochelaga. The French were received hospitably and with reverence, suggesting they were seen as more than mortal beings. The villagers even brought their sick to be healed by the French.

Despite the outward friendliness of the Indians, they attempted to dissuade Cartier from his journey, even resorting to theatrics with canoes carrying figures resembling demons. However, Cartier stood firm in his resolve, asserting his faith in Christ over their warnings. The journey continued, and after a fortnight, they reached the majestic natural citadel of Hochelaga. The French were received hospitably and with reverence, suggesting they were seen as more than mortal beings. The villagers even brought their sick to be healed by the French.

In the past, Jacques Cartier sailed from Canada, leaving Roberval behind. The first encounter with the natives was nerve-wracking due to uncertainties caused by Donnacona's passing. Fortunately, the chief who received the news was Donnacona's successor and showed no discontent. The French settled back in Quebec, sending two ships to France to report their safe arrival. Cartier and two boats explored the river above Hochelaga. Tensions rose between the settlers and the Indians after Donnacona's death, prompting Cartier to abandon the colony. On his way back to France, Cartier briefly stopped in Newfoundland, where he avoided Roberval and sailed away. Roberval continued to Quebec, where he built a communal dwelling but faced challenges due to inadequate supplies, scurvy, and harsh discipline. The colony's fate remains unknown, with Roberval meeting a violent end in Paris. The colony was not revived, leaving the St. Lawrence area deserted for over fifty years.|"1.

On the first of August, we explored lands to the North and Northeast, resembling mountains, with low lands in between holding woods and rivers. We ventured around these lands, still heading Northwest, seeking a potential gulf or passage until the fifth of the month. The distance between these lands is approximately fifteen leagues. The middle point between them lies at 50 degrees and a third in latitude. Despite facing great winds and opposing tides, we pushed five miles further. Upon reaching this point, we observed land on both sides, signaling the beginning of a spread-out area. However, the raging tide forced us to retreat, leaving some men to guard the boats while a smaller group explored the Cape. This exploration led us to decide to head back home due to worsening weather conditions and the uncertainty of what lay ahead.|"1. What direction were the explorers heading on the first of August?

In 1513, Balboa, a Spanish explorer, crossed the continental backbone at Darien and planted the Spanish flag near the Pacific Ocean. Spanish explorers eagerly searched the Gulf of Mexico's western coast for a passage through. Cortez, after conquering Mexico, ventured west and northwest in pursuit of a strait mentioned by Montezuma. Despite Montezuma's limited knowledge of North American geography, he shared tales of riches and waterways beyond the horizon. Spanish explorers, driven by myths and desires for gold and glory, embarked on costly expeditions. In 1528, Narvaez led a failed expedition to Florida, while Cabeza de Vaca's group endured eight years of hardship wandering across the Southwest.

After spending two days resting, we decided to search for maize. We chose not to follow the path to where the cattle are, as it was north and a longer route. We believed that heading west would lead us to what we sought. We journeyed until we reached the South Sea. Despite the fear of hunger during the seventeen-day journey, we persevered. We survived on deer-suet, saving it for such times. Eventually, we encountered a group of people who ate powdered straw for part of the year, and we had to do the same until we reached a place with an abundance of maize. The locals generously provided us with food and supplies, including maize, beans, and cotton shawls. Grateful, we loaded our guides with gifts and continued our journey through diverse lands, encountering different languages and customs.|"1.

After spending two days resting, we decided to search for maize. We chose not to follow the path to where the cattle are, as it was north and a longer route. We believed that heading west would lead us to what we sought. We journeyed until we reached the South Sea. Despite the fear of hunger during the seventeen-day journey, we persevered. We survived on deer-suet, saving it for such times. Eventually, we encountered a group of people who ate powdered straw for part of the year, and we had to do the same until we reached a place with an abundance of maize. The locals generously provided us with food and supplies, including maize, beans, and cotton shawls. Grateful, we loaded our guides with gifts and continued our journey through diverse lands, encountering different languages and customs.|"3.

In the lands we traveled, we made peace with the people we met, showing them signs to convey that there is a God in heaven who created the earth and sky. We worshiped Him and followed His commandments for our well-being. If they followed our ways, we believed they would prosper. The locals, quick to understand, mimicked our gestures towards the sky at sunrise and sunset. They were generous, offering us deer hearts and guiding us to Pueblo de los Corazones. They lived off fish, rushes, and straw powder, without canoes. The women wore grass and straw for clothing. The land was abundant, with maize and beans planted thrice a year. The deer were large, and they had deadly poison from a tree. We encountered rain and swollen rivers, delaying our journey. The locals believed men with beards like us had come from heaven, bringing weapons. This news renewed our hope of finding fellow Christians. We assured the natives we sought to protect these people from harm.|"1. What signs did the travelers show to convey the existence of God to the locals?

We sent messengers to call others to join us. The journey was perilous, with traces of gold and metals along the way. Eventually, we encountered Christians, bringing relief and gratitude for our escape from captivity.

On the fifth morning, the wind calmed, and the flood came. We floated our ship into five fathoms of water and sent a boat to explore the bay. Men went ashore and encountered many native people who offered tobacco. They ventured into the woods and found impressive oak trees and currants. The locals had copper tobacco pipes and wore copper adornments. That night, caution prevailed. The next day, our men discovered a pleasant river to the north and a narrow river between two islands. They described the land as beautiful with grass, flowers, and sweet-smelling trees. On the tenth, we sailed to find varying depths, anchoring in soft ground. The eleventh was hot, and we found a good harbor, but natives visited cautiously. The twelfth was hot, and we anchored in the river, fending off a potential betrayal. The thirteenth saw more oyster trade with locals, and we anchored for the night.|"1. What did the men encounter when they went ashore in the bay?

Before Henry Hudson came to America, he explored Greenland and Spitzbergen, seeking passages from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In 1609, he discovered New York's harbor and the river named after him. The following year, he ventured into Hudson Bay, where he spent the winter. However, when he planned to return home in June, his crew mutinied, leaving Hudson and eight others adrift in a small boat. They were never seen again. As we traveled to Lake St. Peter, we marveled at the pleasant surroundings, crossing the lake with ease. The area was abundant with rivers and islands, teeming with wildlife and fish. The journey continued to the River of the Iroquois, where we were welcomed by the natives with food and provisions. Despite some disagreements among the natives, we pressed on, encountering more islands, game, and beavers along the way. The journey was filled with discoveries of beautiful landscapes, fruit trees, and mountains inhabited by the Iroquois.|"1. What did Henry Hudson discover in 1609?

The French allies swiftly retreated after their victory, reaching the Richelieu River where they parted ways. The Hurons and Algonquins headed towards the Ottawa River, each taking prisoners for future torment. Before parting, they invited Champlain to visit their villages and assist in future battles, an offer he accepted. Left with the Montagnais, they had a scare when one dreamt of Iroquois approaching, prompting them to flee to the islands above Lake St. Peter. After a tense night, they regained courage, journeyed to Quebec, and later Tadousac with Champlain. The women at Tadousac celebrated by swimming naked to the canoes, adorning themselves with the heads of fallen Iroquois. Champlain received a head and arms as tokens of gratitude for his aid.

The mouth of the Mesconsin [Wisconsin] is around 42-1/2 N. latitude. Here we are on the famous river, the Mississippi. The river starts in lakes up north. It begins narrow at the Mesconsin's mouth, flowing south until it meets tall hills. The river is slow due to its depth, with nineteen fathoms of water. Further on, it widens to almost three-quarters of a league and stays consistent. As we move south, the landscape changes, with fewer woods and mountains. The islands are lush with trees, but animals like roebucks, buffaloes, and swans are scarce. We encountered huge fish that we mistook for trees at first. There was also a strange creature that resembled a tiger with a sharp nose and a long beard. We caught sturgeons and unique fish with peculiar features. As we reached 41° 28', turkeys and Pisikious, similar to wild buffaloes, replaced other animals. We continued our journey, navigating the river cautiously, facing wild beasts and birds. Our travels led us to the Pekitanoni [Missouri] river, where we saw painted rocks with frightening monsters that even the bravest Indians feared. The Pekitanoni's water was too muddy to drink, and its rapid flow made navigation treacherous. This river joins the Mississippi and is lined with Indian villages.
