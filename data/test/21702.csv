Suddenly, Graddy lunged with the knife, but Billy's father, Stephen Gaff, struck Graddy down. Gaff then decided to let Graddy rest, take the oars, and allow Billy to sleep. Gaff rowed silently, pondering his past mistakes and the danger they faced. He thought of his family back home, unaware of their fate. Gaff felt the agony of thirst creeping in and feared Graddy's intent. Despite contemplating salvation, his thoughts always returned to the imminent danger aboard the boat. He hoped his family would find peace, unaware of the peril he and Billy faced.|"4. What did Gaff decide to do after striking Graddy down?

Dear reader, the events described here are not mere fiction but reflect the harsh reality faced by sailors at sea during stormy seasons. Many heart-wrenching scenes of suffering and death occur unnoticed by us humans, known only to the Omniscient. Occasionally, survivors offer glimpses into these tragedies, urging us to contemplate the unseen struggles of those who brave the vast waters. As Christians, we should empathize with those who risk their lives at sea. Consider this: mere contemplation without action is futile and condemnable. In this tale, Gaff, a sailor, unable to read or write, pens a letter to his wife using great effort. He dispatches it in a bottle, praying for its safe journey. Amidst rising winds, a confrontation ensues in the boat, threatening their safety. Billy, fearing the boat may capsize, frantically bails out water while the men grapple in a life-and-death struggle.|"1. What is the main idea of the passage?

The strong wind and high waves made it challenging to keep the boat afloat. The storm brought heavy rain, which they used to quench their thirst. As hunger set in, they rationed their food, only making them hungrier. They had to run before the wind, with a makeshift sail to help. In the darkness, steering was difficult, relying more on feeling than sight. Gaff directed Billy to steer while he and Graddy bailed water. To protect the boat, Gaff threw sails and spars overboard, creating a barrier against the waves. The next day, the sun shone, and Graddy's behavior became erratic, alarming the others. As night fell, a tense confrontation unfolded between Gaff and the now-maniacal Graddy, leading to a dangerous struggle on the boat.|"1.

Billy quickly rose and attempted to break free from his father's grasp, but it was as futile as a rabbit trying to escape a boa's coil. Desperate, he snatched the tiller and struck the madman repeatedly, to no avail. As panic set in, Billy landed a final forceful blow behind the man's ear, causing him to collapse. Frantically, Billy cared for his father, fearing the madman's recovery. Throughout the night, they struggled to restrain the maniac as the storm raged outside. At dawn, the dying man made a final, terrifying move, plunging into the sea.

Shortly after passing the Cape, the bottle drifted near the Falkland Islands, known for their harsh landscape fitting for a penal colony. Sea-lions, penguins, and seals thrived there, almost guarding the area from escapees. A sea-lion saved the bottle from destruction by pushing it back to sea during a storm near the cliffs. The bottle then got stuck in a Sargasso sea, a stagnant area full of seaweed, near the Falklands for months until a hurricane freed it. The bottle caught a current towards Africa, narrowly avoiding another Sargasso sea. Eventually, it reached the Cape of Good Hope, facing turbulent weather. Conflicting currents near Mozambique almost delayed the bottle's journey, but a typhoon redirected it northward towards the equator. The bottle narrowly missed landing in India and continued its slow voyage parallel to the African coast.|"1. What saved the bottle from destruction during a storm near the Falkland Islands?

Upon reaching the hot equator region, our small boat faced challenges from conflicting currents, embarking on deep-sea journeys alongside denser, cooler currents. Initially, it seemed the boat might return to its starting point near South America's east coast. However, fate intervened, propelling the vessel into the westward equatorial current from the Gulf of Guinea. Passing South America's north-west corner, skirting the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, navigating the West Indies, and crossing the Caribbean Sea, the boat eventually reached the Gulf of Mexico. Here, it joined the famous Gulf Stream, continuing its voyage until it washed ashore in western Ireland. The bottle's journey, guided by ocean currents, ended in a mysterious arrival, sparking curiosity and anticipation among the locals.|"1.

Gaff had been trying to create a light by striking his knife against flint. After a few minutes, he succeeded and handed his son the smoking material. His son, Billy, blew on it until a flame appeared. They used it to start a fire. The Bu'ster, another character, then searched for a spit to cook some food. He joked about how a pig named Mister Grumpy would have yelled if he were alive. Just then, a small pig ran into the cave and sat by the fire to warm itself. Billy had once caught this pig in a unique way while hunting. While returning home, he shot an arrow at a group of pigs, hitting one in the ear. He chased and caught it, but the mother pig followed. Billy barely escaped by running over loose stones. Later, when Billy was taking down a flag, he spotted a sail near the land. He shouted for Gaff, who heard and rushed to see the approaching ship.|"1. What did Gaff use to create a light in the cave?
