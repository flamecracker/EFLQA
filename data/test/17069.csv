"""I agree,"" I exclaimed enthusiastically. Henrietta and I both clapped our hands simultaneously. This gesture restored Rupert's confidence, and he nodded before continuing the lecture. We learned that a drowned person should be turned face down to drain the water from their mouth and ears. Their wet clothes must be removed, and they should be dried and warmed promptly, then placed in a comfortable position with the head slightly elevated. These instructions seemed doable. Henrietta had experience dressing and undressing dolls, while I imagined myself filling a hot-water bottle with a serious air. However, the steps for ""restoring breathing"" troubled us. Despite Henrietta practicing on me, mimicking the process of ""inspiration"" and ""expiration,"" it ended in laughter. Rupert's lectures on handling emergencies were engaging. We simulated scenarios like rescuing a pretend cripple from a fire and immobilizing a broken leg on Baby Cecil. Though Baby Cecil was uncooperative, we learned valuable lessons through play. Rupert's lectures focused on daytime emergencies, leaving me hoping for guidance on handling nighttime fears like robbers or ghosts. Rupert found us good students, despite occasional disagreements with Henrietta. She was independent-minded, leading to clashes with Rupert. Henrietta's tomboyish ways earned her the nickname ""Monkey,"" causing playful mischief. Her dark hair often fell out of place, much to Rupert's chagrin."|"1.

I regretted not being able to casually mention to my new friends that I was related to a peer who lived in the Castle due to strict instructions. The Castle was a popular spot, and my peers enjoyed visiting to see the pictures of my ancestors, a privilege I did not have as our cousin never invited us. The next day at school, I failed to realize that Weston and Johnson were mocking me. Despite warnings, I made a fool of myself. I had a mix of excitement and anxiety about school, but Rupert's exaggerated tales made me cautious. When Rupert fell ill, I went to school alone and was embarrassed when Weston mimicked me, causing laughter among the boys. It was a valuable lesson on the dangers of vanity and the importance of humility and discretion in sharing personal information.|"1.

Mrs. Johnson once shared a tale about Dartmouth harbor with me. She mentioned an old iron chain that spanned the harbor's mouth for defense. Fred, later, spun a fascinating yarn about this chain. He described it as crafted from silver, with each link valued at twenty pounds. At sunset, a lion supposedly guarded the chain's lock, preventing the French from entry. Fred even narrated a daring encounter between his grandfather and the lion, adding exotic elements from foreign lands. These imaginative tales, blending reality with fiction, painted vivid pictures of sea adventures, encounters with sea people, and the wonders of the world. Fred's slow, deliberate storytelling style, set against the backdrop of the wharf and canal boats, added an air of mystery and excitement to his narratives.|"1.

"Mr. Howe's lectures annoyed me, and I was set on avoiding his supervision to go to sea. However, poor Fred was overwhelmed. ""I wish we were back home safe,"" he nearly cried when I approached him. Feeling hungry, I decided to order dinner. When the woman kindly asked if she could assist us before bed, I requested a budget-friendly meal. She swiftly returned with bread and herrings. The beer was a pleasant surprise. The room smelled odd, but the aroma of the food masked it. Fred cheered up, and we chatted with Mr. Rowe's old friend. I inquired about the city and learned about boats and steamers. Mr. Smith shared his seafaring experiences, unlike Mr. Rowe, who discouraged me from sailing. We retired to a cramped, smelly room, but with hopes for a safe night and plans to sail back with Mr. Rowe."|"1. What did the speaker order for dinner in the text passage?

Mr. Rowe admired their selflessness. Later, our cousin visited and took us to the Castle for three months. He sent Rupert abroad for treatment and to a better school.

Fred Johnson and I used to be close friends, especially after our barge journey, but things changed. The bond we shared over his captivating tales of the captain seemed to fade.

During a visit to Dartmouth, he marveled at the town's charm, and we discussed past adventures, including the lion and the silver chain.

The children, who are younger than Philip and me, often squabbled among themselves. Despite our efforts to keep them in line, they often gave in to their tempers. Ill-temper can cause much misery, leading to anger, hurt pride, and regret. Good-tempered individuals can unintentionally provoke those with hot tempers. It is wise to avoid unnecessary provocation and show patience during moments of anger. However, principles should not be compromised, and unjust attacks should be defended when calm. It is unwise to yield to ill-tempered individuals constantly. Even though Mrs. Rampant yields to Mr. Rampant, it is not beneficial in the long run. It is essential to practice self-control and gratitude for God's forbearance towards us.

It is unwise to yield to ill-tempered individuals constantly. Even though Mrs. Rampant yields to Mr. Rampant, it is not beneficial in the long run. It is essential to practice self-control and gratitude for God's forbearance towards us. Reflecting on past actions can lead to gratitude for avoiding severe consequences due to uncontrolled anger.|"6. What is essential to practice, according to the passage?
A) Impulsiveness
B) Gratitude for avoiding consequences of anger
C) Yielding to unjust attacks
D) Uncontrolled anger
E) Provocation"|B) Gratitude for avoiding consequences of anger**|B
At dinner time, I hastily concealed the hatchet as Philip fell silent. Upon my return to work, I discovered my meticulously crafted moss-house walls destroyed, strewn across the garden.

My aunt Isobel overestimated her strength. She struggled silently, then left, leaning on my knick-knack table, a rare sight. Mr. Rampant, a man of unchecked temper, was the talk of the servants.

The fear of sudden apoplexy, a family trait, loomed each communion. I now feel Mr. Rampant should have attended, seeking forgiveness and grace.

I wasn't supposed to write a play. We didn't bother to learn specific roles. We usually picked a story from Grimm's Fairy Tales or the Arabian Nights and set up scenes. Each of us had a plan, and our roles were assigned. Then, we acted out the dialogue like a charade. We were used to performing together and trusted each other. Only Alice's talent surprised us. By the time Philip returned, I had outlined the plot. He brought a box of props, exciting the little ones. Philip was enthusiastic about our play, especially since he was to play the dragon! When he committed to something, he put in the effort. He even wanted to paint a new forest scene. Despite my attempts to dissuade him, he insisted.

And don't worry about Clinton, I'll sort it out. You and Alice always ignored him, and that bothered me; but I am disappointed in him.

I was filled with certainty that they would succeed. Beyond the relief of things falling into place and the excitement of upcoming fun, I felt a deeper sense of peace. In my past religious encounters, I had never experienced this level of triumph and gratitude. Circumstances, not just self-control, had resolved my previous conflicts; I had never truly faced a battle and emerged victorious over my weaknesses. But now, despite my imperfections, I had fought and won. Thanks to Philip's generosity, I had triumphed. From then on, my soul would confront challenges with the confidence of victory, knowing that I had fought, prevailed, and not been defeated. Boys don't always handle situations well. Philip blushed, and I invited Aunt Isobel to the nursery, where she proved to be invaluable. We quickly restored order to the theater with Philip fixing the scene and Bobby, with his inventive ideas, contributing to the play. Everyone pitched in to make things right, even Charles offering his white plume in the end. The unexpected reluctance of the new Prince to go on stage surprised us all.|"1.

It has been quite some time since the lively plays of Twelfth Night. The Dragon, a character long dissolved into mere scales, no longer graces us with impromptu performances. The brief fame from a tragic railroad incident near our small station has also faded. Yet, that event sealed our commitment to better ways, a promise we've kept. It was on the very spot where I once struggled to forgive Philip that news of his near-death reached me. Philip claims my actions saved him, and it softened his demeanor towards me. The memory of nearly losing him motivates me to show kindness. We've been labeled a family with a quick temper by some, but we find strength in what endures. Despite the challenges, we once wished for a fairy godmother to help us create our ideal homes, free from disruptions.|"1.

In Our Field, we had a variety of shops where I sold all sorts of things. Sometimes I was a moss-merchant by the brook, selling ten different kinds of moss. Other times, I turned into a jeweler offering daisy-chains, pebbles, and coral sets. I also ran a provisions shop with earth-nuts and mallow-cheeses. One of my favorites was the flower-shop where I sold nosegays and wreaths. Richard and Sandy, using money made of elder-pith, bought items from my shops. We played games like castles and houses, and even pretended to go to the seaside by the brook. That summer, we were happy, except for worrying about Perronet's tax-money, which we kept spending. Eventually, we heard about a flower-show with prizes, and I decided to enter with a collection of flowers from Our Field.|"1. What did the speaker sell as a moss-merchant by the brook in Our Field?
