Mary was experiencing some wonderful things at Misselthwaite Manor. She had connected with a robin, felt the wind warm her blood, experienced a healthy hunger, and learned to empathize with others. As she listened to the wind one day, she heard a strange sound that seemed like a child crying. The sound was inside the house, not outside. Suddenly, a door downstairs opened, causing a rush of air that blew open the room's door, extinguishing the light. The crying sound grew louder as a distant door slammed shut. Martha, Mary's companion, quickly closed the door and locked it. Martha shared stories about her family, including her brother Dickon, who rescued animals.

One peculiar morning, a little girl found herself exploring a vast, empty house all alone. As she roamed through the corridors and rooms, she felt as though she was the only one who had ever been there. The rooms were filled with old pictures, tapestries, and unique furniture. In a room with embroidered velvet hangings, she discovered a cabinet holding a collection of miniature ivory elephants. Fascinated, she played with them for a while before carefully arranging them back in the cabinet. While she had seen no signs of life in the house, she encountered a little gray mouse and her six babies nesting in a cushion. Tired from her explorations, she made her way back, occasionally getting lost in the maze-like corridors. As she stood pondering her location, a faint cry interrupted the silence, a sound that hinted at another presence in the mysterious house.|"1.

The remarkable scientific revelations I aim to uncover will revolve around Magic. Magic remains a profound enigma known to only a select few, hidden in ancient tomes and partially understood by Mary due to her upbringing in India among fakirs. I suspect Dickon possesses a latent grasp of Magic, evident in his ability to captivate animals and people. Magic, I believe, permeates everything, waiting for us to harness its power like we do with electricity and steam. When Mary unearthed this garden, it appeared lifeless, yet nature began to flourish miraculously. This phenomenon piqued my scientific curiosity. I am resolved to adopt a scientific mindset, always questioning and seeking answers. Magic is the force behind the growth of plants, the flight of birds, and the vitality in all living beings. It surrounds us, waiting to be embraced. Let us embark on this experiment together, invoking Magic to empower us and instill strength.|"1.
