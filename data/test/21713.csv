While the crew of the _Evening Star_ chatted, a light breeze picked up, and Billy noticed the admiral's boat sailing to the east into the wind. As the breeze reached the fleet, all the boats followed the same path, creating a line of nearly two hundred boats trailing behind the admiral. The smooth sea was now rippled with indigo waves. The fleet was heading to a fishing area before nightfall, aiming to turn back and sail with the wind at night, dragging their nets across the fish-rich banks. Night fishing is preferred due to fish possibly not seeing the nets well or being more likely to sleep at night. Around ten o'clock, the admiral signaled a stop, and the crew prepared to lower the massive fishing net into the twenty-five-fathom deep sea. The crew worked with vigor under the bright moon and lantern light, carefully maneuvering the heavy net and gear. Night fishing trips can be quite profitable, ranging from 10 to 27 pounds for a single night and up to 280 pounds for an eight-week trip.|"1.

At this point, the crew had successfully secured the heavy beam to the vessel's side, pulled in most of the net, and hoisted the bag filled with a variety of fish and debris above the surface.

Fear not, dear reader, we do not plan to give you a sermon with a nautical theme. Our goal is to provide you with a genuine glimpse of life on the North Sea as we have observed it. Just as it would be a mistake to exclude the darkest shadows from a painting, it would be wrong to leave out the brightest highlights, even if you may not recognize them as such. The preacher's talk was brief, but his passion was evident. The audience reacted differently, with most showing deep sympathy, listening intently. Some initially wore cynical expressions but softened as the preacher discussed spiritual matters. On deck, Gunter and his companions were intrigued by the sermon and listened attentively. Afterward, hymns were sung, prayers were said, and advice was given, including a warning about the dangers of excessive drinking. The skipper emphasized the importance of avoiding the slippery slope of alcoholism and encouraged the young men to sign a temperance pledge. He explained that true temperance comes from trusting in a higher power and seeking help when faced with temptation.|"1. What is the preacher's main message to the audience?
