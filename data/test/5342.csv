The Story Girl placed violets on her mother's grave and read the verse inscribed there, moving us all with its beauty and poignancy. The church's interior matched its old-fashioned exterior, with square pews and a wine-glass pulpit. Uncle Alec's pew was near the pulpit, at the top of the church.|"5.

Peter and the Story Girl soon joined us. Peter, despite a patch on his trousers, looked presentable with his rosy face, neatly combed black curls, and a well-tied bow.

Felicity offered him a cent, but Dan lent him one, to be repaid the next week.

Peter's arrival at church went unnoticed, despite our anticipation. The atmosphere was serene, with dim lighting and a quiet hush. The sky outside displayed a blend of purple, gold, and silvery green hues, adorned with rosy clouds above the elms. During the service, Felicity frowned at Peter for talking, and the Story Girl nudged him to maintain decorum. Peter complied, sitting upright and attentive. However, a mishap occurred during the collection when Peter burst into laughter after recalling a humorous story. The congregation turned to look at our pew, causing embarrassment all around. Despite the tension, Felicity explained that the Story Girl's tales prompted her laughter, citing specific comical anecdotes involving church members.

We all burst into laughter right there, much to Mrs. Abraham Ward's dismay, who saw us as she passed by. She later scolded Aunt Janet, saying we had behaved improperly on the way home from church. We felt embarrassed because we knew that Sundays should be spent with decency and order. Despite feeling ashamed, even Felicity couldn't help but laugh. Surprisingly, Felicity wasn't as upset with Peter as expected. She walked alongside him and let him carry her Bible, engaging in a friendly conversation. Peter expressed his interest in continuing to attend church, finding sermons and singing enjoyable. He pondered whether to be a Presbyterian or a Methodist, considering asking the ministers for advice. Felicity, a Presbyterian, couldn't explain the differences between the two but was content with her choice.

We chose not to inform the adults of our mission, fearing their disapproval. Peg Bowen's house was almost a mile away, past the swamp and up a wooded hill.

One Sunday afternoon, we played a game of fruit-basket using Bible characters' names. Felix suggested it to make it okay to play on Sundays. We had a merry time calling out names like Lazarus and Martha. Peter wanted to stick to his name but we insisted he choose another to be fair. Peter chose Nebuchadnezzar, which was hard to say quickly. Suddenly, Uncle Alec and Aunt Janet interrupted us. The Story Girl then proposed a sermon competition. Each boy would preach, and the best sermon would win a prize. I decided to preach about missions, adding dramatic verses to make an impact. I wrote my sermon with red “thump” marks for emphasis, feeling proud. I practiced it in the granary, even though I doubted Peter's ability to beat me.|"3.

With nervousness, I climbed the pulpit steps, and our session began with songs and readings, skipping prayers. We collected funds for missions, solemnly led by Dan.

For two days, we were too occupied to share or hear stories. Only at dusk did we journey with the Story Girl into the realms of myth and folklore. She unraveled tales of gods and goddesses, nymphs and satyrs, weaving a tapestry of wonder. The Golden Age seemed to come alive in our orchards and woods. But on the third day, the Story Girl arrived with a pale face, bearing grim news of Peter's illness. The possibility of his death shook us to the core. We sought solace in the somber woods, grappling with the harsh reality. As tears flowed, Felicity lamented her past unkindness towards Peter. The Story Girl, though visibly distressed, remained composed, a pillar of strength in our time of sorrow.|"1. What did the Story Girl do at dusk?

"Dear Peter,

We are all relieved to hear that you are recovering. It was quite frightening when we learned of your illness. We all think highly of you and have been saying kind things about you. I promised that if you improved, I would share these thoughts with you. It's easier for me to write them down rather than say them face to face. We believe you are intelligent, polite, helpful, hardworking, and a true gentleman.

Aunt Olivia suggested we send you this letter to lift your spirits. I plan to bake some treats for you now that the doctor says you can enjoy them. I'll even send over my special rosebud plate for you to use, but remember, it's on loan. I treasure it dearly. Take care not to catch a cold as you recover. We hope the measles won't spread to the rest of us. The Story Girl continues to entertain us with her witty remarks, while Felix claims he's losing weight despite indulging in plenty of apples. Beverley is thrilled to have grown half an inch since July, and Cecily has decided to stop curling her hair. Sara Ray is feeling lonely, and Judy mentioned she cries often. I feel sorry for her but also grateful not to be in her shoes. Sara will be writing to you too, and I hope you'll share her letter with me. Remember to take some Mexican Tea as it is known for its blood-purifying properties.

"Dear Peter,

We are all relieved to hear that you are recovering. It was quite frightening when we learned of your illness. We all think highly of you and have been saying kind things about you. I promised that if you improved, I would share these thoughts with you. It's easier for me to write them down rather than say them face to face. We believe you are intelligent, polite, helpful, hardworking, and a true gentleman.

Aunt Olivia suggested we send you this letter to lift your spirits. I plan to bake some treats for you now that the doctor says you can enjoy them. I'll even send over my special rosebud plate for you to use, but remember, it's on loan. I treasure it dearly. Take care not to catch a cold as you recover. We hope the measles won't spread to the rest of us. The Story Girl continues to entertain us with her witty remarks, while Felix claims he's losing weight despite indulging in plenty of apples. Beverley is thrilled to have grown half an inch since July, and Cecily has decided to stop curling her hair. Sara Ray is feeling lonely, and Judy mentioned she cries often. I feel sorry for her but also grateful not to be in her shoes. Sara will be writing to you too, and I hope you'll share her letter with me. Remember to take some Mexican Tea as it is known for its blood-purifying properties.

Get well soon!

Warm regards,

I am excited to share that I am going to buy a beautiful dark blue dress for the winter. It is much lovelier than Sara Ray's brown one. Sara Ray's mother doesn't have good taste. The Story Girl's father is sending her a new red dress and a red velvet cap from Paris. She adores red. Personally, I find it common. However, Mother said I could get a velvet hood too. Cecily thinks it's not right to wear velvet when it's expensive and the heathen need the gospel. The Story Girl suggested I sign it 'yours affectionately,' but I know better. I am happy you are recovering, Peter. I regret saying mean things about you. I am thinner from picking apples. The girls are well. We miss you and wish you were here. Looking forward to your return.

I will name the southernwood 'appleringie' from now on. Beverley mentioned that's what they call it in Scotland, and I find it more poetic than southernwood. Felicity suggests its proper name is 'Boy's Love,' but I find that silly. Shadows are such lovely things, Peter. The orchard is filled with them right now. Sometimes they are so still, you'd think they were asleep. Then they start laughing and skipping. In the oat field, they are always chasing each other, wild shadows. The orchard shadows are more tame. Everything seems a bit tired from growing, except for the spruces and chrysanthemums in Aunt Olivia's garden. The sunshine is thick, yellow, and lazy, with crickets singing all day. Most birds have gone, and maple leaves have fallen. Let me share a funny story Uncle Alec told last night about Elder Frewen's grandfather mistaking rope reins for livestock to lead a piano home. Everyone laughed except Aunt Janet, who found it disrespectful. And then there was the tale of old Mark Ward making a drunken speech at a church missionary social. Felicity might be wondering why this letter is so long, so I should probably stop. If your mother reads it to you, there may be parts she doesn't understand, but I believe Aunt Jane would.

I'm thankful Peg Bowen didn't catch you, Dan. Maybe she bewitched me that night at her place, and that's why I got the measles. I'm grateful Mr. King will wait to harvest the potatoes until I recover, and I appreciate the Story Girl for convincing him. I think she'll uncover Alice's secret.

I'm grateful for their kindness, even though I'm just a hired boy. We celebrated Peter's return with a picnic in the orchard. Sara Ray rejoined us too, and her happiness was touching.

We set up a table with a worn cloth and decorated it with scarlet geraniums and maple leaves. Felicity prepared delicious treats, including a plum cake with a welcoming message for Peter.
