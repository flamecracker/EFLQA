The ongoing conflict continued as the enraged King seized control of the archbishop's revenues and expelled all his relatives and servants, totaling four hundred individuals. Despite this, Thomas à Becket found support from the Pope and the French King, who provided him with a residence in an abbey. Encouraged by this backing, Becket publicly cursed and excommunicated those who supported the Constitutions of Clarendon during a church service, even mentioning English nobles by name and indirectly alluding to the King of England. The King, upon hearing of this, flew into a furious rage, tearing his clothes and rolling on his bed like a madman.

During the ongoing French war, Lord Vidomar, Viscount of Limoges, discovered a treasure of ancient coins on his land. As a vassal of the King, he sent half of it to the King, who demanded the entire treasure. When the lord refused, the King besieged his castle, threatening to hang all defenders.

The French King, Philip, rejected John's claim to his new title and supported Arthur instead. Philip's actions were not motivated by kindness towards the orphaned Arthur but were driven by his own ambitions to oppose King John. This led to a war between John and the French King over Arthur.

During his imprisonment in the castle, the young prince Arthur gazed sadly out of a small window at the summer sky and birds. Unexpectedly, his uncle, the King, entered with a grim expression.

In history, after the King of England was deemed too young to rule alone, a council gathered in Bristol to revise Magna Charta. Lord Pembroke was appointed as Regent to oversee the country. The next challenge was to remove Prince Louis of France from English territories. Lord Pembroke besieged a castle in Leicestershire held by Prince Louis, who sent a large army in retaliation. Despite being outnumbered, Lord Pembroke cleverly defeated the French forces in Lincoln. The English fleet also triumphed over the French ships near the Thames, ending Prince Louis' ambitions. A treaty was signed, and the English Barons returned to their allegiance. Lord Pembroke, a just ruler, improved laws and settled disputes. Unfortunately, within three years of the young King's rule, Lord Pembroke passed away.

The large crowd cheered once more, and the cheers echoed through the streets. No one remembered Richard the Second as the once beautiful, wise, and good prince. Now, he appeared more pitiful in the Tower of London than the deceased Wat Tyler had been in Smithfield. During the previous reign, the preaching of Wickliffe against the Pope's pride and deceit had caused a stir in England. The new King seemed to oppose Wickliffe's followers, the Lollards, possibly to gain favor with the priests or to deceive Heaven into thinking he was not a usurper. He cruelly introduced the abhorrent practice of burning heretics, a custom from abroad. This King had no rightful claim to the throne; the young Earl of March was the rightful heir. Despite being confined in Windsor Castle, Richard the Second hoped Henry would be a good lord to him. The Parliament decided to keep Richard in a secluded place, signaling his impending demise. The Lords engaged in quarrels and plotted against the King. A conspiracy to kill the King at a tournament was thwarted, leading to the traitors' downfall and Richard's death, likely by the King's orders. Charles of France went mad upon hearing of his daughter's plight in England. Negotiations between France and England resulted in the return of the young Queen to Paris without her fortune, sparking disputes among the French nobles.|"1.

When news of two murders reached Rome, the Pope was furious like never before. He issued a Bull commanding his followers to rise against the murderer and overthrow him. The King, on the other hand, took measures to keep this order out of his realm. In retaliation, he began to close down numerous English monasteries and abbeys.

During this time, the Protestant religion was advancing. Images that people had started to worship were removed from churches. The requirement to confess to priests was now optional. A common prayer book in English was introduced for better understanding. Other improvements were gradually implemented. Cranmer, a moderate man, prevented Protestant clergy from violently attacking the unreformed religion, setting a good example. However, the people faced great distress. Greedy nobles who acquired Church lands were poor landlords. They enclosed vast areas for sheep farming, worsening the general distress. The people, not fully understanding the changes, believed the monks who blamed the reformed religion for their troubles. This led to uprisings, notably in Devonshire and Norfolk. In Devonshire, ten thousand rebels laid siege to Exeter but were defeated. In Norfolk, led by Robert Ket, rebels gathered under the Tree of Reformation, holding courts and debates. Despite warnings, they were eventually defeated by the Earl of Warwick.|"1. What was one improvement introduced during the advancement of the Protestant religion?

Torture, like the rack, was used to extract confessions, but these confessions were often unreliable due to the extreme pain. Plots involving the Jesuits, France, Scotland, and Spain to overthrow Queen Elizabeth were discovered.

In the year of his twenty-fifth age, Baby Charles ascended to the throne as King Charles the First. Unlike his father, he possessed a generally amiable private character and carried himself with gravity and dignity.

The English populace initially welcomed their new Queen, but her disdain for the Protestant faith and the arrival of disagreeable priests quickly soured their sentiments towards her.

During a turbulent time in history, King Charles I found himself in a precarious position where trust was scarce. Despite Oliver Cromwell's belief that the King deserved his rights to enjoy peace, the King's secret hopes for Scottish help led to his downfall. The King's wavering loyalty to his allies and his plotting against them led to his capture and imprisonment at Carisbrooke Castle.

The second civil war, marked by the Parliament's rejection of the King and subsequent execution of Royalist generals, culminated in the army's bold march to London.

The Duke of Monmouth, arriving at Lyme in Dorset, was delayed and found himself behind his friend due to idling. Accompanied by Lord Grey of Werk, an unfortunate nobleman, Monmouth raised his standard in the market-place, denouncing the King as a tyrant and a Popish usurper. Gathering supporters, he marched to Taunton, where Protestant dissenters opposed Catholics. Welcomed with flowers and gifts, Monmouth declared himself King and proceeded to Bridgewater.

The aftermath of the rebellion saw brutal atrocities committed by the Government, particularly by Colonel Kirk and his soldiers, known as Kirk's lambs, who inflicted unspeakable horrors upon the peasants.

The University of Cambridge resisted his attempts to appoint a monk to a prestigious position, leading to a showdown. The King's insistence on appointing his own candidates, based solely on religion, led to conflicts with universities and the Church of England.

The King's subsequent attempt to prosecute the bishops failed, with a resounding public outcry in their support. Meanwhile, the Prince of Orange was invited to England by prominent figures concerned about the King's Catholic leanings.
