The geology of Egypt is uncomplicated. The whole flat land is alluvial. The hills on each side consist of limestone in the north, sandstone in the central area, and granite and syenite in the south. The granitic formation begins between the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth parallels, with some primitive rock intrusions reaching northward to lat. 27°10'. Above the rocks lie gravel and sand deposits, with some hard and some loose and shifting. Part of the eastern desert is rich in metals. Gold, copper, iron, and lead have been found, with emeralds near Mount Zabara, and other precious stones in the eastern desert. The flora is mainly dominated by dom and date palms, acacias, and the sycamore tree. Papyrus and lotus were also distinctive plants of Egypt.

"In ancient Egypt, they believed in multiple gods, some of which were incarnated in earthly forms. The Apis bull in Memphis, the Mnevis bull in Heliopolis, the Bacis bull in Hermonthis, and the white cow in Momemphis were all revered as gods.

Usurtasen, an ancient Egyptian hero, expanded Egypt's borders southward by 150 miles, reaching beyond the First Cataract to above the Second Cataract. The boundary drawn by Usurtasen between Egypt and Ethiopia mirrored the one established by the British Government in 1885 between Egypt and the Sudan. This boundary, though somewhat artificial due to the course of the great river, was considered convenient between Assouan (Syene) and Khartoum. Usurtasen's conquests elevated him to legendary status in the Old Empire, with myths embellishing his feats. The Nile River, Egypt's lifeblood, brings both blessings and dangers. Its annual flood, predictable and enriching, ensures fertility by spreading nutrient-rich alluvium over the land. However, rare events like excessive rainfall in Abyssinia can lead to catastrophic floods, while droughts can result in famine. The Nile's fluctuations have historically impacted Egypt, with periods of abundance and scarcity shaping the nation's history.|"1. What did Usurtasen achieve in expanding Egypt's borders?

Long ago, a significant event occurred in the royal palace, likely a tragedy such as illness or death. The king believed he faced divine punishment and sought the reason for his suffering. Some believed the priests revealed the truth, accusing the king of taking another man's wife. Alternatively, Sarah may have confessed. The Pharaoh, upon learning the truth, confronted Abraham and instructed him to leave with his wife and possessions. Abraham's stay in Egypt, during a period between the eleventh and thirteenth dynasties, marked a significant chapter. Egypt had seen previous Semitic immigrants seeking refuge in its fertile lands. The influx of Semitic wanderers gradually influenced Egypt's culture and language. The peaceful nation was soon to face challenges from the east, with movements across Asia threatening global peace. The Hittites' expansion and Elam's military actions were among the early signs of a changing world.|"6. What were among the early signs of a changing world mentioned in the text?

Only one account exists of the invasion that led to Egypt falling under foreign rule. According to the historian Manetho, as relayed by Josephus, a king named Timæus ruled Egypt when ignoble men from the east invaded due to divine displeasure. They easily conquered the land, enslaved and killed many, destroyed temples, and established Salatis as their king. Salatis fortified the land against Assyrian threats, rebuilding and garrisoning the city of Avaris. The invaders, known as Menti or Sati, were a mix of various races seeking wealth and settlement. Egypt, divided and unable to field an army, succumbed to the overwhelming force without a battle. The conquerors iconoclastically destroyed temples and statues, erasing Egypt's existing civilization. The devastation was so severe that few monuments from that time remain, leaving a void in Egypt's historical record.|"1.

Fortunately, not the whole country was taken over. It seems that the Hyksôs only occupied certain areas of Egypt, like the Delta, the Lower Nile valley, and the Fayoum district. Cities like Elephantine, Thebes, and Abydos were spared. Even though they had to show submission to the Hyksôs, pay tribute, and acknowledge their rule, these cities maintained some independence. The monuments in Thebes from the eleventh and twelfth dynasties were unharmed. Structures in Lower Egypt that were not significant or too sturdy were left untouched. The pyramids were mostly unscathed, although their sanctity might have been violated. The obelisk of Usurtasen I in Heliopolis remained standing. The smaller tombs at Ghizeh were largely undisturbed. Egyptian civilization faced a setback but managed to recover and even surpass its former glory after the invasion.|"1. What areas of Egypt were occupied by the Hyksôs invaders?

"The ""Shepherds"" introduced the worship of Sut or Sutekh into Egypt, associating him with the sun. He was hailed as the ""great ruler of heaven"" and linked to Baal later on.

"If we consider Joseph under the rule of one of the ""Shepherd Kings,"" it is plausible to connect him with Apepi. Apepi, a ruler over all of Egypt like Joseph's Pharaoh, worshipped a single god.

He was known for his strong will and carried out changes decisively. The transition from the Hyksôs rule after two centuries or so was relatively smooth due to the conquerors' decline from their once dominant state. The conquered people in Upper Egypt maintained their own administration and culture, paying tribute but retaining self-respect.

It appears that Apepi, the ruler, was compelled to take up arms eventually. Unfortunately, we lack a detailed account of the ensuing war led by this king.

Thothmes III, an Egyptian ruler, is sometimes likened to Alexander the Great, but this comparison is exaggerated. Thothmes was a skilled conqueror, yet his achievements were minor compared to Alexander's vast empire.

He died after a 54-year reign, aged around 60. Meanwhile, the Israelites thrived in Goshen under Thothmes, protected by Joseph's legacy. Thothmes' son, Amenhotep, continued his military legacy, subduing nations and engaging in brutal warfare. Despite his victories, his barbaric practices tainted his reputation.|"1.

Seti, an ancient Egyptian ruler, is known for constructing magnificent palaces and tombs. While the pyramids impress with their sheer size and engineering, Seti's rock-tomb stands out for its complexity and beauty. The rock-tomb is a series of chambers, corridors, and halls adorned with intricate paintings depicting scenes of gods, genii, and processions. As one progresses deeper into the tomb, they encounter a variety of detailed artwork, including serpents, mummies, and mythological figures. At the heart of the tomb lies an alabaster sarcophagus surrounded by elaborate decorations. In contrast, Ramesses, another notable king, is remembered for colossal statues of himself that adorn the rock-temple of Ipsambul. These statues, each seventy feet tall, exude a sense of majesty and grandeur, reflecting the king's vanity.

The leader of the alliance was an African prince named Marmaiu, who hailed from Africa and was the son of Deid. Marmaiu planned a serious attack on Egypt not for looting but for conquering. Initially, he gathered his local forces from Lubu, Tahennu, Mashuash, Kahaka, totaling around 25,000 to 30,000 men. Subsequently, he enlisted additional troops from five other nations, possibly raising his army to 35,000 to 40,000 soldiers. These foreign auxiliaries were from Akausha, Luku, Tursha, Shartana or Shardana, and Sheklusha. Modern historians link these nations to the Achaeans, Laconians, Tyrsenians, Sardinians, and Sicilians.

After conquering Egypt, the Assyrians organized the territory by dividing it into twenty regions, each ruled by a governor and guarded by an Assyrian garrison. Most governors were Egyptians, but some were Assyrians. The conqueror, satisfied with the arrangement, returned to Nineveh, leaving behind a record of his conquests. Egypt remained under Assyrian control for about three to four years. However, the struggle resumed when Tehrak, taking advantage of Esarhaddon's illness, reclaimed the disputed territory. Religious ties between Ethiopia and Egypt aided Tehrak, but physical force ultimately determined the outcome. Assyria swiftly responded, defeating Tehrak and reclaiming Egypt.

For three years, Egypt was triumphant, feeling powerful once again. However, Nemesis struck. In 605 B.C., Nabopolassar of Babylon, seeking to regain prestige, sent his son Nebuchadnezzar to Syria to reclaim lost territories. Neco of Egypt faced him at the Euphrates, resulting in a devastating defeat for Egypt at Carchemish. Jeremiah vividly described the battle. Egypt's defeat was total, prompting a hasty retreat.

Herodotus, the earliest Greek historian, visited Egypt around the age of thirty to gather information for his work. He explored Egypt, from Elephantine to Memphis, describing the wonders he saw with enthusiasm. He witnessed battlefields, the pyramids, and the famous Labyrinth. After his visit, Egypt experienced a period of peace for about fifty years. However, in 406 or 405 BC, a rebellion led by Nepheritis brought about a war against Persia, resulting in the expulsion of the Persian garrison and the return of Pharaohs to the throne. This period of independence lasted about sixty years, bringing a brief revival to Egypt. Following Nepheritis, a time of unrest followed with frequent changes in leadership due to the fickle Greek mercenary soldiers. With the accession of Nectanebo I around 385 BC, Egypt saw improvements as he fortified the Nile mouths and ensured Egypt's defense without relying on foreign alliances.|"1.

When Persia decisively moved to subdue the rebellious province, it took only a few months to achieve. Persia's vast resources far surpassed Egypt's in men and money, creating a significant imbalance.
