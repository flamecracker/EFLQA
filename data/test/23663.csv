Throughout their journey in the boxcar, Tom caught only fleeting glimpses of Germany through the sliding door at stations where more prisoners were ushered in.

In the afternoon, friendly conversations were interrupted by the arrival of military prisoners in a crowded boxcar. These soldiers, British and Belgian, were captured after a German raid near Flanders. Despite their situation, the British captives, like Tennert and Freddie, remained cheerful and chatted about the war as if it were a cricket game. Tom, a non-combatant, observed the soldiers' resilience. Eventually, they arrived at their supposed destination, Slopsgotten, which turned out to be a misnomer. Tom found the name amusing and felt disappointed when he learned the actual name was Schlaabgaurtn. As they gazed at the distant battle line, Tom pondered the soldiers' experiences and the challenges of crossing into France.

The unfortunate captives were thoroughly checked and stripped of their belongings before being escorted to a nearby camp, referred to as a civilian camp but serving a broader purpose. They walked through the streets of the quaint town in a somber procession, observed by silent onlookers. Tom, feeling compassion rather than self-pity, noticed the many disabled individuals among the crowd. The camp was oval-shaped, enclosed by a high barbed wire fence, lacking electricity due to coal shortages. The former stables were transformed into living spaces, with makeshift shacks constructed from scavenged materials. Monotony and squalor defined daily life, with straw bedding and meager food. Visits from the Spanish Embassy often irked the camp's stern German commandant. Prisoners received packages from home, fostering camaraderie. Tom adapted to the camp's informal structure, engaging in conversations about various war experiences while embracing the camp’s laid-back atmosphere.|"1.

Archer had an eventful journey that could fill a book. He was finishing an apple when a torpedo hit the ship. He regretted not throwing the core faster. He jumped for a lifeboat, missed, swam to another, drifted to Ireland, then London. He got a job on a troop-carrying steamer, teased troops, collected souvenirs, and ended up in France. He wriggled into military service, rode a motorcycle, and was caught by Germans while mimicking Charlie Chaplin. Archer spoke of generals humorously and had a unique French accent. He joked about engine issues, suggesting ways to fix it. Tom, impressed, spread the word, making Archer a hero in the camp.
