The shape of the island hinted that more land might lie to the north due to geological formations and upheavals. Sutoto was set to return to Wonder Island, accompanied by the Chief and his family. A visit to Hutoton was proposed before boarding the ship. Upon boarding, the convicts were welcomed, and the paralytic was taken aboard. Supplies were gathered from the ships for the convict colony as the _Pioneer_ set sail north. A new island was discovered, and observations were taken using the sun to determine the season. Triangulation and nautical charts were used to navigate, along with Greenwich time. The previous island was named _Venture_, while the new one boasted lush vegetation. John and the boys landed with two boatloads, forming exploration parties. Signs of savages and potential cannibals were discovered, leading to a tense standoff and eventual fight with the natives.|"4. What was the name of the island discovered after leaving Venture?

The white man's Krishnos operate in caves that act as gun factories. Although he doesn't sacrifice for pleasure, he produces guns, ammunition, and explosive shells as his trade. John chimed in, noting that while savages kill without rules, white men have structured the act of killing. The Professor smiled at John's explanation, but the boys seemed uncertain. George suggested that the savage approach might be more sensible. The Professor agreed that while it might not be the most reasonable, it is the most logical. They digressed from the topic, discussing the upcoming vessel launch. John declined to accompany them, preferring to stay with his people. The Professor graciously accepted an invitation to visit in the future. Angel, the Orang-outang, entered and handed the Professor an envelope.

I was confident in my assessment of the mountain range below the town. Copper and silver deposits were visible in the area, promising a profitable venture for the locals. While exploring the southeastern side of the ridge, I discovered a fragment of a metal pot, possibly cast iron, along with other items of little value. Hidden within the pot fragment, protected by a rock shale, was an intriguing scrap that I thought might interest you. The men are in good spirits, and we anticipate returning soon. The marine pad we found seems to aid in celestial navigation for sailors. John recalled a mention of Wright, a former companion, but was puzzled by the unfamiliar name Walter. As we examined the V-shaped marks and arrow on the paper, we speculated about its significance, possibly indicating a location of ore deposits relative to a nearby landmark. This experience highlighted the value of hands-on learning and problem-solving, reinforcing the boys' independence and competence.|"1.

The marine pad we found seems to aid in celestial navigation for sailors. John recalled a mention of Wright, a former companion, but was puzzled by the unfamiliar name Walter.

"The boys had important work to do at the shipyard. They were preparing to launch a vessel designed by Harry and supervised by John. The ship was ninety feet long, with a deep keel and high bulwarks, made of oak from the forest. The engine was for auxiliary use, and coal was to be used for the boiler.

When the Chief and the men prepared to depart, they were joined by the Chief to witness their leaving at the shore beneath South Mountain. Before departing the village, items brought by ships for the Illyas were stored in the Chief's warehouse, and payments were made to those who had aided them. This occasion brought much joy. The sea was calm in the afternoon, offering a pleasant sail, but at night a strong breeze arose, varying in intensity. The next day, the sea turned choppy, causing over two-thirds of the natives to suffer from seasickness. John, along with the boys, administered a remedy discovered by Prof. Fischer and Dr. Reginald Pollard, which had remarkable effects, alleviating symptoms quickly. Despite sailing off course, the boys remained hopeful of reaching Wonder Island, eagerly searching for land but only spotting distant lights in the east, igniting excitement and anticipation among all onboard.|"1.

"The locals, usually eager to find signs of their presence, walked around but found no evidence. The land was elevated but not rough, except for the west coast. ""Why does cocoa thrive on one island but not the next, with bananas growing elsewhere?"" pondered Harry. The answer lies in the soil, which determines what plants can grow. Identical soil produces similar vegetation worldwide. The group spent hours searching the south without finding any human presence. They returned to the ship, planning to sail south, land every ten miles, explore the interior, and survey the island. Using triangulation, they measured distances on land and sea to map the island accurately."|"1. What did the locals find when they walked around the island?

Just like animals, plants need food they can digest. Trees, for example, digest their food before consuming it. Larvae also follow a similar process. Larvae are early forms of organisms before they fully develop, like tadpoles turning into frogs. Insects like grubs or caterpillars are examples of larvae. During an expedition, the boys encountered a bear. George shared honey with the bear, creating a fun and amusing scene. The boys explored the area, taking in the beautiful ocean views before camping for the night. The next morning, they enjoyed a refreshing swim at a nearby bay before continuing their journey.|"1.
