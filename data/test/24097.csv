The Native American prefers to cause trouble at night, and the horsemen wouldn't be able to hide their arrival, making them vulnerable in the initial clash with the red men. The Sioux chieftain, beside a narrow window on the lower floor, devised a plan to help the brother and sister, especially the latter, in their dire situation. It was a risky plan, and he knew the odds were against its success. Despite this, he kept his thoughts hidden from Melville, who could only wait and hope for divine protection. As Melville pondered, he sensed a strange smell outside, connecting it to the war-party's silence. The Sioux set fire to Archibald Clarendon's barn, which was close to the house, ensuring the flames would spread. The barn was easily ignited due to the dry timber and stored hay, posing a threat to the house. The barn faced away from the house, hidden from view, making it an ideal target for the marauders. While the Sioux could have set fire to the house directly, it would have required more effort and time. As the Sioux and Melville conversed quietly upstairs, Dot prayed by the bed, moving the chieftain with her faith. The Sioux listened for signs of fire spreading from the barn, ensuring the safety of the house. The weather worsened, hinting at an incoming blizzard.|"1.
