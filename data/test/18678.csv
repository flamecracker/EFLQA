The commander, rejoining the other officers, discussed the situation. He noted that Captain Wright of the Muskegon was in charge and directed him to take possession of the Raven as a prize. The St. Regis, being a fast ship, had to join the chase immediately.

After giving the order to Mr. Amblen, Christy bid farewell to the officers who left in their boats. He waited for the blockaders to arrive before moving the ship, ensuring the safety of the crew. Meanwhile, he sent a letter to the acting admiral informing him of his arrival and following his orders.

As the Muskegon approached the Raven, Captain Wright received the prize from Christy. There was no time for compliments as Christy was in a hurry. The crew was recalled, except for one officer to assist the Muskegon's team and provide information at the prize court in New York.

The St. Regis detached from the Raven and Christy observed the chase through his glass. Despite the efforts of the blockading fleet, many blockade-runners managed to slip through.
