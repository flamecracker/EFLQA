"An old print, showing the moment when the mainmast of the _Guerrière_ was destroyed by the American frigate's fire, causing the _Guerrière_ to turn into a wreck. The _Constitution_ suffered minimal damage, with a broken spanker gaff and shot holes in her topsails. The _Constellation_, pictured here, is smaller than the _Constitution_, rated at 38 guns compared to 44. Although the _Constellation_ didn't fight in the War of 1812, it represents the armed American frigates of that time. The _Constellation_ is now docked at the Naval Training Station in Newport, R. I. The War of 1812 was a victory for the American spirit of freedom, akin to later global struggles. It was a contest for survival and freedom, much like the American Revolution. The causes of the war stemmed from Britain's disregard for neutral nations' rights during its conflict with Napoleon. The United States demanded freedom at sea, leading to the war cry ""Free Trade and Sailors' Rights!"" which highlighted the interference with American shipping and impressment of American sailors by the British."|"1.

In June 1812, the United States declared war on Great Britain, but they were ill-prepared. The regular army was small and poorly trained, lacking experience in warfare. The reliance was on militia and volunteers, but many regiments were unorganized mobs. The War of 1812 faced challenges like short enlistments, divided authority, and incompetent officers. The American navy was vastly outnumbered by the British fleet. New England, opposed to the war, even refused to provide militia troops. Despite internal divisions and lack of military strength, there was hope in the vulnerability of Canada to invasion.

The American territories near Lake Superior had a population of under five hundred thousand, with many being English immigrants or American Loyalists. These settlers were not ones to idly await any threat. The British, along with warlike Indians and the undefended Great Lakes, posed dangers that were not fully considered by those advising war. Plans were made without accounting for the challenges of transportation in areas lacking roads, provisions, or navigable rivers. General William Hull, a respected veteran, was appointed to safeguard Detroit as a strategic point for advancing into Canada. Despite initial progress, Hull made a grave error by sending crucial supplies on a captured schooner, providing the British with valuable information. The British General, Isaac Brock, capitalized on this intelligence, setting the stage for a conflict that would test Hull's leadership and the resolve of his troops.|"1.

During the War of 1812, General Hull faced a challenging situation in Upper Canada. He was left without support from the American Government and had to deal with increasing British forces and hostile Native American tribes.

Two days after arriving in Amherstburg, General Brock demanded the surrender of the Americans. He cleverly pointed out the uncontrollable Indian forces allied with him, hoping to intimidate Hull. Hull feared for the safety of the women and children in Detroit, envisioning a massacre. However, he underestimated the strength of his troops behind the fort's defenses, which could have withstood Brock's smaller army. Hull's indecision led to his downfall as Tecumseh's warriors cut off his supplies. Brock, sensing Hull's weakness, boldly prepared to assault Detroit. Despite expecting heavy losses, the British advanced unopposed. Hull surrendered without a fight, losing Michigan to the British. The fall of Detroit and Fort Dearborn marked significant losses for the United States in the War of 1812. Hull faced a court-martial, found guilty of cowardice and neglect, but his sentence was commuted due to his Revolutionary War service. The British success was attributed to their alliance with the Indians, who employed brutal tactics.

Elliott's ambitious plan to challenge the British naval force on the Upper Lakes was somewhat thwarted by the loss of the _Detroit_. However, this setback did not deter the audacious American navy.

At twenty-eight years old, Perry possessed the spark of greatness and a commanding personality that inspired loyalty and sacrifice. Despite facing immense challenges, Perry fearlessly tackled them with unwavering confidence. His first task was to consolidate his divided forces, moving Lieutenant Elliott's schooners from Black Rock to Erie, risking capture but succeeding through vigilance and seamanship. Perry then focused on completing the larger vessels, including the brigs _Lawrence_ and _Niagara_. Although the ships were small and lightly armed, they were to become legendary.

Despite a shortage of men, Perry set sail with a smaller force than he had hoped for, including soldiers who were inexperienced at sea.

"Perry's good luck saved him from disaster. On the 2nd of August, he faced the challenge of floating his large ships over the shallow harbor bar at Erie. The British blockading force had disappeared, giving Perry a chance he couldn't miss. Perry placed his light schooners strategically to guard the channel while he worked on moving his bigger vessels. Using scows or ""camels"" to lift and float the ships, Perry and his crew managed to get the vessels across the shallow bar. Despite the challenging conditions and the return of the British fleet, Perry succeeded in moving all his ships to safety. Perry was eager to engage the British but faced delays as the enemy retreated to Amherstburg to wait for reinforcements. Perry's fleet anchored at Erie, and he received additional men under Commander Jesse D. Elliott, who took charge of the _Niagara_. After establishing his base at Put-in Bay, Perry awaited the British fleet. When the British finally approached on the 10th of September, Perry wasted no time in preparing for battle.

The plan to invade Canada was serious and deadly. The troops were to wait until they were very close to the enemy before attacking with bayonets and shouts. They were to remember the honor of their country, the rights being violated, and the suffering of their people. The conquest was based in Buffalo, with the initial goal of destroying the enemy's batteries by crossing the Niagara River from Black Rock. However, the operation faced setbacks. General Smyth's army was supposed to be three thousand strong but many were sick, leaving only twelve hundred to embark. Smyth hesitated to invade without the full force, and after several changes of plans, the invasion was abandoned. The troops, around four thousand in number, were disorganized and frustrated, leading to chaos and the eventual departure of General Smyth from the camp.|"1.

In September, General Hampton marched his troops from Lake Champlain to the Canadian border as instructed to join the movement against Montreal. He positioned his forces at the Chateauguay River, threatening Montreal and the St. Lawrence. Despite Secretary Armstrong's orders to advance and support Wilkinson's army, Hampton faced a formidable British force of fifteen thousand soldiers. Feeling unsupported and suspecting the government's intentions, Hampton's morale waned. When faced with Canadian militia led by Colonel de Salaberry, Hampton's troops were defeated, losing equipment and retreating with casualties. The British celebrated the victory, attributing it to the French-Canadian Voltigeurs. The failure was largely blamed on the government's neglect. The winter saw American troops retreating to log huts, accusing the Secretary of War of abandoning them. The British seized the opportunity to reclaim forts at Niagara, leading to further losses for the Americans.|"1. What was General Hampton instructed to do in September?

The American naval service had a proud history and high morale. Young officers served with veterans who had fought alongside heroes like Biddle, Barney, and Paul Jones. Many earned promotions for bravery in battles, like when they assisted Stephen Decatur in 1804, or supported Thomas Truxtun in 1799-1800. These sailors were volunteers, not forced into servitude, and they had faced dangers on merchant ships from the Caribbean to the China Sea. The American frigates were superior in speed and power, outmatching British ships they encountered. When war was declared, Commodore John Rodgers led a squadron to chase off British cruisers. Despite setbacks, like a gun exploding on the _President_, these sailors showed remarkable courage. Captain Isaac Hull's encounter with a British squadron near Barnegat demonstrated exceptional seamanship. The legacy of these brave sailors lives on, symbolized by the preserved _Constitution_ in Boston, reminding us of their valor and the nation's maritime heritage.|"1.

In the early days of American seafaring, New England sailors quickly saw the value of a daring escape. Even those who opposed the war on land, like the Federalists, praised Captain Hull and his ship. They had outmaneuvered the best British warships along the American coast, sparking a renewed sense of hope amongst the crew.

The English captain had ten Americans in his crew, but he would not force them to fight against their fellow countrymen.

Izard had predicted that withdrawing his forces from Plattsburg would make northeastern New York vulnerable to the British, and he was right. As soon as his troops began moving west, the British army, led by General Prevost, swiftly crossed the border with ten thousand soldiers.
