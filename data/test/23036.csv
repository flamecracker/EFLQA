"Dave had already expressed his gratitude to the hospital staff and bid them farewell. The two young naval officers then left the hospital and headed towards the waterfront. They soon boarded the ""Grigsby"" and informed the watch officer of their arrival. Dave noticed that the damaged forward gun had been replaced after the fight with German destroyers. They proceeded to the chart-room where Dave examined two papers that caught his attention. One document listed ships that had encountered mines in the area they were operating in. The other report detailed the sinking of a fighting submarine and a submarine mine-layer. Dave shared his observations with his fellow officers, suggesting the need for mine-sweepers to clear the mines on three specific shoals. He then met with a British admiral to discuss the situation further and secured three patrol boats equipped with sweepers. The admiral acknowledged Dave's efforts and expressed hope for positive results in the near future."|"1.
