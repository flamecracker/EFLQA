On the eve of the battle of Prestonpans, the Highland army is preparing to encamp under the Rock of Dunsappie on Arthur's Seat. The prince will gather his chiefs and nobles for a council at dusk, and at daybreak, they will march through the hedgerows and woods of Duddingston.

I hope that a Peace Congress will not be held in Edinburgh, for the Castle's influence could sway the delegates. They might end up buying Scottish souvenirs and getting swept up in the culture. As my thoughts wandered, Salemina and Francesca shopped for Scottish trinkets, immersing themselves in the local heritage.

Sydney Smith once reminisced about his time in Edinburgh, praising the city for its excellent hearts and cultivated minds despite the odious smells and barbarous sounds of the past. He critiqued the prevalent Scotch humor and dialectics of the time. Today, Edinburgh has evolved, shedding its negative aspects while retaining its intellectual charm. The dinner conversations in Edinburgh are a blend of wit and dialectics, providing a solid foundation for engaging discussions. The customs at the dining table may differ slightly from what we are used to, but the grace and skill with which the hostess carves and serves are notable. The Scottish butler, resembling an elder of the kirk, adds a touch of sanctity to the dining experience. The men dress in a manner similar to others, with no kilts in sight, unlike Lord Napier's valet's fashion mishap. Scotswomen exhibit a sober and stylish taste in their attire, reflecting the influence of Presbyterianism in their society. The society's diversity in Presbyterianism may contribute to their reserved fashion choices. The ladies of the 'smart set' in Edinburgh flaunt French fashion, while others opt for more conservative styles. Lord Cockburn's vivid description of Mrs. Rochead's regal presence showcases the extravagant fashion of the aristocratic women of his time. The narrator's ability to quote Lord Cockburn surprises their dinner companion, an earl, highlighting the charm of being well-read and adaptable to new environments.|"1.

An unusual air of excitement filled 22 Breadalbane Terrace a few days ago. The lodgers were buzzing with activity as some prepared to depart. Mrs. Menzies, known as Mingess, headed back to Kilconquhar, or Kinyuchar as she called it. Miss Cockburn-Sinclair, soon to be Coburn-Sinkler, left for Inverness after buying her wedding attire. The Hepburn-Sciennes, soon departing, had finally mastered the pronunciation of their names. Cleaning fervor took over the place, with scrubbing brushes and brooms in action. The stair carpets hung out to dry in the garden, while Susanna polished the stair-rods. Pails of suds dotted the halls, and the dinners served resembled suburban American washing-day meals. On May 19th, the castle was a hive of activity as distinguished guests arrived for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The Lord High Commissioner and the Marchioness of Heatherdale were expected at Holyrood Palace, and a grand reception was planned with regal pomp and ceremony.

I am a firm believer in the Free Kirk, a branch of Presbyterianism that values freedom and independence. The word 'free' appeals to me as a citizen of a republic. My interest in this denomination was sparked by a young Edinburgh minister known as the Friar, who captivated me with his eloquence and passion for the principles of the Free Church. The movement for the Free Church was born out of a desire to abolish the patronage of livings, which allowed certain individuals to appoint ministers without consulting the congregation. This resonated with me as a believer in individual freedom. The Friar vividly described the historic events that led to the formation of the Free Church, highlighting the sacrifices made by ministers who stood up for their beliefs. Inspired by his words, I am proud to align myself with the principles of the Free Church and am eager to contribute to its community.|"1.

The pipe organ is quickly becoming popular in Scottish churches, but some still prefer the simplicity of acapella hymns. The unaccompanied singing of hymns has a special solemnity that deeply moves me. The thunderous sound of the organ and the angelic voices of the choir can elevate one's spirit during church music. The offertory is a quiet time without music, allowing for reflection on giving. Country ministers have keen hearing to estimate the collection. The clinking of coins in the contribution boxes is a unique sound. Bonnet fashion can indicate social status in church congregations. Military services are held at St. Giles', with soldiers marching to the church of their choice. The sound of soldiers marching to 'Abide with Me' is majestic and inspiring.

During the time of Assemblies, the atmosphere is mostly clerical and ecclesiastical. The two main church groups here hide any rivalries and jealousy, if they have any. The Church of the Disruption and the Church of the Secession have been spending time together, hinting at a future union. It's hard to believe that in earlier times in Edinburgh, people faced severe penalties for seemingly minor offenses. For instance, Margaret Sinclair was reprimanded for fetching water on the Sabbath, and Janet Merling had to repent publicly for hiding an unbaptized child named Janet in her home for twenty weeks. Times have changed though, as shown by the rapid acceptance of Mrs. Siddons, a famous actress, by the Church Assembly. Scottish hospitality shines through with numerous invitations flooding in as the city fills with ministers. Miss Jean Dalziel, a lively personality, advises attending various events to experience both the religious and secular sides of Edinburgh's society.|"1. What is the main focus of the text passage?

D. The acceptance of a famous actress by the Church Assembly
E. The advice given by Miss Jean Dalziel"|B. The rivalry between two church groups|Yes
During the time of Assemblies, the atmosphere is mostly clerical and ecclesiastical. The two main church groups here hide any rivalries and jealousy, if they have any. The Church of the Disruption and the Church of the Secession have been spending time together, hinting at a future union. It's hard to believe that in earlier times in Edinburgh, people faced severe penalties for seemingly minor offenses. For instance, Margaret Sinclair was reprimanded for fetching water on the Sabbath, and Janet Merling had to repent publicly for hiding an unbaptized child named Janet in her home for twenty weeks. Times have changed though, as shown by the rapid acceptance of Mrs. Siddons, a famous actress, by the Church Assembly. Scottish hospitality shines through with numerous invitations flooding in as the city fills with ministers. Miss Jean Dalziel, a lively personality, advises attending various events to experience both the religious and secular sides of Edinburgh's society.|"2.

"Mrs. M'Collop, a keen observer and critic of the Edinburgh pulpit, offers her candid opinions while going about her morning tasks. As she tidies the bed, she shares her thoughts on various ministers. From Dr. A's intermittent brilliance to the wearisome sermons of Dr. B, she leaves no detail unscrutinized. The new assistant, a man of small stature with grandiose words, fails to impress her, unlike the seasoned Dr. C, who prays for all. Mr. D's penchant for intricate Old Testament passages and reliance on written sermons draw her disapproval. Her own minister, Mr. E, is praised for weaving sound doctrine into his sermons, earning him her respect. Dr. F, known for weeping over congregational sins, is dubbed the ""greetin' doctor"" and mourned for his late wife, a loss felt keenly by the community."|"1.

Francesca surprised us by declining to attend the semi-royal Scottish court. She preferred not to face the crowds and the Reverend Ronald that evening. Lady Baird was to guide us, and her nephew, Sir Robert, was to accompany us. I mentioned to Sally that Francesca's strong feelings towards the Reverend Ronald might lead to something more. We often strolled through the Old Town, visualizing its historical landmarks. The narrow streets were once filled with debris thrown from upper windows. King James VI even wrote to ensure everything was in order for his wife's arrival. The Old Town's wynds and closes were home to nobility and senators, making it the Court End. The Canongate housed many distinguished figures, providing rich material for Mally Lee's tales.|"1. What surprised Francesca's friends about her decision regarding the Scottish court?

Salemina expressed her concerns about Willie Beresford's place of residence, wanting him nearby. I reassured her that Pettybaw was the perfect spot. Excited about our new life, we envisioned our stone-floored kitchen, the box-bed for Jane Grieve, and our garden with 'neeps' and marrows.

The following day was both joyful and exhausting. Salemina and I rearranged every piece of furniture in our small cottage, debating over the ideal placement. We stored away the unattractive ornaments and replaced them with our own lovely decorations. The sitting-room contained only two pictures, one depicting a peculiar scene of a Fireman's Life, and the other showing Burns being called from the plough by the Spirit of Poetry. We beautified the rooms with flowers and potted plants, assigned bedrooms, and shopped for household items. We were kept busy and content, eagerly awaiting Francesca's arrival. Upon her arrival, we welcomed her warmly, proud of our cozy new home. Francesca was pleased with everything, from the quaint village to the antique 'tirling-pin' on our door. We received letters from Edinburgh, including one from Willie, expressing his desire for us to settle in Fifeshire. He mentioned a visit to Rowardennan Castle, where we might meet his friend Robin Anstruther.|"1. What did Salemina and the speaker do in their small cottage the following day?

In times of joy, Salemina, Francesca, and I sometimes have our small disagreements, but in times of trouble, we are united. A wise Providence sent us Jane Grieve to keep us from being too happy in Pettybaw. Plans from above for the guidance of human beings are always effective, and this was no different. We had arranged for a carriage from the inn to bring her, and when it arrived, we expected to see the rosy little Jane we had imagined. Instead, an elderly lady in worn black attire, carrying a tin cake-box and a baby's bath-tub, introduced herself as Miss Grieve. She was too old to call by her first name, too delicate to address by her last name, so Miss Grieve she remained. Francesca and I burst into laughter while Salemina led her inside. We may have to make adjustments for Miss Grieve, but we will face this challenge together.|"1. What do Salemina, Francesca, and the speaker have in times of joy?

Walk up the stream to Habbie's Howe, where all the joys of spring and summer flourish. Between two birch trees, over a small waterfall, the water falls with a gentle noise. A deep pool, crystal clear, kisses the grass gently. To get there, turn from the inn, passing a cottage where a lady offers two rooms for rent. Moving ahead, you'll see the house where Mary, Will'am Beattie's sister, passed away. Then, a cottage with a lady in a widow's cap enjoying tea in the bay window. Further down, you'll find the Disagreeable Woman's house. Across the road, a gate leads to a path bordered by a stone wall and a ploughed field. Despite our curiosity, we hesitated to open the gate until two women approached. We asked about the path, but received no clear answer. The next day, we couldn't resist and entered the enchanting path, admiring the beauty of the pasture and the farmstead ahead.|"1.

The scent of 'white-blossomed slaes' filled the air, and the hills were vibrant with golden whin and broom, or flushed with the purply-red of the bell heather. We heard the cushats' call from a nearby bush. A hedgehog cautiously moved along the ground, curling up at the slightest noise. Women worked in the fields nearby, a common sight here. An elderly man joined me on the bench, sharing his lonely life story. As we reached the fishing village, we met a strong fishwife. We climbed a cliff to gaze at the sea, where rock birds nested. The guillemots' parenting challenges were fascinating.|"1. What did Willie gather while the speaker sat on the old bench?

Mrs. Phin, a toothless old lady, sometimes misplaces her false teeth, believing they might be in the rice. The kirkyard where Rab, the family dog, will be buried is a peaceful place with ancient tombstones. Nearby, Mrs. Bruce, the butcher, has a unique ship figurehead in her front yard. The figurehead was intended for a ship called the Sea Queen but was never used. Mrs. Bruce believes that the figurehead attracts customers to her shop. Across the street, an elderly woman spends her days playing with dolls and reading the family Bible.|"2. What do the family dogs do during Alexander's meals?
