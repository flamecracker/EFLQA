The morning dawned gray and somber, with a few snowflakes drifting down, foretelling a heavy storm. Hovering high above a desolate, untamed land, they gazed upon vast forests, snow-clad rocks, and towering mountain peaks. The young inventor, undaunted, warned of peril as frozen particles threatened to tear the gas bag. Despite the chaos of the hailstorm and the airship's tumultuous movements, Tom remained composed, adjusting controls and monitoring gas levels. To ease their fears, he delegated tasks, diverting attention from the danger. As the storm intensified and the airship ascended, Tom observed the barometer, indicating their slow ascent due to gas leaks. Explaining the meteorological phenomenon of hail, he reassured his companions, demonstrating courage and resourcefulness in the face of adversity.|"1.

"""That's correct,"" interrupted Mr. Parker, who was listening to the young inventor. ""Descending into this hailstorm may turn it into a harmless rainstorm.

"""Yes, there are many Native Americans in this area,"" replied the elderly prospector, ""but not as many Eskimos.

""It's too dark to see much,"" Ned objected. But this was resolved when Tom powered up a dynamo and brought out a portable searchlight that illuminated the RED CLOUD. The only concern was the gas bag, as hailstones couldn't harm the iron or wooden structure. Tom assured them that he had the materials to repair the damage.

""We'll stay here until we're ready to continue,"" Tom announced as he inspected the craft. Abe Abercrombie mentioned that the local Indians might not be friendly, but they would wait and see.

On the third day in the cave, the adventurers were almost done fixing the gas-bag. Mr. Parker went out for more observations. Suddenly, a yell echoed, and an unexpected visitor rushed in. Everyone armed themselves, including Mr. Parker, who had overcome his initial fear of the Indians approaching. Tom noticed the professor examining his gun out of curiosity rather than for use. About a hundred fur-clad Indians were spotted from the cave's entrance, armed with old guns, spears, bows, and stones. A chief approached with a demand for food in exchange for letting them stay. Abe, one of the adventurers, decided to stand firm and not give in to their demands, as they were soon planning to leave. Abe firmly told the chief that they couldn't spare any supplies, as they needed them for the journey ahead.|"1. What did the unexpected visitor rushing into the cave cause the adventurers to do?

"There was a moment of pause among the locals. Then they appeared to confer with the leader. It was brief. They sprinted and swiftly moved towards the cavern.

That morning, the Red Cloud sped ahead smoothly after enduring a hail storm with no lasting harm. High above, they dined while passing over vast snowy landscapes and icy mountain peaks resembling polar icebergs. Exploring the Arctic, they spotted scattered tribes of indigenous people living off hunting and fishing, a harsh life that they had experienced enough of. As they soared, the young inventor manipulated the airship's controls, spotting Andy's craft in the distance. Despite Andy's attempts to outpace them, Tom remained confident in the Red Cloud's superiority. Aware of Andy's strategy to follow them, Tom strategized to stay ahead, knowing Andy's limitations. Later, Tom discovered that Andy's airship was not entirely his creation but built with professional help. Tom remained determined to outfly Andy, confident in his future plans for an even faster aircraft.|"1. What did the Red Cloud endure that morning before speeding ahead smoothly?

The plan was a success. Abe, Mr. Damon, and Mr. Parker created a commotion at the ice cave where the Foger locals were stationed. The noise reached the gold excavation site where Andy and his father were working. Mr. Foger hurried towards the cave, leaving Andy with his gun on guard.

Later, the three men, who had left the cave when Mr. Foger rushed to investigate, joined Tom and Ned to secure their newfound discovery. They decided to protect it vigilantly, moving supplies closer to the mine and constructing an igloo for shelter.
