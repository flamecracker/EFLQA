In my introduction to _By Pike and Dyke_, I pledged to recount the final stages of the Dutch War of Independence in a future tale. The conflict was too extensive and intricate to fit into a single book. The previous volume concluded with the demise of the Prince of Orange and the fall of Antwerp. This sequel covers the phase when England, long a covert supporter of Holland, openly engaged in the war. England's involvement significantly contributed to Holland's triumph. Initially, the war was defensive, centered in Holland and Zeeland against overwhelming odds. With England's entry, the conflict expanded, securing Dutch independence through the defeat of the Armada, the capture of Cadiz, and the defeat of the Holy League by Henry of Navarre, aided by English forces and resources. The Reverend John Vickars of Hedingham prayed for Holland's deliverance on December 6, 1585. England's support for the Dutch cause dates back to their struggle against Spanish oppression.|"1.

The English fleet set sail for Cape St. Vincent, hoping to encounter part of the Armada. Drake landed at Faro, stormed the fort, and took control of the harbor. Despite the massive Spanish fleet in Lisbon, Drake planned to attack. However, orders from England prevented him from entering the Tagus.

Parma's army in Dunkirk suffered due to cold and wet conditions. Philip's orders to start the Armada were delayed by Santa Cruz's death. The Duke of Medina-Sidonia's lack of knowledge further postponed the expedition. Elizabeth's negotiations for peace failed, leading to England's readiness for defense with 100,000 men prepared to confront the invaders.|"1. What did Drake do upon landing at Faro?

The fleet included galleons, galleasses, galleys, and armed merchant ships. The Armada carried provisions to sustain 40,000 men for six months. Despite efforts to prepare, the English navy faced shortages, sickness, and a lack of supplies, causing despair among the officers.|"5.

A week later, the weather cleared, and on August 9th, Geoffrey saw fifteen ships at daybreak. Among them were the galleons of Calderon and Ricaldo, the _Rita, San Marcos_, and eleven other vessels. Signals flew from all, but the high sea made it hard to lower a boat. That night the storm raged, and in the morning, Geoffrey's ship and the others, except Calderon's, steered north. Ricaldo and De Leyva aimed for the Orkneys to refit. Calderon sailed south and met Sidonia with fifty ships. They navigated west of Ireland, most reaching Spain with crews weakened by sickness. De Leyva's ships faced bitter cold towards the Orkneys. The storm, sailors unaccustomed to cold, disease, and famine, forced De Leyva to head south. Some ships wrecked on islands, the rest hoped for shelter in Ireland. The Irish, co-religionists, and allies, turned against the Spanish. Wrecked crews were murdered by natives along the coast. Geoffrey, like others, suffered and worked tirelessly aboard the galleon. Surviving ships faced more disasters, with many crews perishing. Sir Richard Bingham of Connaught tried to rescue the survivors, but the fate of the Spanish Armada was grim.|"1. What did Geoffrey see on August 9th at daybreak?
