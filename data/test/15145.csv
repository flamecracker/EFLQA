Once upon a time, the tale of Little Red Riding Hood took a twist. As she journeyed to her grandmother's house, a cunning Wolf tried to deceive her. But Red Riding Hood stayed on the path and warned her grandmother about the Wolf's hungry eyes. When the Wolf arrived at the grandmother's house pretending to be Red Riding Hood, the wise old woman saw through his plan. She tricked the Wolf by offering him a bucket of water that smelled of meat. The Wolf, enticed by the scent, eagerly awaited Red Riding Hood's return. However, the grandmother outsmarted the Wolf, saving herself and Red Riding Hood from harm. In another enchanting story, a Queen was granted a daughter named Desirée by a magical crab.
