"""Herbert, I don't need to ask you that. We are always together, right? I wouldn't seek your company so persistently if I didn't enjoy it. I have plenty of offers for companionship that I turn down. Bob Stickney always invites me to his room, but he's lazy and more interested in having fun than studying. Then there's James Cameron, who is conceited and disagreeable. He's crafty and always scheming for his own gain. He hides his dislike for me because he thinks he may need my help in the future. I hope my mother remains with us for a long time. I was deeply saddened by Mr. Manning's passing. He was a penniless lawyer who married my mother. He was soft-spoken and managed to deceive her into thinking it was best for her to marry him. Mr. Manning's son, James, is nothing like him. Mark Manning, on the other hand, was slender and dark, with a soft voice and effeminate ways. He didn't enjoy rough sports like baseball but preferred to walk around in stylish clothes. It was unsettling to hear him refer to my mother as his wife. I could never accept him as a father figure, unlike my real father, who was a kind and respected man."""|"1. What is the speaker's attitude towards Herbert in the text passage?
