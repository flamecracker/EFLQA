In the play, George tried to get his rooster, Peter, to do a trick in the barnyard scene. George stood by the barn door with a piece of bread, hoping Peter would perch on his head and eat the crumbs. However, Peter only perched on the pony's back and refused to fly onto George's head. The second act ended without the trick. The third act took place in an orchard during apple-blossom time. Sue pretended to be lost, and Bunny searched for her. When Sue climbed an artificial apple tree to hide, Bunny pretended to look for her, making everyone laugh.
