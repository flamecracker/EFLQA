Mr. Wilkes explains that the effort required in this region to obtain wealth or sustenance is much less compared to the United States. For instance, the care of livestock that demands significant time in the US needs minimal attention here. He also mentions the high demand for timber in the Pacific region, especially oak for shipbuilding and other types like ash, cedar, cypress, and arbor-vitae for various purposes such as construction and fuel. The area boasts exceptional inland sounds and numerous harbors within the Juan de Fuca Straits, suitable for large vessels without significant risks. The northern coast includes islands like Vancouver's Island and Queen Charlotte Island, with pleasant climates and fertile soil for agriculture. The region teems with salmon, offering a bountiful supply of fish twice a year, along with other marine life like sturgeon, cod, and shellfish. The land is abundant in wildlife like elk, deer, bears, and waterfowl, making it a promising hub for commerce with staple goods like furs, grain, timber, and coal.

A look at the map reveals that a significant portion of British Oregon is watered by the Upper Columbia River and its tributary, the McGillivray or Flat Bow River, covering an estimated 20,000 square miles. The Bishop of Oregon, De Smet, described the Kootonais Indians' territory as a mix of forests and prairies, boasting birch, pine, cedar, cypress, coal, and lead mixed with silver. The source of the Columbia River was deemed crucial, with a delightful climate and rare extremes of heat and cold. Bishop De Smet believed the area could become a terrestrial paradise. The valleys of the Peace and Athabasca Rivers, located at the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, share a Pacific climate due to the winds from the Pacific reaching the region through mountain passes. The fertile land with abundant vegetation and wildlife was compared to the lush interior of Africa by Dr. Richard King. The Saskatchewan district, northwest of Minnesota, is rich in limestone, indicating fertile soil and potential for rapid colonization. Despite concerns about the climate, comparisons show that areas like Pembina in North America have similar climates to cities like Moscow in Europe.|"1.

The climate in the Saskatchewan district, much like European Russia, experiences extreme temperature fluctuations. The growth of cereals and vegetables depends more on the intensity and duration of summer heat rather than the severity of winter cold. For example, the northern shore of Lake Huron has a summer heat similar to Bordeaux, France, while Cumberland House on the Saskatchewan surpasses Brussels and Paris in summer heat. The United States Army Meteorological Register shows that the line of 70 degrees mean summer heat crosses the Hudson River and extends westward through various cities. Despite the favorable climate for agriculture in some regions, many areas like Athabasca and Saskatchewan are currently inaccessible to markets due to the presence of warlike indigenous populations. The route to the new El Dorado is likely via water from settlements along the Pacific coast, providing opportunities for settlement along the way.|"1.

From the accounts of seasoned miners who shared insights on the northern California coast and Oregon's gold mining spots, there was a strong belief that the Fraser River mines were an extension of California's goldfields. These miners speculated that the northern mines could be even more lucrative than those in California due to the northern regions being historically richer in gold. The Esquimault harbor in British Columbia, Canada, offered a serene and picturesque setting, resembling a tranquil Highland lake nestled amidst a pine forest. Despite its scenic beauty, the harbor seemed small upon arrival, contrasting with the grand expectations set in San Francisco. The nearby Victoria town, situated on a plateau overlooking the bay, boasted breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape, making it an ideal location for future development.|"1.

During my visit, the weather was delightful, warm during the day but not too hot, cool in the evenings with a gentle sea breeze. The long days stretching until nine o'clock at night, the lingering sunsets, and the twilight reminded me of Scottish summers. The landscape around Victoria is dotted with rocks, making farming challenging. Fields are small due to boulders and rock ridges. The scenery is a mix of English and Scottish, with pine and oak trees. Heavy dews and occasional rains keep meadows green. The winter is mild with occasional frost and snow. Vancouver's climate is often compared to England's but is milder and more stable. The southern shore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca has sandy cliffs, while the northern shore has a gradual ascent to snow-capped mountains. Vancouver praises the beauty and natural resources of the area, particularly highlighting Protection Island's picturesque landscape and New Dungeness's resemblance to the English coast.|"1.

Cook describes the houses and daily life of the indigenous people. Their homes were built with split boards, spacious enough for multiple families. Inside, small pens were used by each family. The houses had benches, boxes, and carved utensils like pipes. Giant human faces were carved on large tree trunks set up as posts. Despite being filthy, lazy, and having a principal diet of fish, they were skilled in the arts. They made clothes from pine bark, beat fine, and wove them tightly with intricate designs. The people had canoes without sails, used harpoons for fishing, and were adept at catching fish in nets. They also hunted sturgeon and whales. Their burial practices were unique, with corpses placed in canoes or upright boxes. Mount Coffin was a significant burial site. The cemetery was destroyed by a fire caused by American sailors, leading to a conflict with the natives.|"1. What were the indigenous people's houses made of?

After a baby is born, it is placed in a long wooden crib with moss as a pillow. The end where the head rests is elevated higher than the rest. A cushion is then put on the baby's forehead with a piece of cedar bark over it, secured by cords passing through holes on each side of the crib. The process of applying pressure to the head is gradual and believed to be not very painful. The appearance of the baby while undergoing this practice is described as alarming, with bulging eyes and contorted facial features. This tradition among indigenous tribes is a way to signify free birth. The Indians living on the north coast have harsher dispositions compared to those in the south, who are known for their cheerful nature. The southern tribes display mechanical skill in crafting pipes and working with iron and steel. The Indians from the plains have a diet consisting of fish, venison, and roots, and they live in movable tents. The Shoshones and Walla-walla are prominent tribes engaged in ongoing conflicts with the Blackfeet. The equestrian tribes, like the Flat-heads, display intelligence and adaptability to civilization. Their attire consists of deer-skin shirts, leggings, and moccasins, often embellished with beads. Through intermarriage and influence from the Hudson's Bay Company, these tribes are gradually blending into a peaceful society. The more northern tribes near the Oregon River show similarities to the Chippewayan tribes in terms of origin and lifestyle.|"1. What is the purpose of placing a cushion on the baby's forehead in the wooden crib?

The Native Americans have a unique way of catching salmon. They construct a weir across the river with only one opening where they place a basket resembling an eel trap. The fish can enter the basket through this opening. Attached to the basket is a smaller one where the fish are caught and cannot escape. Once the smaller basket is full, it is lifted without disturbing the larger one. The Indian religious beliefs involve polytheism and conjurers as priests. However, with the influence of scientific medicine and missionaries, their authority is diminishing. The discovery of gold in New Caledonia coincides with the laying of the Atlantic telegraph, symbolizing friendly communication and progress. The British government is informed of the gold findings in the Upper Columbia by Mr. Angus McDonald, indicating potential valuable deposits. The British authorities are considering the implications and challenges of taxing gold diggers in the region.|"1. What is the primary method used by Native Americans to catch salmon?

When mining becomes a profitable job and there's proof of abundant gold deposits, I suggest gradually increasing the license fee. This increase shouldn't be burdensome for miners. My authority to make this decision may be questioned since the areas in question are not under our direct control. However, I hope my intentions and the authority granted by the Hudson's Bay Company will justify my actions. If Her Majesty's Government agrees, I'm willing to visit the Couteau Mines next spring or summer to assess the situation. We've raised the monthly license fee from ten to twenty-one shillings to generate revenue for protecting life and property in the gold regions. We believe that serious miners will accept this fee increase to support the region's development.|"1. What is the main reason for suggesting an increase in the license fee for mining?

"I have important news to share with you. A proclamation was made by me, stating that the Crown holds rights to all gold in its natural deposits. It prohibits anyone from digging for gold without a license. Despite this, around seventy to eighty adventurers from the U.S. have traveled to the Couteau mines via Fraser River without obtaining licenses. I refrained from enforcing these rights without approval from Her Majesty's Government. Once I receive instructions, I will act accordingly. The Couteau gold mines are gaining immense attention from people in Washington and Oregon territories. The area is believed to be rich in minerals, akin to California or Australia. The influx of miners is causing excitement, with reports of intense activity in San Francisco. Boats and canoes are ferrying individuals to Fraser River, with accidents occurring due to dangerous rapids. The American steamer ""Commodore"" arrived with gold miners, mainly from San Francisco, some of whom are British subjects. Despite concerns about the influx of foreigners, the trade route through Fraser River could benefit the British territory.

"I have important news to share with you. A proclamation was made by me, stating that the Crown holds rights to all gold in its natural deposits. It prohibits anyone from digging for gold without a license. Despite this, around seventy to eighty adventurers from the U.S. have traveled to the Couteau mines via Fraser River without obtaining licenses. I refrained from enforcing these rights without approval from Her Majesty's Government. Once I receive instructions, I will act accordingly. The Couteau gold mines are gaining immense attention from people in Washington and Oregon territories. The area is believed to be rich in minerals, akin to California or Australia. The influx of miners is causing excitement, with reports of intense activity in San Francisco. Boats and canoes are ferrying individuals to Fraser River, with accidents occurring due to dangerous rapids.

At Fort Langley, there was an abundance of black flour priced at 9 dollars per hundred, and salt salmon, where you could get four for 1 dollar. Imagine the sailors facing scurvy with these provisions! The extravagance peaked when miners needed to buy tools for their work. At Sailor's Bar, rocker irons were sold for an ounce of gold each (16 dollars), and at Hill's Bar, they cost 30 dollars each. These irons are thin sheet-iron plates with holes to sift dirt. In San Francisco, one costs 2.5 dollars, but in England, it would be valued at 2 shillings. The challenges miners face in New Caledonia include high prices for essentials like quicksilver and nails. Despite the difficulties, the arrival of small steamers on the river will ease access to the mines. However, the growing tensions with the Indians might require military intervention. The miners' prices for goods will soon be regulated by competition from San Francisco, providing relief from exorbitant rates.|"1. What was the price of black flour at Fort Langley?
