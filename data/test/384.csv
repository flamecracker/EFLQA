The grand Palace was just as impressive as the white cathedral nearby. Marco, the son of the King, felt a mix of excitement and nervousness as he made his way up the wide marble steps, guarded by soldiers. The huge square around the Palace was bustling with people, all held in check by the soldiers. As he entered the Palace, he was met with richly dressed individuals who bowed deeply as he passed by.
