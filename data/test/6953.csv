Despite facing opposition from Vice Admiral Burroughs, Drake led an attack on Cadiz harbor, capturing Spanish ships loaded with supplies for the Armada. Subsequently, Drake's fleet intercepted and destroyed Spanish convoys headed for the Tagus, a port where the Armada was assembling. Though ordered to refrain from entering the Tagus, Drake challenged the Spanish admiral to battle, but the Armada did not engage.

The triumph was achieved solely by the allied cavalry, as the foot soldiers never made it to the battleground. This notable victory, an early one for the allies in open combat, sparked widespread celebrations. It not only shattered the myth of Spanish invincibility but also showcased how much the individual fighting skills of both sides had evolved during the war.

On the 12th, a hard frost began, and a strong gale blew from the southeast until Christmas. The town was cut off, with dwindling defenders and scarce ammunition. It took 4000 men to guard all walls and forts, but only 2500 were fit for duty. The archduke planned an imminent assault, and Vere feared they couldn't hold. Vere consulted officers on defending all areas with the current numbers or withdrawing to protect the town. Most officers wanted to hold all positions, despite insufficient troops. Vere, however, chose to send a message seeking dialogue with the archduke. This led to a delay in the attack. Later, reinforcements arrived, and negotiations were cut short. The siege was ultimately lifted, and the defenders strengthened their position.|"1. What weather conditions were the town facing during the siege?
