In the town of Portland, Maine, stands a historic house built by General Peleg Wadsworth in the late 18th century. This house gained local pride as the first brick building in town, but its fame grew when it became the childhood home of the beloved American poet. The daughter of General Wadsworth, with her husband and children, made this house their home. The mother, devoted to her children, created a nurturing environment. Even with a large family, both parents actively engaged with their children. Evenings were spent in the living room, where the mother read poetry, the father delved into history, and the children studied before enjoying music and stories.

In ancient Norse mythology, a fierce battle between heat and cold marked the beginning of the world. Initially, there was only a vast abyss called Ginungagap, separating the misty, cold, and dark world of Niflheim from the fiery, bright world of Muspelheim. Twelve rivers flowed from a fountain in Niflheim, eventually filling the abyss with ice. When sparks and warm winds from Muspelheim met the ice, it melted, creating a dense vapor that formed the giant Ymir and the cow Audhumbla. Ymir fed on the cow's milk, and she survived by licking salt and hoarfrost from the ice. Eventually, the cow freed the god Bori, ancestor of the gods, and Ymir, ancestor of the giants. The gods, led by Odin, Vili, and Ve, defeated Ymir, leading to the creation of the earth from his flesh, seas from his blood, mountains from his bones, and more. This marked the beginning of the gods' rule and the end of the giants' reign of terror.|"1. What was the initial state of the world according to Norse mythology?

This short poem is quite unlike the works of Longfellow that we studied earlier. It feels jittery and tense, making it seem choppy rather than smooth like the Charles River. Sometimes, words are left out, making it a bit hard to grasp at first. Browning also uses words in unique ways that Longfellow wouldn't have considered. The poem resembles a brief play with Napoleon at its center. Picture him in his uniform on a small hill, observing a city being attacked in the distance. Despite the battle's smoke clouding the city's walls and towers, Napoleon can hear the roar and see the thick clouds rising with each cannon shot. Suddenly, a lone horse with a young rider emerges from the smoke, galloping towards him without pause. The young man dismounts, his eyes gleaming as he delivers momentous news to the emperor.|"1.

On a Wednesday, following Trinity Sunday in 1431, the Maid of Arc, at about nineteen years old, faced her martyrdom. She was led before noon, guarded by eight hundred armed men, to a tall platform made of wood and plaster, with hollow spaces for air circulation. The height of the structure was terrifying, and the English intention was seen as cruel. However, there are different explanations for this. It is likely that their aim was merciful. The details of the execution are too complex to fully narrate here, but some aspects of Joan's behavior and that of the onlookers are worth mentioning. Joan faced an unfair trial of opinion, unlike earlier Christian martyrs. She was personally hated and viewed as a national threat. Despite rumors suggesting she was willing to recant, there is no solid evidence to support this claim. Her noble demeanor and angelic gentleness moved many to tears, even among her political enemies. The executioner, who had vowed to condemn her, was so moved by her grace that he repented. In her final moments, Joan showed extraordinary selflessness by caring for others before herself, proving her steadfastness and innocence.|"1.

Rabirius described a compassionate youth who helped convicts, even paying for the privilege. Pancratius, along with others, was dragged to prison while being mercilessly mistreated by guards and onlookers. The Mamertine prison, with two subterranean chambers, was a grim place with minimal light and ventilation. The prisoners endured cruel conditions, including being chained and sleeping on a stone floor. Despite pressure to sacrifice to the Roman gods, Pancratius bravely declared his faith in Christ. The prefect sentenced him and other Christians to face wild beasts in the Flavian amphitheater. The crowd cheered as they were led back to prison, but the confessors' dignified demeanor left an impression.
