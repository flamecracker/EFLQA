The group enjoyed a hearty breakfast after three days of scarce meals. Most men relaxed, smoking their pipes and enjoying a day of leisure. Village boys herded the animals into the woods for grazing.

The way your boys endured fatigue shows how vital a nation's prosperity relies on training its youth. England's strength stems from boys engaging in active exercises and outdoor games, preparing them for challenges like wars. In contrast, our youth lack spirit and strength in emergencies.

The day was freezing, marking the start of November's second week. Despite the cold, the group felt liberated as they journeyed. Meeting few people, they exchanged brief greetings.

The next morning, they rose stiff from the cold and walked through snow-covered landscapes. Arriving at a village, they entered an alehouse for food. The landlord engaged in conversation, and Ralph offered soup for their uncle. They continued their journey, crossing the Rhine and Moselle.

"""Yes, really,"" the colonel affirmed. ""Cambriels, a commendable fellow, submitted a favorable report endorsing your actions before he resigned. He highlighted your contributions and requested an immediate promotion for you, which was duly granted in the next Gazette.""""Under normal circumstances, it would seem illogical, boys; you wouldn't hold your current rank, let alone higher ones, without a solid grasp of your responsibilities. But these are exceptional times. Individuals who may have had brief military service years ago are swiftly elevated to high ranks to organize new troops. Although they may lack field command experience, their organizational skills are valuable. This rapid promotion, which would typically cause jealousy, is now necessary due to the unusual situation with most regular army officers being prisoners. Everyone is new and unseasoned, allowing for swift promotions without resentment. These promotions are temporary, and after the war, individuals will return to civilian life or be integrated into the regular army based on a new system. Some challenges may arise, but they will likely be manageable.""""I personally declined a general's rank recently as it would have required me to assume duties I'm unsuited for or organize new troops, diverting me from active service. If you continue excelling, boys, you could become colonels within six months. When a general recommends promotion for exceptional service, age is not a concern. Although you may not be recommended to command companies in a regiment, you could excel as staff captains, requiring clear thinking, courage,"|"1. What did Cambriels do before he resigned?

A message from the leader stated that the important papers would not be ready for another hour, which actually meant an hour and a half.

At a quarter to seven, the dispatches finally arrived and were quickly loaded into the car along with everything else. The Barclays settled in, the signal was given, and they began their ascent over the rooftops as the dawn broke, revealing a breathtaking scene. The boys were amazed by the view, feeling as if the earth was slipping away beneath them. They marveled at the speed and direction of their journey, comparing it to a boat on a fast-moving river at night. Monsieur Teclier explained the challenge of determining their speed and direction without any fixed reference points. He emphasized the importance of spotting breaks in the clouds to gauge their progress. The boys eagerly peered over the edge, observing the ever-changing cloud formations below. Monsieur Teclier outlined their projected path and the plan to descend below the clouds in five hours to assess their position relative to landmarks like the Loire River. They were prepared to adjust their course based on what they could see.|"1. What did the message from the leader indicate about the important papers?
