Kiddie enjoyed moving freely, hopping from tree to tree or flying. Benjamin Bat often crossed paths with Kiddie at night. Kiddie would stay hidden until Benjamin finished eating, finding him more pleasant then. Benjamin suggested sports at Farmer Green's yard, proposing a jumping contest with Mr. Frog and a race with Freddie Firefly. He recommended holding the activities in the evening.|"6.

Kiddie Katydid and Benjamin Bat were preparing for a night of sports at Farmer Green's place. Kiddie Katydid wanted to wait until late at night to join in because he knew he could jump and fly better then. Benjamin Bat, on the other hand, preferred to start the fun soon after dark because he felt lighter before eating much. When the night arrived, a crowd gathered eagerly, even though Benjamin had mentioned the fun would start almost at dawn. Mr. Frog, however, objected to the jumping contest with Kiddie Katydid, suggesting a swimming competition instead. Meanwhile, Benjamin Bat struggled to find a participant for the hanging-by-heels sport. Kiddie Katydid was clever enough to realize that Benjamin Bat might have other intentions, so he wisely avoided participating to avoid being eaten. Benjamin's bad temper made others wary, potentially spoiling the night's enjoyment.|"1.

Benjamin, the Bat, thought it was odd. ""He must have turned off his light to trick me. But I don't mind because Kiddie Katydid is hiding somewhere in this tree, and I'm famished. I'll find him.""

Benjamin darted among the maple branches, twisting and turning wildly. Kiddie Katydid watched closely, ready to jump if needed. Despite Benjamin's keen night vision, he couldn't spot the hidden Katydid, perfectly blending in on a leaf. Benjamin overlooked the grayish tree branches, focused only on the green figure.
