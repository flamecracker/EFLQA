In oriental tales, there are stories of demon-infested waters that bring doom to those who come in contact with them. For instance, in an Indian legend, a king unknowingly sends his followers to bathe in a lake inhabited by a man-eating demon. As they plunge into the water, they are all devoured by the dreadful creature. However, in another tale, Buddha, in his earlier form as a monkey, cleverly saves himself and his monkey brethren from a similar demon by having them drink from a tank using hollow reeds. These malevolent beings are akin to evil enchantresses in female form, such as the Baba Yaga, a tall, eerie hag with magical powers, who dwells in a hut supported by fowl's legs and rides in a mortar while sweeping away her tracks with a broom. She is a prominent figure in many strange stories that introduce us to the mystical world of folklore.|"1. What happened to the king's followers when they bathed in the demon-infested lake?

Among these, Friday stands out as the most significant. While the Russian name for Friday, _Pyatnitsa_, lacks the mythological depth of our own Friday and the French _Vendredi_, it was once revered by the old Slavonians in honor of a goddess akin to Venus or Freyja.

In Christian times, the goddess associated with Friday merged into St. Prascovia, often referred to as ""Mother Pyatnitsa-Prascovia."" It was believed that she roamed on Fridays and disliked certain activities, leading peasants to suspend them. For instance, sewing, spinning, or weaving on a Friday was considered a sin, as it could anger ""Mother Friday"" and bring about afflictions like sore-eyes or whitlows. The villagers took precautions like going to bed early on Fridays or sweeping their floors to appease her. Disregarding Mother Friday's honor was said to bring misfortune, as seen in the tale of a woman who spun flax on a Friday and faced the consequences. Similarly, Wednesday, connected to Odin, was considered sacred, with tales warning against dishonoring the day. These stories serve as cautionary reminders of the superstitions surrounding certain days of the week."|"6. What was the consequence faced by the woman who spun flax on a Friday?

Once upon a time, there was a myth about a magical pea that grew into the sky. In one version, a cock found the pea and called the hens to see it.

The Russian folk-tales offer vivid depictions of an underground world, contrasting the hazy images of a heavenly realm. These tales may not entirely reflect ancient Slavonic beliefs, as they blend influences from various cultures like Indian, Christian, Brahmanic, Buddhistic, and Mohammedan. One such tale tells of a wealthy moujik who buried money in two pots, one in his corn-kiln and the other under his farmyard gate. After his death, a fiddler accidentally falls into hell and meets the moujik, learning that the money was meant to be hidden from evil spirits. The fiddler's presence mysteriously preserves his fiddle-strings, and together they distribute the money to the poor, finding it multiplying endlessly. Eventually, they use the funds to construct a bridge, exhausting the pots' contents.|"1. What cultures have influenced Russian folk-tales according to the passage?

Many graceful legends are connected with birds. One bird, possibly the peewit, is always on the wing during dry weather, crying _Peet, Peet_, as if begging for water. Legend has it that when God created the earth and commanded birds to bring water to seas, lakes, and rivers, this bird refused, claiming it didn't need water. Enraged, God cursed it, forbidding it and its descendants from approaching water, only allowing them to drink rainwater collected in hollows. In another tale, sparrows were cursed for leading people to Christ's hiding place, while swallows helped during the crucifixion.

"The Peasant and the Prophets

Once upon a time, a peasant, known as the Moujik, was blessed with a bountiful harvest after his crops were ruined by hail. Grateful for the abundance, he decided to offer wax tapers to Prophet Elijah and St. Nicholas. As he carried two tapers, he met the Prophets disguised as travelers.
