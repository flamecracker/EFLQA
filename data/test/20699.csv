"""Dotty Dimple, also known as Alice, compared the fields to her Aunt Maria's green velvet toilet-cushion full of pins. The spiders had woven gauzy webs over the grass, sparkling like jewels in the sunlight. Dotty thought they would make perfect tablecloths for fairies if they existed. As they arrived at the church, Dotty admired the neat and peaceful people passing by. However, when Jennie Vance approached with her elegant feathered hat, Dotty felt a mix of admiration and envy. Jennie's vanity was evident as she ascended the steps gracefully. Dotty felt disheartened by her own dress, a hand-me-down from Prudy, with a darn in the skirt and lacking accessories. During the sermon, Dotty struggled to focus, counting nails and pipes, observing Mr. Gordon's red silk kerchief for warmth. Joining her class, taught by Miss Preston, Dotty listened to Bible verses, though her understanding sometimes faltered."""|"1. What did Dotty Dimple compare the fields to?
