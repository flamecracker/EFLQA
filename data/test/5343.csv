Una was deeply affected by the frightening situation, causing her to hold back her tears. Mary then comforted her, wiping away Una's tears with the lace frill of a spare-room pillow. The two forgave each other, cuddled up, and watched the shadows of the vine leaves on the moonlit wall until they fell asleep. Meanwhile, Rev. John Meredith was upstairs in the study, fully engrossed in preparing his sermon for the next day, unaware of the struggles faced by a lonely soul under his own roof. Mary, wearing Faith's school boots and an old black velvet cap, attended church. Despite her shabby appearance, she behaved conventionally and sang heartily during the service. Mary even mischievously stuck her tongue out at a woman who stared at her, much to Una's dismay. Mary, content with her education, declined Faith's suggestion to attend school and instead dedicated her time to cleaning and organizing the manse, transforming it into a tidy space.

Mary expressed concern about her father potentially remarrying, fearing that a stepmother might turn him against his own children. Una, unable to sleep, worried about this possibility, not wanting her family to be torn apart. Despite Mary's good intentions, her words had unintended consequences, causing Una distress.

Faith stood bravely in the church, her voice clear and strong. She explained how she and Una accidentally missed Sunday School due to a mix-up with the days of the week caused by Elder Baxter changing the prayer meeting day. She clarified that they cleaned the manse on the wrong day, thinking it was Monday when it was actually Sunday. Faith defended her father, who was unaware of the confusion, and expressed their love for him.

After Una wept and dried her eyes, she made her way to the spare room. The room was dim and musty as the blinds remained shut and the window closed for a long time. Aunt Martha wasn't keen on fresh air. However, since no one ever closed a door in the manse, it wasn't a big issue except when a minister stayed overnight and had to endure the stale air of the spare room. In a corner of the closet, Una found her mother's gray silk wedding dress. She knelt down, burying her face in the soft fabric, feeling a connection to her mother. Una whispered to the dress, promising to always remember and love her mother, even as she faced challenges, like trying to accept her stepmother as Mary Vance had warned. The following day, Una, despite her shabby clothes, took great care to look neat. She walked to the house on the hill, where Rosemary West sat in the garden looking troubled. Life in the house had been strained, with unsaid tensions between Ellen and Rosemary, and Norman Douglas's unpredictable visits.
